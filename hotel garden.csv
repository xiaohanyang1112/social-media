Would stay again
"," 9.0 ","The Hotel is easy walking distance from Bristol Temple Meads station. The reception staff was very welcoming and helpful. We were given a map and had an explanation how the get to our venue for the evening without really having to ask for it. The walk into the old town part was short. The room was clean and well arranged. The breakfast was good.","The room was very warm and we did not seem to be able to get the A/C to cool it down. Maybe it was just us... but I mentioned it as we checked out and felt that my comment was being taken serious.
A couple of things ran out during breakfast, and we were by no means late, and weren't replenished whilst we ate. We still manged to fill out tummies no problem though.","

High quality central hotel offering excellent value for money
"," 9.0 ","The receptionist lady (sounded Dutch) was very wlecoming and moved us to a room overlooking the garden at the back.
We only stayed one night as I was going to a concert at the Bristol Beacon and my wife was meeting old friends who live bear Bristol. The central location is perfect for the entertainment areas of the City and the local bars restaurants etc offer a range of cuisine and atmosphere.
Breakfast options were good though both coffee machines were broken - a kind staff lady made us both coffees from a machine behind the bar
Will definitely stay there again.","The power on the shower was rather too weak to wash my wife's very thick hair. This was at least partially the result of the head leaking. Some of the wall tiles were cracked (Room 106) as was the shower basin, both probably the result of movement at some point. I reported all this on departure.","

Adequate with reservations
"," 8.0 ","The room was fine, if a little cramped for two people. There were sufficient towels and soaps, etc. Although facing the busy road, the room was quiet. The reception staff were very pleasant, if rather slow in checking in & out. The hotel charge was adequate for the services we received. Bottled water was provided.","There were no USB ports in the room, surprising for an obvious business hotel.  There was a fridge but it had been turned off.  There were limited channels on the TV. We were encouraged to have lunch in the restaurant but when we arrived just before 12:00 we were asked to sit in a corner as they were still clearing away after breakfast.  Whilst eating the cleaner progressed with a noisy vacuum cleaner across the breakfast area and then arrived at the corner we were seated at.  She proceeded to vacuum around our table and even under our feet whilst we ate!  We booked the hotel because the car park had EV points.  I know they could not guarantee one would be available but we found none of the 3 points usable and had to go to a local supermarket and sit for an hour to recharge. We did not have breakfast as the lunch we had the day before was most unappetising. Inferior ingredients and tasteless.","

Would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel.
"," 9.0 ","The location is excellent. Within easy walking distance to restaurants and pubs and The Fleece where we had booked to see a show. Very good breakfast included in the price.","Finding the place was a bit of a nightmare but, to be fair this was aggravated by all the construction work going on in the area. To my mind the car parking charge of £20 per 24 hours is a bit of a liberty. Although the breakfast was first-class the organisation was a bit chaotic.","

Overall a positive experience, spoiled only by inattentive breakfast staff
"," 7.0 ","The check-in and check-out were very smooth and the gentlemen on reception was extremely helpful and efficient. Room was perfect for what I needed, very clean and comfortable, and the location of the hotel was perfect for my needs. Car parking was also very handy and worked well.","Long wait to get a table for breakfast - not because of the lack of tables, but because there was nobody there to attend to the waiting guests. Empty tables were not being cleared and re-set, so when someone did finally take me to a table, I had to wait again while the table was cleared and re-set. The person doing that did not seem to recognise that a lot of people were waiting and did not seem to be in a hurry to get fresh tables ready. For a hotel of this category, I would have expected a lot more.","

Convenient and comfortable. A good overnight stop.
"," 9.0 ","The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel itself was smart and quite conveniently located for walking to the old town. Breakfast was decent, if unexceptional and the price was good. A good option for an overnight stay in Bristol","The hotel could have provided much more helpful information in advance:
1) Access to the hotel by car is complicated (not helped by road works/construction and Google maps thinking you can turn left off Temple Gate where you can't). Last time I stayed in Bristol, the hotel provided detailed driving directions for accessing it from various different directions - something similar would have been helpful.
2) The only information I had from the hotel about parking talked about an option for £20 a day. They omitted to mention the alternative car park 20 seconds walk away that is free overnight, and £2.50 an hour for up to 4 hours. The staff mentioned it, but only when I asked about alternatives if the hotel car park was full.","

Room was spacious bed was comfortable.","It wasn't as modern as would have expected for a Hilton; there was a huge stain on the upholstered desk chair; stains all over the carpets and curtains too. Tea tray was okay but not exciting with no biscuits or fresh milk considering there was a fridge. And I hated having just a QR code for hotel information rather than some paper I could read and keep refer back to. TV half the channels didn't even work and guide was awful.","

Friendly and Polite staff with an excellent welcome factor.
"," 7.0 ","Good size room and excellent facilities, very comfortable bed.
Ideal location as I travelled by train and the venue for my function was only 5 minutes walk. Not so good walking back late night through the park opposite as there was a distinctive smell of cannabis, would have taken a different route if known but the times we live in, I guess.","I felt that the price was high as the hotel only really compared to other cheaper chain hotels. Yes, the restaurant was better but was only used it for a quick buffet breakfast as I was in Bristol for a function.
Speaking with other people met at the function I would look elsewhere if visiting Bristol again as they appeared to get a better deal financially.","

In the end I had to drop my wife off to go to the hotel on foot and then make 2 turnings that I was not supposed to make. On arrival it was explained that I should have gone through the archaway marked ""Novotel Car Park Only"". Easier access and plentiful, clear direction signs need to be provided. Parking was difficult due to the limited spaces in the hotel, so I had to park in the council car park and then pay a charge by 8am next morning, until a space became available in the hotel car park (£20 for 24 hours).

We arrived at Bristol by train, and it took us about 5~7 minutes to walk to the hotel (with our heavy luggage behind). We didn't try the breakfast, but we had dinner at the hotel restaurant. The atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant, and the food is good (we ordered some hot soup, salad, and Buffalo wings). I would like to compliment the ones who cleaned our room for treating my plushie with care.","The room is small, but with this affordable price, it's good enough.

Better than expected stay & good value off-weekend
"," 9.0 ","The staff at checkin were very friendly, and gave me a room that I asked for facing the garden. Thus my room was nice and quiet, with negligible from traffic noise until after 7am. The bed is comfortable and it's great to have both a kettle and a mini fridge. The included breakfast was very good, with nicely cooked poached eggs to order. The location is very convenient both for the railway station but also lovely walks along the Harbour area.","Only tiny things were an annoyance: even when off there is a low hum from the air conditioning and the room could do with more plugs at the bedside for charging phones and other equipment. Finally, it would be nice to have a better assortment of herbal tea bags, such as chamomile and peppermint, rather than predominantly regular tea","

Great hotel for a city break.
"," 9.0 ","The location was a 5 minute walk from the railway station. Pedestrian friendly. Check-in was speedy and efficient. A special mention for Nikita who checked us in and was more then helpful with the choice of room. The hotel was 10minutes walk away form the Old Town. Lots of history and great bars and eateries. So much to choose from. Breakfast was self service and plentiful with a good selection of food. Our room was small but very comfortable.","More Tea Bags in the room.","

Outstanding staff, thank you everyone. Owners could invest in some renovations
"," 9.0 ","The staff was the best thing about the location. Everyone was so accommodating and friendly. Peter stood out, he’s a manager or boss or something, and he’s leading by example. Also, the food was outstanding. The chicken and rice dish was amazing, don’t remember the name of it.","Not to be attributed to the staff, but the hotel could use some renovations. I imagine that’s up to the owners. There’s a particular smell throughout the hallway, but the room was excellent and clean. The furniture is not amazing, as it’s a bit older, but the cleaning staff did their job very well.","

Simply great
"," 8.0 ","Friendly staff, although the chef at breakfast came across a little bit annoyed when I made a small and honest mistake like I’m some sort of child. Seems like a nice guy though, but he could have handled that better.
The hotel was close to the station which makes it easy to get to another place and back. The location is nice and the price is the best amongst all competition. 
The breakfast was nice, lots of options, but in my opinion also a bit simple. 
All in all it’s very much worth your money, I’ve enjoyed it very much staying there. If you are just looking for a nice and easy place to stay, this is a great option. But if you want to make your stay a bit more special, maybe go for another hotel.","It’s a little bit of an old hotel, not really modern. Could be charming but you don’t expect it at Hilton’s.","

Great location and lovely staff
"," 8.0 ","Friendly staff, fridge in room, powerful shower, good location","Noise levels from other guests, bathroom too small to dry yourself so had to go into bedroom to do that, too many chairs blocking the room which was fairly small. There was a cracked sink and peeling ceiling in the bathroom. A better variety of tea and coffee making facilities would have been nice for the price. It was very basic and the one teabag I did use tasted like it was very old. The cooked breakfast was not good and the berry juice I had was incredibly sugary. More fresh options would have been better it all felt very cheap on the breakfast front which was a shame as the staff were very nice there","

Beautiful hotel with friendly and helpful staff
"," 8.0 ","Beautiful hotel, smart and clean with good parking facilities. 
Gentleman on reception was amazing and helpful, wish I could remember his name.
Went out of his way to help me with my daughter's graduation.","One of the rooms I was given was right next to the lift (didn't get this room until after 9pm) and it was not until my younger daughter had got undressed and ready for bed and switched the air conditioning off that I realised you could hear the lift.  It did keep me awake most of the night, but as my daughter was asleep I couldn't wake her up to move.  I had asked for quiet rooms away from the lifts and stairs (I had two rooms).
Also no tomatoes at breakfast, although everything else was good.","

Very nice location and enjoyable stay in Bristol
"," 8.0 ","The staff were very helpful. Rooms were clean. Location was quiet. The breakfast was good with a nice selection. 
It is easy to walk to the city centre & river. Car parking was useful albeit limited spaces & £20:00 fee for 24 hours..  Bristol is a very interesting city to visit. We enjoyed our brief stay.  
We would recommend this hotel.","Due to developments in the area, there are a number of diversions. I found it quite tricky getting to the car park, the SAT NAV kept asking to to turn down NO ENTRY roads !   There are trees that overhang the car park. In the summer these deposit sticky sap - so be be prepared to give your car a good wash when you get home! That is a minor point, not intended to be negative regarding the quality of this hotel.","

Comfortable stay but access not straightforward
"," 7.0 ","Room was compact but sufficient for a one night stay. Handy for the city centre and train station.
Breakfast was all self-service and plentiful.","Difficult to access by car as the postcode/satnav just leaves you on the main road from where the hotel is not accessible. It's necessary to arrive via the backstreets from where it is not signposted and all complicated by building works in the neighbourhood leading to road closures. Only after booking did I receive a message saying that there was limited parking at the hotel on a first come first served basis and that it would cost £20, which wasn't apparent when booking. Stayed on a Sunday night, so fortunately did get a space at the hotel.","

Fresh, Clean, Superb Stay for a Singleton!

Coffee bar in bedroom was nice with quiet boiling kettle. Desk and chair were great. Breakfast was lovely--easy instructions to use the waffle maker, which tables were vacant/occupied and where to get drinks. Surrounded by office buildings (quiet on weekends but gave a professional vibe).","Could have been more fresh fruit available at breakfast. Elevator chimer bell could have been turned off or on silent during the night (like 23:00-7:00) as rooms near the elevator could hear the elevator bell during those times.

Good hotel but noisy location and poor A/C
"," 8.0 ","Clean, modern and tidy. Car parking outside. Nice bar, food and a quiet outdoor verandah to enjoy a drink on rattan sofas. Service was excellent.","Too near a busy main road and traffic noise from 4am even with windows shut. Rear rooms are available though. A/C was poor, the controller didn’t work as per the instructions and the fan noise was on and off all night and the room cooled a little but it was stuffy. Uncomfortable sleep.
It’s not really near a good choice of restaurants or bars and a taxi is required.
The extra service charge added to restaurant service.","

Overnight in Bristol.
"," 8.0 ","This is a good business hotel in the developing area of the city towards Temple Meads. We chose the Hilton Garden rather than our usual Hilton Double Tree on the basis of a free breakfast and a room upgrade. The breakfast was fine. I think the room upgrade consisted of a larger bed in a normal sized room, and as a result we found the room and bathroom a bit cramped compared with the Hilton Doubletree which is an older hotel. But overall it was a good place to stay. The outlook from the restaurant, over the Temple Gardens, was particularly pleasant.","Our room, at the from of the hotel, faced onto the dual carriageway Temple Way and traffic noise was noticeable at certain times.","

Great hotel.

Everything was almost perfect, but there was one problem.","The room door was annoying because it didn't open the door easily.

Clean modern and well situated. All good apart from the parking confusion.
"," 8.0 ","The location was good. It was a short walk to the river and some of the central spots. 
Clean and modern room. Friendly staff. Breakfast was a good selection and included in the price.","Confusion about the parking. We knew spaces were limited and first-come-first-serve, however my friend arrived first and was reassured that we could park on the yellow hatch marked boxes up against the building if no spaces were available. 
I arrived and parked in one of those yellow boxes, however when I double checked this at check-in, the staff member I spoke to said this was not allowed due to a recent change of policy. She told me I would have to move the car and gave some poor advice about other local car parks (one of them only allowed 4-hour slots whereas I was staying for 48 hours and the other one required pre-booking and had no availability). I asked why several other cars were parked in the boxes and received a vague answer that they were guests who were checking out, however this was 5.30pm and I also noted that there were at least 2 different cars parked in the yellow boxes at any point during my stay. Ultimately I managed to grab a proper space (quite expensive at £20 per night) but it all made for a frustrating and flustering start to the stay. 
I should mention that my friend was also told that the disabled bays were fine to use if nothing else was available but I would not have felt comfortable to do that.","

Not bad for a few days in Bristol
"," 8.0 ","First of all, let me give a shout-out to the extremely helpful hotel personnel who went out of their way to make our stay problem-free. Thank you.
Staying on the positive side, the location of the hotel is great, it is located a few minutes from shopping centres, not too far from nice attractions. And Bristol is a very nice city.","The room was small and heating was not adequate, so an electric heater was provided which had a tendency to overheat when we used it full on.
During early morning I was able to sit in the bar and work, though the wall sockets did not have power.","

Excellent Hotel, Amazing Staff
"," 9.0 ","The staff were very friendly and courteous and could not do enough for you, from the reception to restaurant to chamber maids, all were amazing. Before we arrived, I asked for an early check-in due to getting to Bristol very early that morning. A note was put on the system. On arrival, no rooms were available, which was very understandable, but we were told to go into the restaurant and grab a coffee or some food while we where waiting , to me, this was a really nice gesture to arriving guests.. 
Then we were told our room was ready, we were in our room around 11.30/12.00 ... the hotel could do no wrong, the whole hotel is kept very clean and all staff are an absolute credit to the hilton group, If we return to Bristol I know exactly where we will be staying ' The Hilton Garden Inn'","Nothing..","

Good hotel facilities, rude staff
"," 7.0 ","The hotel was what you would expect from a Hilton sunchain. Clean, unspectacular. Good location. Room was a good size and showers were great.","I lost my debit card in the week leading up to my stay. Advised by booking.com to update card prior to the stay. The hotel took a payment of about £1 to check the card.
I went to check in where we were greated by a member of staff who was somewhat nonplusssed that we were there. In fairness she had checked another couple in just prior. There were other customers at the desk.
I was asked for my details. The receptionist, within earshot of my parter and other customers, mentioned that my card was declined earlier in the week, in a tone and demeanour which was not friendly. I explained that I had put a new card on file which the hotel had taken money from. The fact this was said in earshot of others was quite emabarrasing.
I checked in. Nipped downstairs shortly after and took a can of soft drink from the fridge in reception. As soon as I took the can out, another member of staff approached me asking if I intended to pay for it. This happened within a split second of me removing said can from the fridge. This leads me to believe that something may have been mentioned re: the declined card, as if I had been profiled. I advised the member of staff that I had intended to pay for this. I put the can in the fridge as I felt embarrased and purchased from the bar instead, from that member of staff, to save any awkwardness in regards to the fridge.
I went to reception the next morning having slept on this. A male receptionist was on at this point. I recounted yesterdays issues with him, only to be informed that they always challenge people using the fridge as people assume it is free (it clearly isnt, the price list is visible). He seemed exasperated to even consider dealing with my complaint. There was no apology or anything.
I felt as though I was being looked down","

very good location and good staff, shame about the room and size.
"," 7.0 ","The property is in a very good location, with easy access to the city centre and train station. Views over the gardens are good and the location is perfect for a “car free” visit to Bristol. The entrance and fragrance in the reception area is exceptional and the staff were very friendly.","The rooms are simply not big enough for the price being demanded, in addition the mattress was very uncomfortable to sleep on and the bed creaked and cracked with every movement on it (a person who weighs less than 80kg) this made for a very disruptive nights sleep. The in room facilities although adequate do not reflect what I would’ve expected from a Hilton brand hotel. The wash/bathroom is tiny with very little room to move in and the shower again was very small.","

"," 9.0 ","","I had specifically asked for some gin to be delivered on the 2nd night of our stay (as my friend's special anniversary) but sadly they had put it out on the first night so when we arrived it was already sitting there, very nice, but on the wrong day.  I told a member of staff at Reception and he said what would he like me to do and I half-heartedly said 'Another would be nice on the actual day of celebration tomorrow night!' He said fine - which was a mistake as it did not appear the next evening. He should not have agreed without asking his supervisor probably.

Sort out the car parking - just saying it is very limited is not at all helpful!
"," 7.0 ","Very helpful staff, hotel was clean, well maintained and comfortable.","Ridiculous system with the car parking - not nearly enough car parking spaces - said first come first served but this caused me considerable distress not knowing whether I could access a car parking space and no idea where else I could park because there was no offer of other information or signage.  There was more room in the tiny car park to create more spaces but the owner has not bothered to think about the basic needs of its customers.  Put me off staying there.  I gave it a good as the female receptionist on duty very kindly allowed me to park in an unused disabled car park which I really appreciated her for her initiative for a system that was not her fault.","

Forget about the breakfast. I would stay here again
"," 7.0 ","The hotel is very well located to the city. Being on the main road the room was very quite and had a wonderful sleep, Infact, it was so quite I often over slept. The staff on the front desk we good to chat with but the staff within the breakfast area, well, let not say anything yet","Let's take Breakfast. I didn't book breakfast for not sure what hours I'd be working but the rate that Booking.com told me I'd pay on the day was different from what they were going to charge me. Between the hotel and booking.com they got it sorted. Always print things off. The staff in the breakfast area never made contact. Not even a good morning. They were very quick at clearing the tables  even if you had food on your plate and gone to get another coffee. When I returned my table and food had been cleared. They were just not interested in the job.","

Very relaxing stay within easy walk of town centre.
"," 8.0 ","We were on the 5th floor. Even though the room was an the ""road"" side (i.e. not garden view), it was very quiet. This was the weekend of the boat festival - it was actually quite nice NOT to be in the centre of the action - but close enough to walk without problems. The aircon worked well and kept the room cool even when very hot outside. Very comfy pillows. Didn't try the restaurant. Staff helpful - in the absence of a concierge service, the desk staff were able to advise on a good bakery, and an easy way to get to Cathedral Walk.","I still think the price was a tad high; we chose it because everywhere else anywhere near the centre was equally expensive - could have gone out of town, but then would have incurred taxi fares.","

We had breakfast in the churchyard opposite the hotel, on a bench beneat the trees. It was wonderful.","Big windows but only one of them opened (and barely at that), and air conditioning that is not as powerful as it needs to be when windows don't open. No hotel stationery (paper or pens). Good selection of teas and coffees, including decaffineated options.","

Despite the negatives, I enjoyed my short stay and would recommend.
"," 8.0 ","Location was good, within walking distance to the train station and local attractions. Room was perfect size. Staff were welcoming and friendly at all times. I went out into the local area for the morning and came back to a freshly made bed and everything had been restocked in the room.","I felt like I was on Four in a Bed doing the room inspections, haha! The room I stayed in had dust lying around (on bed headboard, bedroom sides, areas in the shower room). The shower room was a bit small but that could just be my personal preference. The shower head was dripping despite being turned off. One of the clean hand towels had dirt on. The main light didn't work and neither did one of the plug sockets.","

Now that I know how to access the car park, this is a great place to stay.
"," 9.0 ","Very comfortable hotel situated in exactly the right place for our requirements.","Finding and getting into the car park was a nightmare.
Our satnav took us almost to the hotel but then I had to ask directions. I followed those and as I drove I could see the front of the hotel but with no apparent access for a car. I eventually parked and went into a Novotel hotel to ask for directions. Although the staff were helpful they were unable to give me exact directions. So, I walked around the block to the Hilton Garden Inn where the receptionist explained that I had to drive through an archway, which was clearly marked 'Novotel Hotel', and follow the road to the rear of the Garden Inn Hotel. Quite ridiculous!
I could find no mention of this when I re-read everything on my confirmation email. Surely something as fundamental as this should be stated prominently on both booking.com and the hotel website?
Also, the hotel charges £16 per day for parking. I don't remember reading that on the website.
For any potential guests who might read this review, you should be aware that there are a few spaces in the lane behind the hotel (200 yards from the rear entrance to the hotel) where parking costs are about £5 a day. Not exactly secure but if, like me you object to rip-off parking then this might be an option.","

The staff is very gracious and helpful and the breakfast was a good deal and plentiful.
"," 8.0 ","The hotel is very conveniently located to the train station, the harbor area and the Cabot Circus shopping area; all within walking distance and a bus stop for the number 8 bus is right outside and goes around the main harbor area and up to Clifton Park and the zoo.

Overall - the room was exactly what I needed and the staff were very friendly. No issues at all.
"," 8.0 ","Woman who checked me in was very nice, very accommodating, and found me an available room to check into at 11am, despite check in technically being at 3pm. That was great.
She also helped with getting the 2nd room key to my friend who was arriving later. She gave me all the necessary details around breakfast etc,","Difficult to say the price was great. I originally booked for just myself which was £140 for just me for one night. I then swapped to 2 single beds so my friend could join & the price stayed the same, and I saved money by splitting the cost. 
Ideally single people shouldn't be penalised for not having a partner, and booking for just 1 person should be cheaper than booking for 2.","

Will definitely go again, but only if a proper disabled room with twin beds is available
"," 8.0 ","Very clear (and necessary) directions given to the hotel and the adjoining car park.  Superb location for easy walking access to the city centre and docks.  Excellent wheelchair access for my wife's wheelchair.  The staff at reception and in the restaurant were so helpful,  above and beyond expectations.  Good atmosphere with the staff.  Given thorough instructions for disabled exit in the event of an emergency. Lobby, waiting area, restaurant all on one ground floor level.  Beds were very good, we both slept really well, much better than at home.  Plenty of eating places to suit all tastes within 10 mins walk of the hotel.","We needed twin beds due to my wife's disability.  The only disabled rooms with twin beds were not full spec for disabled, so the room was too narrow, and no seat in the shower and insufficient handholds.  The full spec disabled rooms only had double beds.  I  spoke to the manager, who was so helpful, efficient and friendly in all matters, who said he would recommend to your GM to adapt one of these rooms for twin beds.  No biscuits in the room!  Food in the restaurant was good but not excellent.  The scrambled eggs were outstanding one morning and quite awful on the next day.  Coffee machine troublesome..","

Perfect stay would return again and again
"," 9.0 ","Second stay within this hotel this year. I’d return again and again when coming to Bristol. Good location short Uber to everything you need. Rooms are all very modern and both stays we’ve had no complaints with either room both different to eachother. All very clean. Nice area downstairs where you can eat ; drink or just grab a small snack. All staff friendly throughout the stay. Gym downstairs which I didn’t go in but had a peek and it seems alright. Highly recommend","Room had a view of a scary looking abandoned car park which was a little unsettling but just kept the curtain closed , didn’t expect much of a view in Bristol city centre anyway","

One of the best chain hotels I have stayed in for room facilities, and cleanliness.

The room was immaculately clean, very well laid out with plenty of storage. Having a fridge was a real benefit for milk and cold drinks. 
Although compact the bathroom had a good sized shower. I was delighted to see that there was magnifying mirror installed, and the heated mirror was a great feature.
Breakfast was good and plentiful, but the evening meal was ok but nothing special.
Staff throughout were lovely.","The only thing that would prevent me from staying again is the fact that the bed was very uncomfortable for me. Too hard and very creaky. It is shame really as everything else was perfect.","

Restful
"," 9.0 ","My stay at the hotel was everything I expected to be and the staff were exceptional - Even though we arrived at 1040 for breakfast on the Saturday the choice and quality was far better than I expected and the experience and friendliness of the catering staff was a exceptional - A good kick start to a very full itinerary on that day.
HOWEVER
I telephoned a few days prior to the visit to correct an error in the booking and ask a question about parking - After a strange  delay in connection  my enquiry - which I considered to be perfectly valid - was dealt with in a less than courteous manner and I rang off with the unacceptable feeling of  'Why Did I Bother ? and that same error was present on my booking when I arrived - Yet the very nice lady at the reception corrected it with a smile and no hassle.
My actual stay was superb and my colleague was exceedingly pleased as well.","See above and in my particular room felt the bathroom was a little cramped but entirely functional - The tightness had obviously been experienced before as the toilet roll holder had received a knock or something before and was loose on the wall. - Plus i would have liked a better hook behind the door for my dressing gown.
Plus = Apart from a group of men that were very much into their cups at 3am on the Sunday morning and who decided to discuss when they should meet the next day outside my door {But this was not the fault of the hotel and well beyond their care} - Overall I was very impressed with the quietness in the room and we both slept extremely well","

Exceeded my expectations, would stay again!
"," 8.0 ","Was very impressed with this hotel. For the price of the room I wasn’t expecting amazing things, however upon arrival I was very surprised. I was immediately greeted with a very clean lobby and friendly reception staff. The room we had was on the top floor which meant a lovely view, the room was very large, clean and well presented. To show that nobody had been in the room after housekeeping, stickers were placed over the doors which I think is a brilliant idea considering covid circumstances ect. There was also a mini fridge in the room which was a delight!  Definitely worth the money!! We also tried out the bar and had some food which was delicious. The servers were incredibly polite and everything was priced very fairly for the quality!! The hotel itself is a 5 minute walk from the train station and was in a perfect location!","","

Bristol is a great city, and the hotel met all of our requirements.
"," 9.0 ","The hotel is close to the station, and just a 5 or 10 minute walk to the central areas. First impressions are that the hotel is smart, bright, clean and business-like. Staff were welcoming and helpful. Rooms were a decent size and comfortable, self-service breakfasts were of good quality with plenty of choice.","The design and decor is conservative, nothing special, but that is purely a matter of personal taste, and I have no criticisms.","

Lovely hotel in great position
"," 8.0 ","Hotel is in an excellent position a short walk from the river and man attractions. It has the added bonus of on site parking for £16 a day, which runs from the time that you hack in, so we were able to leave the car there after check out while we went out for dine lunch.  (Worth noting when you are thinking about the time to arrive) 
Staff were friendly and helpful, single beds comfortable and a decent size and it’s really nice to stay somewhere that allows you to leave the hectic main City behind after a days site seeing. Loads of great bars and restaurants in walking distance and a quiet tranquil park opposite the hotel. 
Highly recommended.","The air con wasn’t working and even though we reported it, no one came to fix it. It did leave the room a bit uncomfortable at night but not enough to stop us returning another time.","

I have stayed in this hotel several times, but will probably not return.
"," 4.0 ","The location is excellent, but the car park is limited and expensive. There should be reference to a cheaper car park on the other side of the hotel. The breakfast was excellent, but otherwise the food menu is limited, portions are smaller than before and quite expensive. Last orders in the restaurant and for room service is at 9.30 pm and food service closes at 10 pm. For early departures, there are no breakfast options. The restaurant gets over-crowded and busy with groups travelling. Other customers at the hotel must sit and eat in the small bar section with a wide screen mostly on sports (soccer) channels.","I had booked a room with king-size bed, fridge, laptop safe and balcony. There are no rooms with balcony and also got a room on the noisy street side, not park side. There was a small safe, but no laptop safe and no fridge. The room cost also included bathrobe and slippers that were not in the room and were not provided by the hotel. The management blamed Booking com and agreed to refund only £20 per night. No refund for not having breakfast upon early departure. The manager of the reception, Peter was rather rude and inattentive. This has happened before, too, when my restaurant meals were charged to my room although I paid for the in the restaurant. That led to a long exchange with the hotel to sort out the overcharges..","

Breakfast options were good, as were the timings (until 11am at the weekend, which gives you the chance of a lovely lie-in without missing it!)","My room felt dark and cramped - sitting on the loo, the toilet roll holder was poking my arm, and I am of average size! There were stains on the carpets and the TV remote control only worked some of the time. 
No instructions were given on check-in about breakfast (which was included in my room rate), and when I went down in the morning there were no staff at the breakfast buffet and I had to go and ask at reception, where they weren't particularly polite.

Staff were all very pleasant and accommodating.","The room was quite 'corporate' and devoid of character. And it felt quite cramped. Coffee/Tea provisions were miserly. Only one towel was in the bathroom though luckily we found another in the wardrobe. Initially we were allocated a twin room despite having booked a king bed, which meant having to traipse back down to reception to have it resolved - which it was. Car parking is quite pricey and feels it's exploiting the fact it is onsite -I guess cheaper alternatives are a short walk away. Biggest disappointment was the cooked breakfast buffet in the morning - undercooked tomatoes (how the?), leathery bacon, anaemic(!) tasteless sausages, rubbery(!) scrambled eggs. It was truly dreadful. I wished I'd chosen continental. (Note - we did find out that you can order eggs any way you want but would have been helpful to know when we entered).","

Really appreciated being able to leave my bag after checking out, and to pick it up after my day's work.","The chair for the desk in my room seemed to some water stains on the seat which made it feel a bit shabby compared to the high standard elsewhere.","

Great location but poor hotel
"," 3.0 ","Location is great here, bus stop directly outside the entrance of hotel, trains station and city centre a few minutes walk. Breakfast had a good selection of food and drinks and was overall quite tasty.","Our first room, had a whole in the ceiling and side of arm chairs had been ripped off as well as our aircon not working at all. Our 2nd room - aircon would work by blowing out air however temp control stated ‘failure’ and wold not heat up so we were cold all night. The beds are only a double and ridiculously uncomfortable. The mattress if not firm but rock solid. The pillows although they look fluffy squash down to virtually flat. Very basic and minimalistic room. For the name, I expected more for my money.","

We had a squeaky bed and a fousty smell wafting through the room which we think was from the air vents.

Good selection at breakfast.","The hotel has not dealt with my complaint in relation to noise during my stay.  We were told a week prior to our stay the restaurant would be closed to a private function. Not an issue as planned to eat in the city but the hotel placed us on floors one and three with no consideration of the noise we would experience from the function until gone midnight both nights. It's a shame as the hotel was perfect for location and somewhere I would like to stay again had they acknowledged our concerns better. It was clean and the bed were comfy, my only concern was the noise from the functions. However I'm reluctant to return due to the poor customer service from the reception staff and management. The hotel had five floors.I think they could have considered putting us higher up to avoid the noise and away from.guests staying for the function as we had a lot of slammed doors and shouting until gone midnight both nights. Also they could have reminders around hotel for guests to be respectful to other guests staying at the hotel. The room also had poor lighting and were quite dark in the bedroom area.","

"," 2.0 ","It was close to the train station","I was put in a room on the first floor near the front of the hotel and I could hear people chatting while smoking in front of the hotel like they were in my room. The hotel was very noisy. I was then sent to a room on the 5th floor with a leak in the shower and the heater was broken. The heaters in both rooms were very very noisy, the noise was worse than if a car was in the room and in the new room it did not even work. I had to go to the front desk and they gave me a space heater. No heater in the middle of winter is unacceptable for a room at 200 euros a night. Moreover the remote for the TV did not work. Unfortunately, I cannot add the video here to show what it was like.
The pictures on booking and the reality in the hotel are very different. The furniture are old and the carpet is very old.","

"," 5.0 ","Good location and car parking (albeit £20!), friendly staff","Just tired and worn out hotel, in need of a refresh. Aircon didn’t work in the room, staff was helpful and got me into another room with working aircon which was more comfortable- but old fashioned dial rather than being able to set the temperature. Noisy near the main road, could do with better sound insulation and bed wasn’t very comfortable or supportive. Just all seemed very old fashioned and not worth the money spent,","

Hot and stuffy room and unprofessional male receptionist let down an otherwise nice hotel.
"," 2.0 ","Clean room, good shower, comfy beds","The room was so stuffy and sweltering despite it being cool outside in October and the window only opened a tiny amount. The air conditioning was useless and very noisy - we came home a night early as both were recovering from colds so we were already blocked up.
The worse part overall was the reaction of the male grey haired receptionist with glasses.
 On the morning of our second day we decided to go home early so I went to reception only to hand in the room cards and check out. I wasn't expecting any refund and didn't really want to explain anything and we were so tired we just wanted to get home.
After making me wait for a few minutes until he served me (unapologetically) while he did some admin from the previous guest, I pleasantly said I just wanted to check out and handed him the cards.
He looked at his  screen and said ""but you're staying for 2 nights"" - I explained that we weren't feeling good and that the room had been unbearable hot and stuffy so we had had a bad night and just wanted to go home.
he replies ""Well, you'll have to pay for the second night"" without making eye contact staring at his computer.
I'd already paid for the stay when I checked in and hadn't even mentioned not paying for the second night.
 I was so taken aback and foggy headed that I just said ""I've already paid"" and he handed me the card of the manager in case we wanted a refund.
I was amazed at his response and in hindsight I wish I had been more on the ball. Rather than saying something like, ""Im sorry to hear that"" / ""maybe we can move you to a cooler room or ""did you try the air conditioning?
I came away feeling as if we were treated like we were not worthy to be staying there and were trying something on, not like a valued guest at all.  This member of staff needs some customer service refresher training, or perhaps a new job where he isn't dealing with customers.","

Passable
"," 5.0 ","Friendly staff","1)Being charged £20 for parking. The initial email received a few minutes after booking said £16, I contacted the hotel to ask about blue badge parking because my friend has mobility issues. Was told they have 3 but it is on a first come first served basis. (and incidently, those three spaces are quite far from the entrance/reception area - far from ideal. )
2) Difficult to find. The hotel is easy to see from Temple Way, but finding the entrance to the car park/hotel entrance was difficult. It is poorly signposted and a bit of a nightmare.
3) The hotel accommodation is average. We booked a room with a king-size bed and there was very little room to move around the bed, the room felt very small. The room description mentions an ergodynamic chair, which was the only chair in the room and quite uncomfortable..  The furniture hasn't been updated for a while. Bed side sockets could be more accessible. 
Don't be deceived  by the ""Hilton"" name, this feels like an inferior budget hotel, and what you save on the so called free breakfadt in the room description is taken off you in parking fees.","

Also a list of things on offer  so poached eggs vegan sausages etc we had to ask. Prunes would be a welcomed addition to the fresh fruit range.
Double checking room to make sure that the room service menu is actually in there.Ours was not.A map of Bristol in the room or on offer at reception would be great as well. And where was the Gideon bible ?????","

Great value for money, convenient for public transport and exceeded my expectations in every way.
"," 10 ","I was pleasantly surprised with everything about the hotel. i chose it based on price and location, which was perfect as  was using public transport for a week of visiting family and friends. I have travelled a fair bit during the past year and hotel prices have been ludicrously high in most places.
Everything, the staff, the comfortable bed, soundproofing from outside noise, breakfast, etc,etc. made my stay really enjoyable at a reasonable price. I was staying alone so maybe the room I had may be small for 2 people, but I would still recommend booking here.","No criticism.","

So I was made to back to room to bring my phone and show proof of the breakfast!

Had a pleasant stay and would definitely stay there if we visit Bristol again.
"," 10 ","Located at a very convenient and quite part of the town. Very comfortable room with plenty of space and clean. Very nice restaurant and bar, foods were really good. 
Breakfast was plentiful and the good thing is that breakfast was laid out in different part ie. main breakfast in one corner, pastries drinks & coffee in other area so it avoided crowding in one place everyone queuing in most of the other hotels.","Couple bottles of mineral water in room would have been nice.","

"," 6.0 ","The breakfast was very nice, the staff all very friendly and polite. very handy for the city centre. i liked the provision of a fridge","empty toiletry bottles, broken pump on toiletry bottle, Showerhead was full of limescale. Quite a small room and even smaller bathroom this considering i was 'upgraded' to a King room, too small, and once the luggage bags where in, no room to pass the bed. When i booked i was offered a city view, i actually received a main road and a large overgrown tree view it was very very noisy all throughout the night. The desk chair provided was heavily stained, no complimentary biscuits with the coffee and tea. and finally i thought the charge of £20 to park my car, as a guest, on site was a little extortionate.","

Really, really good for a chain hotel, felt very good value for money
"," 10 ","Great location in a quieter part of the city centre.  Room spacious enough for a 2-night stay, and spotlessly clean.  Bar and restaurant area bright and open.  Nice little outside terrace for evening drinks.  Great breakfast.  And, what really sets is apart, very happy and friendly staff throughout.","Parking relatively limited, though there is a public car park just up the road.","

Building Site
"," 2.0 ","The reception staff were very welcoming on our arrival and gave great information on various sites in Bristol.","Where do I start? I booked a room with a city view and despite 75% of the Hotel having this I was given a room facing a building site and awoke to find 3 builders directly opposite my window hammering scaffolding together! The mattress was too hars and the pilliwa had no support whatsoever leading to a night of very patchy sleep. Breakfast was barely lukewarm and the bacon was almost raw. So disappointing to have paid for something that was not delivered. Some kind of recompense is definitely in order, I would never use Hilton again!","

A far cry from what I expected from the 'Hilton' brand.
"," 2.0 ","I was compensated, with a free meal, for the various mistakes made by the hotel reception staff.","When I arrived, I was told my booking did not include breakfast (which I had booked). Desiring breakfast, I was asked to pay there and then. Fine. But the card machine was broken. So I paid in cash and was told it would be taken off may bill when I checked out.
When I ate in the restaurant that evening with my colleague, for which we asked to be billed separately, they billed us incorrectly - the billed my colleague for everything. So we had to pend 10 minutes sorting this out on checkout next morning. Also during checkout, I was told (by a different staff member) that I had overpaid for breakfast because my original booking did in fact include breakfast. Again this cost about 5 minutes of checkout time.
In all, the reception experience was really dire. Nobody seemed to know what they were doing ir why mistakes had been made. As I said, this was helped by the removal of charge for my evening meal.
However, my morning at the Hilton had already been tarnished by a rude breakfast chef. Still tired, I stood at the counter playing some hot items on my plate, when out of nowhere I was barred at by the chef for not putting the bacon tongs on a special resting plate in front of the tray. I had in fact picked up the tongs from where I;d left them, in the tray. I was taken aback by this rudeness - how are guests supposed to know this detail? the chef was doing nothing else than watch people do this over again. He could have replaced the tongs himself, or at least said 'good morning' first and perhaps 'sorry, sir, would you mind leaving the tongs on the plate in front"".
When I made it clear that I was put out by his conduct, he started arguing with me, about how I should do what I was told. Really ridiculous. It raised stress levels that I really didn't need to be raised and is so easily avoidable.
In short, the staff experience during my stay was pretty poor - either through basic incompetence or rudeness.","

Uncomfortable beds and too hot
"," 6.0 ","Good location with easy access to many attractions.
There was less traffic noise than I was expecting.","The man on the front desk was a bit snippy, if I'm honest. Yes we checked in 20 minutes early but he could have dropped the attitude. 
The rooms were far too hot and the bed was uncomfortable.
The showerhead holder was held together with glue and wasn't secure, so kept falling on me.
Overall, a very average hotel.","

Stay Elsewhere
"," 5.0 ","Located in the centre of Bristol, which met my needs as i had a meeting nearby.","First of all don't be taken in by booking.com offering a free upgrade, as all the rooms are exactly the same, and the bathrooms are tiny.
The location of the hotel is decent, but trying to get access to it was a nightmare, with the one way system, roads closed and excessive building work nearby.
The hotel itself was more like a Travelodge style, and something you don't really relate to, with the Hilton brand name.
And the cleaners need to have a word with themselves, as the bin in the bathroom was full of used sanitary products, which i presume was left by the previous occupant, and when i informed reception, all they said was ""sorry about that"" and wasn't interested in the least.
The breakfast wasn't really for me, as I'm not a fan of buffet style breakfasts.","

Nice hotel but felt a bit disappointed with the experience overall. I wouldn’t rush back.
"," 5.0 ","The hotel is well located and smartly decorated.","The additional charge of £20 for parking for 24 hours was a bit excessive. We had to wait a fair amount of time to check in, as there were only two members of staff on the desk. The room we stayed in was decorated nicely and smart at first glance, but after spending some time in there, I noticed quite a few stains all over the carpet and a big stain on the curtains. Breakfast was another additional charge, which we had to wait another ten minutes for a table and the food was pretty standard.","

Although an accessible room was made available; the inside was furnished with carpet, making movement within the room more energy consuming; also there was a lip on the door frame, making it difficult to enter the room (chair tipping and opening a fire door is hard); and the initial room we were directed to had electrical issues (no plugs working).","

Disappointed
"," 3.0 ","very nice hotel in good position","restaurant was closed due to Christmas parties, no prior warning of this given. we were offered room service, which we ordered. 
food was great but had to sit on the bed to eat as no table, so was uncomfortable. 
no housekeeping done the following day so dirty dishes, wet towels and no tea making facilities replenished. 
when my husband spoke with receptionist to ask   for clean towels for next day sadly no apologies given just oh it’s not been done! 
a very nice cleaning lady hastily brought fresh towels and took tray of plates that had sat in our room all day with remaining leftovers, just relieved that we didn’t order fish.
All in all a very disappointing experience","

Air conditioning was so noisy it couldn’t be used at night despite 20 degree heat outside

Great hotel to visit
"," 10 ","Friendly service,  Annie and Jenny  on front desk were so kind and helpful.  Annie went over and  above to help us with accommodation for late arrival  of my son who needed 2 rooms for his family which made a difficult  situation easily  sorted out. Can't thank her enough also for giving  us ground  floor room as  my wife's  legs were bad and she doesn't  like lifts. Wonderful  experience all round and will definitely be  back on our next  visit to Bristol.  Lovely staff good breakfast EXCELLENT.","N/A","

Could have been better
"," 6.0 ","Staff were really pleasant and helpful.  Restaurant and bar area was lovely and breakfast was great.","Our room was an accessible room and felt a little snug.  Bed was small but comfortable.  Window led out onto the street making the room feel a little overlooked and the rubber seal around the window was loose and hanging.  The bathroom was brilliant - plenty of room with excellent facilities but the door would not close properly.  The ceiling especially, but also the walls and skirt boards were marked or scuffed, giving the room an overall tired feel.","

Travelodge and Premier Inn have family corridors and signage asking people to be considerate when coming in late. reception said that it was too difficult for the Hilton to arrange this. won’t be back. very disappointed. if you can’t sleep properly at a hotel it’s failed really hasn’t it?","

Enjoyed Bristol with the hotel being close to Temple Meads and the water ferry.
"," 6.0 ","Handy for Temple Meads and not too far to walk to the city centre. The hotel is clean and modern i.e. with the uniformity that goes with new-builds.","For the price I would have expected more space in the room and en-suite. The hotel is having problems with its supplier and many of the electronics don't work adequately - wi-fi and tv. Breakfast was buffet style and over-priced, with the lamp-warmers seemingly placed too high to adequately warm the food.","

I let the hotel know after the first night, they sent me a message to apologise and said they would keep an eye out the next night.  The 2nd night was worse.  Music and people in room next door, people in corridor shouting to try find their room because they couldn't find key or remember where they were staying, trying random doors, slamming doors.  I gave the feedback to the receptionist as I checked out and she apologised and says it wasn't within their control.  I beg to differ.  I have travelled at lot with work over the years and this was not acceptable; its your hotel, you make the rules.  You knew there was potential for disturbance and did not take responsibility.","

I felt extremely uncomfortable and unsafe. After telling the night staff, the noise stopped for about 30 minutes then commenced again at 4am. Myself and my friend in my twin room got no sleep.

A very nice, clean, comfortable hotel to spend a couple of nights in Bristol
"," 10 ","The room was surprisingly nice! I had not expected it to look so new and modern and it was impeccably clean. 
The bed was big and EXTREMELY comfortable - my partner has back issues and this mattress was one of the few during our trip that he felt at ease sleeping on. 
The place had plenty of mirrors for getting ready to go out for a night or for a walkabout in the morning. It also had a lot of storage available in the room. The hotel provided shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap, and body lotion (as per usual), but they smelled very nice and didn't feel cheap like so many often do. 
The wifi was very strong and we had no issues getting online. 
The room was very quiet. We didn't hear any of the other guests or anyone on the street outside during our stay despite only staying on the first floor. The view from the windows of the park across was nice, though best experienced in the day as not much could be seen at night. 
The hotel was very easy to navigate. 
Parking was very simple. We were able to get a 24-hour parking pass from the time of our arrival and keep the car in the small lot just in front of the hotel making our worries about leaving our car in a lot down the street unnecessary. The fee for the 24-hour stay was only £16, very affordable compared to the other park and pay options in the area. 
The staff were very helpful at check-in and check-out.","Nothing comes to mind - the stay was very pleasant and everything you would hope for from a night in a hotel in a new city. The only blip was with the parking fee. We thought we paid the fee at check-in but the clerk was a bit busy and must not have completed the transaction so we received a bill for parking in the morning after thinking that we had already paid for it. It was easily worked out at the front desk at checkout and the money had not been taken from our account. So it was a non-issue in the end.","

Turin Brakes Gig & Hotel Stay
"," 10 ","So I've actually stayed here before due to it's location & it's a really nice hotel hence why I returned.
The staff are all very pleasant, helpful & accommodating.
The room was lovely with the view, clean & tidy.
The bed was comfortable.
The other areas of the hotel are also very clean & tidy.
Breakfast was good & had a variety of either continental or cooked.
I'd stay here again without any hesitation in the future for sure.","","

Adequate were not at the hotel due to being out all day.
"," 6.0 ","The closeness to Temple Mead Station.  The room being ready before normal check in. The well trained staff.","The room was of adequate size but rather tired , stains to carpet, dressing table drawers falling to pieces so drawers did not shut. we had booked into the Recess bar /restaurant . we had looked at the on line  menu and the prices seemed reasonable although menu was not very extensive . We arrived for our 6.30 booking the the noise from a large group of drinkers was horrendous - not good when you suffer from tinnitus; the menu was even more reduced; the prices had gone up and the portions very small my husbands piece of fish was the size of a childs portion.  My Husband received a charge docket which he signed very surprised to find additional charges for service and and tips.  If there was a note on the menu re these charges it was that small it was missed.","

It´s a in a good location, short walk from the centre, nice and helpful staff.","The Rooms are outdate and in dire need of update, carpets were dirty, desk chair was old and tired, arm ripped and it would not hold it´s position. The room was dirty and could have used better cleaning.  Check out made us loose our train into London as the nightshift had refunded my payment and I was charged again in the morning.

Poor sleep on first of 2 nights.
"," 4.0 ","We went as to run a race the first of our two mornings.
However very disturbed sleep on our first of two nights.
TV in the next room was on full volume on our return at 11 pm.
Could never sleep through this, after 3 hours at 2 AM I phoned reception who then came quickly.
They entered the room 436 and muted the TV.
Ruined our rest and our run was nothing like we thought it would be,due to lack of sleep.
Everything else was great,but the main reason for our stay was to have a goodnight sleep for our run.
Room 434 was very nice, but why no porter to check floors? it was obvious to us in the corridor that TV was way too loud.
Why do TVs need such loud volume in a hotel?
A real shame as many lovely things to say of the hotel but our memories are all about our lack of sleep.","Alter maximum volume on TVs maybe then this could never have happened.","

This hotel does not deserve your custom .
"," 5.0 ","The room was a standard size, and the bathroom  had a good shower with good hot water. The room had a good wardrobe and storage space, which is a rarity. Breakfast, which I paid for includes in the price, was really good, including plant based options. The hotel restaurant had reasonable food. Small portions and some unreasonably expensive but others a good value for money. Restaurant/breakfast staff were really nice. The hotel fitness room was small and rather basic (i.e no barbells). The hotel is 10 mins from the train station and 10mins from the city centre. Although on a busy road I didn't find the room noisy, although truth be said I never have trouble sleeping!","The hotel has a ""no housekeeping "" policy at the moment. This meant I had to take my dirty mugs to reception and ask for clean mugs, my room was not hoovered during my stay, let alone the rest of the room tidied. To suggest this is because of ""COVID safety measures"" is an insult to your customers, considering that all the staff (including and particularly the housekeeping staff) are about their business without wearing masks and that there is no contact between the housekeeping staff and the guest during housekeeping. This is blunt cost cutting disguised as a COVID measure. When I challenged reception about this I was told that I had been misinformed (despite the fact I was given a written notice specifying no housekeeping will be done) housekeeping was available if booked the evening before...I don't know, perhaps the virus takes exception when it's told someone will do the room in advance? I'm not sure whether I'm more crosses about the lack of service or the insult of the hotel trying to pretend it's about COVID. And of course no harm will happen to me for not having housekeeping for a few days, but if I pay for a hotel it's because I want that extra pampering, otherwise, I book an Airbnb which is cheaper and where I do my own hoovering and pot washing. This hotel does not deserve your custom and your hard earned cash.","

Please avoid
"," 3.0 ","- Waffle machine for breakfast","Did feel COVID-unfriendly as there was someone self-isolating in the room just in front of us and every time we entered or left our room there were leftovers in the hallway: trash, food plates, you name it. I'm unsure if that person had tested positive or not, but surely if halfway through their stay they test positive the risks for other guests is quite high? Especially given that they were allowed to receive things outside of their room door by their friends/family/whomever and we even saw the self-isolating person inside the room with an open door chatting to the person that had just brought them something.
Other things that made the stay subpar:
 - Not in the city centre
- Bathroom was *extremely* small. Two people cannot stand up in that bathroom unless one of them is inside the shower.
- Ceiling painting in the bathroom was peeling off
- Paid extra for garden views. The views were quite limited, and I would definitely not call that a garden
- Waiters at breakfast were quite pushy to take our plates away even mid-eating. It even happened twice that they only asked if it was ok to pick our plates AFTER they had actually picked them up
- 99% sure that the 'pain au chocolat' they offer for breakfast is the DIY you can buy at the supermarket were you put two cylinders of chocolate inside the dough and then oven it for 20 mins.","

An okay week but could have been better.
"," 6.0 ","Good location, close to family and destination of occasion for travel. Very nice and quiet area, really nice staff. Easy walk into city Centre and shopping mall. Close to beautiful sights and a few good restaurants too.","It would have been nice if at least breakfast was included in the price. Cost for parking is ridiculous with no consideration to the amount already paid for room. Not all buttons worked on the remote control, did not even have access to the tv guide.It being Civid times and house keeping not cleaning rooms while people are staying, supplying enough tea, coffee, toilet rolls and such for the time staying would be more convenient than having to ask each time we run out.","

Wouldn't recommend, unclean and loud
"," 4.0 ","Location was great","Room wasnt very clean, hairs everywhere, bathroom/shower unclean with marks - would be disappointed with this normally, let alone during the pandemic. We had stayed at this same hotel last September and we enjoyed our stay then with no cleanliness issues, but we were really disappointed this time. Air conditioning unit was also very loud, too loud for sleeping. We switched it off part way through the night but then it had a bright green flashing light when switched off which also wasn't ideal for sleeping. Parking is very expensive, even for the area. Breakfast was overcooked. Overall wouldn't recommend.","

"," 5.0 ","It was in close proximity to train station and city centre. Also, was clean.","I had upgraded to a King-size room. However, it transpired upon my asking questions to reception, that the upgrade, was just the bed size, not the room size. The bathroom was very small and compact, in fact, I could touch both sides with my arms outstretched, and the King-size bed, made the main room feel even smaller! Also, car parking at £16 a day was expensive.","

It was ok. I did have higher expectations of the Hilton brand which unfortunately were not met
"," 5.0 ","The location of the hotel was good","Parking was quite pricey. When I checked in I informed staff I would be keeping my car in the car park my whole stay and was told this was not going to be an issue. While out one day. I received a call from a member of staff asking me to move my car as there were tree surgeons in the car park. I said I could not as I was out and asked why I was not informed the night before. I received quite a rude response from the member of staff and raised it with reception on my return. While I received an apology it did not take away from how I felt.","

As someone who doesn’t look well off (and I’m not!), Hilton’s are quite fancy for me so I was worried that I may get judged as I have in some places but nope, super friendly staff and they told me about their Hilton Honors programme so I could check in early (I arrived 3 hours before check in). I would highly recommend the hotel. The location is perfect (it’s next to a small park too), the staff are nice, room is clean, bed is comfy!","I arrived at breakfast 30 mins after they opened and the “hot” food was a little cold. They are kept warmed but was surprised at how cold it was considering I wasn’t there much after opening. But saying this, there is a decent amount of choices, hot food (eggs, sausages - everything for a fry up. Waffle maker, toast, yoghurt, fruit, pastries, cereal. There is also lots of drink options (coffee machine with takeaway cups), juices and water. 
Also (not the end of the world), but the TV didn’t have many channels but was told there would be cable TV. Also couldn’t access the TV guide so had to flick through to see what is on. It would have been helpful to have a note on channels and also how to order room service (and a menu). 
Overall, these cons are very minor but would be nice as improvement. I would still stay here again.","

Improved service and facilities made this a welcome return to The Hilton Garden Inn
"," 10 ","This was the last hotel I stayed at before the first COVID lockdown and was the first place I visited now that restrictions have been eased.  The hotel is adjacent to our offices in Bristol and is my preferred location for its location, facilities and parking.  The staff were outstanding from the moment I arrived till my departure. I specifically applaud the chef and restaurant staff at breakfast.  As ever, all the reception and front of house staff were welcoming, unfailingly courteous and patient..  The team exceeded expectations.","Nothing could be better it was excellent, and a delightful return to one of my favourite business hotels.","

Disappointing for the money spent
"," 4.0 ","The staff were very helpful, and it was great to be able to use the gym (they had a booking system for one person at a time).","After staying in other 4* hotels in Bristol's city centre I feel this was not good value for money. The room was smaller than others I had stayed in - which is fine, but the bathroom was TINY. You didn't even have room to dry yourself after a shower! 
I'm also highly disappointed with the amount I had to pay for parking. For 5 days this essentially cost me an extra £100. There are hotels in Bristol offering free parking so feel ripped off. Food was also disappointing, though I did only have room service on one occasion.","

Restaurant, food and drinks were great","Bed was too firm for  us. I was provided with a duvet to lie on
No clean cups, tea, coffee, toilet roll etc replaced throughout our stay. I needed to queue at reception each day and request these. Bins not emptied.
No secure WiFi
No tv channel description or smart TV facilities available to watch own Netflix etc. Lots of channels not available.
Aircon didn’t work, though a fan was provided. 
Not impressed, considering it was a Hilton","

Muy buena elección para Bristol en relación calidad/precio

Muy buena elección para Bristol en relación calidad/precio
"," 8.0 ","Hotel muy bien ubicado, cerca de la estación de tren y cerca del centro de Bristol (en 10 minutos andando a los dos sitios). La habitación correcta y durante nuestra estancia fue muy tranquilo y silencioso (alguna sirena pero eso parece que es habitual en Bristol). Wifi correcta. Aparcamiento: hay que pagar pero en cales cercanas se cede aparcar por 5 libras toda la noche .
las fotos se corresponde con la relalidad
No tuve servicio de desayuno.

El personal fue super amable en todo momento.   Nos ofrecieron un desayuno continental que estaba disponible a las 4 de la madrugada el día que nos marchamos, nos prestaron un cargador para el móvil y nos facilitaron información sobre trenes a Bath, autobús al aeropuerto, y también un mapa e indicaciones para recorrer Bristol .","","
