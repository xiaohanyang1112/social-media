0,HolidayMaker4,2024-04-30,2.0,"Faulty air con / poor service Used as a base for an early morning flight. Ate in restaurant which was fine, portions quite small but service friendly and efficient. 
Had a family room and despite setting the air con we were all awake at midnight as the room was like a sauna, checking the air con unit it had a fault code flashing. 
Having to traipse to reception at midnight and their only solution was 2 small fans that gave off the same level of noise as a pneumatic drill was pretty poor. It seemed they were fully aware of the fault. They then decided to try and haggle / argue about what discount they could give. I just wanted some sleep so left the staff member and manager to argue it out. Still no refund offered weeks afterwards, we barely slept at all due to the temperature of the room and then 2 ridiculously loud plug in fans as the only solution."
1,laurietF4945KC,2023-06-30,5.0,"Fab spot! Zero complaints. Lovely bar and restaurant, fantastically friendly staff (especially the Spurs fan I met bartending), and the rooms are superbly kept and clean. A great stop the night before a mad-early flight."
2,johnsI1335TX,2024-04-30,1.0,"Ghastly hotel, ghastly food, ghastly beer. Stayed there as it was by Bristol Airport, and had the name of 'Hilton' associated with it. Room is nice, but there any praise stops. Ghastly burger type food, gassy commercial beer with little choice, no nice range. No cash accepted - I deplore that. If I wish to pay using my card that should be my choice, not this manky hotel's. Wouldn't stay here again, even the Premier Inns of the world are better hotels than this absolute dump."
3,chelskira,2024-04-30,3.0,"location is good Charged £200 for one night. The rooms are nothing special. Selection of food is poor. When checking out, charged £45 for parking even though was supposed to get discount?  WTF. Total rip off.  Think the manager is Dick Turpin
Anyone out there looking for a night, there are plenty of other places in the local area.  
This is not a slur on the staff who are all friendly and helpful."
4,owensB6496JD,2024-04-30,5.0,"amazing hotel lovely hotel ,all clean and tidy and rooms are spacious and only a few mins to Bristol airport main terminal which is ideal , staff are welcoming and friendly ,food is amazing  and would definitely recommend to friend's and family ,would stay again"
5,Chris100mk,2024-04-30,3.0,"Style over comfort Dreadful bed , hotel new and modern great facilities bar and food the room disappointing , style over comfort , less than a foot between bed and wall, wooden frame round bed your hurt yourself when getting in and out, mattress awful rock hard comfort level Zero"
6,janeycw,2024-04-30,2.0,"Beware of parking charges!!! I feel a little bad at the 2 star rating because apart from the unsmiling service at 5.30am (and possibly you can forgive them for that given the early hour)when I dropped off my door cards, the hotel itself is ok. The rest of the staff were friendly and very helpful and the hotel clean - it’s what you would expect. I even like the fact there is conditioner in the shower! This review is about the parking fee which is eye-watering and as I wasn’t expecting it has left a very sour taste in the mouth. £45!!! And that was to park for less than 12 hours!! The parking is owned by Bristol airport not the hotel but if I was any part of the hotel/Hilton I would hope that these poor reviews would propel them to try harder with the airport  to lower those charges for customers of the hotel. Bristol Airport you are rob dogs!"
7,DianeE300,2024-03-31,3.0,"BE VERY CAREFUL WITH PARKING CHARGES IN AND AROUND THIS HOTEL!!! This review is not to slate the actual hotel as the hotel it's self is OK and we had no issues with the hotel itself, rooms were comfortable, and breakfast was OK. 
However what they do not tell you before arriving is that parking overnight is usually charged at £60 a night which is ludicrous, this is reduced to £45 if staying at the hotel.
You only have 1 hr parking free upon arrival to check in and then u must use  nearby car parks, the pricing for these are very steep.
My main issue is that upon arriving home after a wonderful holiday to Egypt, I received a £100 fine for stopping outside the entrance to the hotel that evening after a meal in Bristol, for literally 1 minute to drop off my partner and boys before transferring my car to the silver zone car park.  Apparently it's a no stopping prohibited zone and there are lots of signs saying this, how exactly they expect you to be able to read these signs though when you are driving and it's dark I have no clue. 
I appealed it as felt it was unjust considering it was literally a drop off, and was literally less than a minute, but it's been rejected. 
So please please be careful whilst using this hotel. The land is privately owned and the car parks and the b******s will fine u for anything they can!!! I will definitely not be taking my car anywhere near this hotel car park again. I am not the only one who has been fined, my best friend also had a fine the day after myself, for literally leaving the hotel car park within her 1 hr slot.  And stopping to give way to a car coming from the right. How they can get away with this is just ludicrous, when she literally by law has to stop at a junction to give way to the right. Did they expect her to pull out straight into another vehicle approaching. Have seen other reviews on here also about it."
8,lynw367,2024-03-31,4.0,Convenient stay for Bristol flights Convenient hotel within a few mins stroll to Bristol airport. Clean rooms with a shower and 24 hour reception team. A fairly limited but good enough evening menu and reasonable breakfast is included in the room rate. Breakfast bags are availed for those with early red eyed flights!
9,picchio435,2024-03-31,4.0,"Modern, comfortable This is a modern, comfortable hotel. There was lots of space in the reception and dining areas. The food was fine and the bedroom very nice. They gave me an upgrade to a queen room with sofabed so there was plenty of space there too. The over all decor is modern , elegant and minimal"
10,442janec,2024-03-31,3.0,"Jane March 2024 Apart from not finding my booking initially the hotel is good. There should be water bottles in the room
My beef is my flight was the first out of bristol, got up at 3.30am for a hot shower...... very cold shower.
The rooms are not  cheap because of location..... step up please we all deserve hot water, we are all paying for it......"
11,Camper561875,2024-01-31,1.0,"Disappointed with huge fine for trying to enter car park Fined for briefly pausing whilst trying to read a sign next to the barrier to the car park!!
Previously informed via phone discussion with the Hampton by Hilton and also in their confirmation email that we could use the car park for drop off for up to an hour. We were surprised to see a sign about £60 charge and fines at the entrance to the car park so paused (for less than a minute!) to read this. Slapped with a £100 fine in the post for ""stopping"". It was dark, it was cold, we had a baby in the back seat who was just waking up and quite upset, we briefly paused to read the sign. I have tried to appeal this, sent the parking company a confirmation email and told that my appeal is unsuccessful. 

Needless to say I will not be staying again, I will also inform all my family and friends to make sure they never stay here either.

I have emailed Hampton by Hilton and await a reply."
12,BecciGlos,2024-02-29,3.0,"Let down by poor evening meal I have stayed here many times before and the staff are always warm and friendly. Room is clean and functional with good toiletries. However it’s simply not worth the money charged; the lack of competition sets this. The evening meal really let this occasion down; the food quality has been deteriorating and this time it was borderline inedible, washed down with £10 a glass wine. The restaurant could really do with some atmosphere; music, low lighting etc ? 
All in all it does need to improve or lower prices."
13,MrGJC,2024-02-29,4.0,"Convenient, but at a high price. The room, bed and shower are good. The bar/restaurant area is somewhat devoid of any atmosphere. The location is excellent for access to the airport.  I stay at this hotel regularly when travelling. My main gripe with this hotel is the price which has more than doubled over the last few years and I feel that it is now overpriced."
14,Kevandkaren,2024-02-29,3.0,"Average, pricey, but convenient An airport hotel of course so expect it to be a little pricey. This was a little too OTT for me  and with fairly basic standard rooms, food and service. Some staff came across as a tad rude and dismissive at times. Great location for the airport. Just a 5 minute walk and a decent enough, I’d stay again due to convenience and current lack of competition. Main bed in room comfy enough. Bed settee not the greatest. Very clean place."
15,Thamesbabe,2024-01-31,3.0,"Good rooms The room was very good and the digital key useful however it would be nice if a key for the electrics was already in the room. Common areas are like an extension of the airport rather than a hotel lounge.
Drinks are pricy and food extremely average. I felt unwell after eating there. I suggest buying something from M&S in the airport. 
Breakfast was adequate 
There is currently no pedestrian walkway to the terminal, you have to go through the multi story car park dodging cars. Hope this will be resolved sometime."
16,pagents,2024-02-29,3.0,"Parking rip off An average hotel, overpriced like everything near Bristol Airport, average food,terrible coffee,  good service.

The room was OK as expected, being on the third floor was too hot, and difficult to sleep when the bathroom fan never switches off!

They like to surprise their guests that parking is now £60 a night! Watch out for that!

Making a one night stay £220, it's Bristol Airport , Not Vegas!

Never again."
17,Road608464,2024-02-29,5.0,"Good room at the airport Clean, comfortable, large and very warm, lovely bathroom, slept very well and considering it is in the airport grounds I never heard 1 flight land or take off, breakfast was very good, would definitely stay there again, staff were amazing, the young boy that checked me in was a star and even helped me with a trolley for the trip up to the airport in the morning, I was extremely impressed with the staff there"
18,CJWilliamsHeatley,2024-02-29,5.0,"Lovely stay We stayed here the night before our trip to Rome. Check-in was great, very friendly staff of the highest quality customer service. The room was a perfect size and the beds lovely and comfortable. The pillows were a little too soft, but that's a preference not a complaint. Despite being next to an airport there was zero noise, couldn't even hear traffic. Plus, being at the end of the corridor prevented the usual ""hotel noise"" of opening/Closing doors etc. room temperature was easily adjustable.

We didn't eat that night but did have a coffee in the bar. Again, exceptional customer service. There is a handy section selling travel toiletries (all under 100ml).

Breakfast was great. Buffet style offering pastries, pancakes, waffles and full English. Can't fault it.

Will definitely be booking again next time we fly from Bristol. Hotel is just a few minutes walk to departures with handy signage from hotel to the terminal to make sure you can't get lost!"
19,mandymarytaylor,2024-02-29,5.0,"Well worth staying before you fly The staff were excellent, Chris & Stella(The Dream Team), sorted us out. The customer service was Outstanding. The hotel was Clean, Warm, Pleasant and Welcoming. The staff are very knowledgeable of their hotel and surrounding amenities, even using their own personal phones to help customers, nothing to a problem or to much effort. Stayed here before and definitely stay here again."
20,mickeyandminniemad,2024-01-31,4.0,"Nice hotel, pricey, but no alternative on airport grounds This hotel is pleasant and we had a good sleep before our early departure. They provide a continental selection for breakfast from 4am which was very useful when you have an early flight. We ate in the restaurant/bar in the evening and the food was ok, but expensive for the quality. We were lucky when we checked in that there were only a couple of people ahead of us, because a queue quickly formed and appeared to be moving very slowly.  We took the lift to our room and the lights to the rooms were off, it was very dark and I wouldn’t have been happy trying to find my way on my own. 

I must also add that the quick route from the hotel to the terminal is currently shut, meaning a much further walk around the car park and the back of the hotel, not great, especially when it’s raining."
21,Wander10741820991,2024-01-31,5.0,Convenient stop over Very comfy and convenient after a long journey. They are welcoming at any time of day or night and had a drink for us at midnight which was very welcome. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and again the timing makes it easy to leave for your flight early so they have it all geared around convenience for your flight
22,123pix,2024-01-31,4.0,"Convenient location with comfortable rooms Great location within minutes of the airport. Pleased with our room which was spacious and had a very comfortable bed. The restaurant was also pleasant with a reasonable priced  menu, apart from the wine which was quite expensive. We did have an issue with the overnight parking charge which was different to the amount quoted when we originally booked, but the management kindly resolved this for us."
23,PJAnderson83,2024-01-31,1.0,"£165 for 2 nights of parking Avoid this place like the plague! I stayed here for 2 nights for work and ended up having to pay £165 in parking fees! Not a single sign anywhere to highlight their extortionate prices. The hotel is as basic as a Travel Lodge, the food is utterly abysmal, and the bitter taste their parking fees leave you with, is enough to deter anyone from booking again. Shameful!"
24,Mis2006,2024-01-31,3.0,"Too expensive  A comfortable hotel, well positioned beside the airport terminal. It's comfortable and pleasant but somewhat overpriced! It's like a Premier Inn ...you queue to order food, wine is ridiculously expensive at over £8 a glass....... It's acceptable but it needs competition!!!!"
25,DevonJohn,2024-01-31,2.0,"Disappointing for such a Prestigious Name Used the Hotel to save an early morning drive to Bristol Airport with an 09:30 Book In to the Multi Storey Car Park. Check In was straight forward as was parking the Car in their Car Park. Very disappointed with the Bar and Eating Area which was untidy and looked well worn, even to the extent of having cushions missing from the settees, tables were uncleared and had not been wiped down. The meal was mediocre to say the least, expensive and not up to what I would expect from a Hotel of this name. The rooms and sleep quality were very good. Where you have to be very careful is the Car Parking, on check out you are advised to process your car park ticket through a machine in the Lobby, I assumed that it would just be validated for exit however, I was asked to pay £60:00 for the 1 night parking. Reception then told me that if I push a little white button the charge would be reduced to only £45:00.as I had stayed at the Hotel. Nowhere in the Hotel details does it advise you of these charges, it just say Car Parking available. It would have been better/cheaper for me if I had booked my car into the Multi Storey the night before and then just walked across to the Hotel. These charges are almost bordering on extortionate. then to cap it all, having paid, we decided to have breakfast only to find that when we tried to leave the Car Park that the exit time limit had expired and it would not let us out. I had to re-park and get the Receptionist to arrange for our release. They could do a lot to improve this Hotel but I will not be using them again."
26,davidsR7876DR,2024-01-31,3.0,"Not as good as previous visits The room was OK, getting here was a nightmare, as signage was poor. We ate in the restaurant which was OK, but we were charged 40 p more for our main course. We weren't shown a wine list and ended up paying £37.50 for a bottle of wine which costs 20 Eurosin Spain. Seemed to be a very expensive stay. Not good value for money."
27,598janed,2024-01-31,5.0,"Highly recommend Booked last minute after flight home was cancelled due to storm. Lovely hotel, comfortable and clean rooms, friendly staff, good selection of veggie options at breakfast, served hot food and drink in large clean bar area. Highly recommend, tho no complimentary toothpaste, which would have helped 👍"
28,Y9754WYmargaretw,2023-10-31,1.0,"Impossible to get to with airport expansion and lack of consideration for disabled people! No access for disabled! This is not actually the hotels fault but they should take action and put pressure on the airport. I booked a room having stayed there before and this time my flight landed past midnight. There’s a sign saying Hilton temporary route. This so called access is impossible for anyone with reduced mobility, with a walking aid or in a wheelchair. I was with my daughter on foot. She literally had to carry me to the hotel in the rain a pitch dark. It’s an absolute disgrace and the airport is responsible but the Hilton should never have allowed this or should provide free vehicle transportation."
29,mgraham2015,2024-01-31,5.0,"Great location next to terminal Excellent location right across from the terminal. Also right next door to the multi storey car park. Hotel was very clean, check in and out very efficient and friendly staff. Rooms were modern and comfortable and food options for dinner and breakfast were more than enough.....highly recommend."
30,odo3680,2023-12-31,5.0,Overnight at Bristol Airport We had a night here either side of an EasyJet holiday. Always liked this hotel it is so convenient and everyone is friendly and helpful. On this occasion my wife and I noticed that the beds in the Hampton by Hilton BRS was MORE COMFORTABLE than the bed in the 5 star resort that we spent Christmas at. We liked the straightforward comfort food available at night (on arrival). The order at the bar arrangement works well. Also impressed that the breakfast had non-dairy (soya) choices.
31,cliffcottages1,2024-01-31,4.0,"Fantastic location  Stayed here after late night flight home , so easy to access. Rooms clean tidy but very small tho for a stay over just to grab some sleep was fine . Breakfast was good . Carpark expensive and we were nearly charged £60 for 5 mins access staff did adjust this prompt for us ."
32,Carlaconsort,2023-12-31,5.0,"Still Good To Stay Just Don't Park ! Another one night stop over to enable the Missus to catch a very early flight, as with previous visits helpful and friendly hotel staff. Assigned a ground floor room, as before this again was immaculately clean and tidy. A basic uncooked breakfast available at 5am and cooked from 6am which is an excellent boon for early risers. Thus pleased with continuing high level of service at this hotel. However BE WARNED - Bristol Airport own the parking lot and have raised the parking charge from the £14.50 it was in October 2023 to £45 ! Had it not been for the hotel reception staff it would have been £60. How can this be justified ?"
33,429PaulP,2023-12-31,1.0,Rip off £60 to park for 0 to 24 hours. Disgraceful. I feel ripped off. Used to park there regularly for around an hour and didn't mind paying a premium for the convenience but clearly they have changed their pricing structure. No wonder the carpark was empty.
34,200ja,2023-12-31,5.0,"Great hotel  Brilliant stay, comfortable rooms and very friendly staff.
Had an amazing night's sleep.
The gym was a god send as I felt really lazy after travelling all day.
Would recommend joining the Hilton honours loyalty program as I got free WiFi and got a later check out time 😁
Will definitely be back!"
35,DevonPoohbear,2023-12-31,5.0,Another nice stay Stayed on the 10 December checked in by Jack what  lovely friendly chap nothing to much trouble. Also checked in on 25 December at midnight and Tom the duty manager went above and beyond. Rooms nice and clean. Lovely full English breakfast. Handy for late night arrivals who don’t want to drive after a flight
36,Chillibonbon59,2023-10-31,4.0,"Average except for the vegan breakfast  A bit impersonal for dinner (you have to queue at the bar to order and pay, then find a table) and there was only one vegan main course option /one vegan side, but the sweet potato falafels were crisp and tasty. Breakfast was a good choice of clearly-labelled options, kept properly hot, and I was given vegan croissants when I asked about bread and pastry options. The hash browns were excellent and the croissants were out of this world. Staff were polite - the older gentleman among the breakfast servers was particularly helpful. The room was pleasant, well insulated from exterior noises, and spotlessly clean. The high price reflects its proximity to the airport rather than any additional quality over regular hotel chains. I’d have given it 3 stars but the helpful server and the outstanding breakfast got it the 4th."
37,UkMd_,2023-12-31,3.0,"Lovely stay let down by the catering This is a well laid out hotel, the rooms are clean and comfortable, there is plenty of parking, the mini fitness room is good enough for a maintenance workout and the location is ideal for the terminal. That is let down by the catering. There are plenty of staff and they are all running around looking busy, but nothing is really getting done. When we stayed the restaurant wasn’t particularly busy but there was a 45-60 minute wait for food and even then people were waiting longer. The person sat next to us was offered two meals that were for another table and after waiting over an hour they settled for a pizza, even though that wasn’t what they ordered, but was the quickest food to get out. The lack of catering management continued into breakfast, with long waits for food to be replaced on the hot plate, broken catering machines and a general feel of disorganisation. If a hotel is good enough to offer a catering service then it should be adequately managed, which definitely lets this hotel down."

39,K8960LDabbyw,2023-12-31,1.0,"Wouldn’t bother again Felt like we were sleeping on a concrete mattress. I don’t normally bother with reviews but this was probably the worst night sleep I’ve ever had in a hotel. Was not worth the price we paid. What kind of hotel doesn’t even invest in decent mattresses?  
Starting off my holiday with a bad back."
40,Madsmids94,2023-12-31,2.0,"Monopoly at the airport very overpriced. The line for check in at midnight was outrageously long, full of families and children waiting to go to bed after travelling. The rooms were cheap, more like a £70 a night room. WiFi was not included which seems ridiculous in a hotel used often for business travel. The room was freezing. The breakfast and pillows were great. They just seem to have a monopoly at the airport and are taking advantage of it with the pricing."
41,A6701RSbilll,2023-12-31,5.0,"Perfect location for early flight. Couldn’t improve the experience I had. 

Early flight. 

Very clean and well equipped room (for what I needed).

Check in easy with polite and efficient front desk team. 

Restaurant as expected. Nothing flashy but a good enough menu and quick order to service process. 

Restaurant staff very friendly and on the ball. 

Room price included breakfast but unable to have it due to having to be at the terminal at 4am. 

Easy walk to terminal, which will be even easier when the work outside is finished."
42,618DavidB618,2023-12-31,5.0,"Excellent Airport Hotel, worthy of the title. I don’t often write reviews but I’ve got to give props when they’re due. A lot of airport hotels could learn from this Hampton at Bristol airport. The rooms are fresh, clean and comfortable. They offer continental breakfast from 4am, for those with early flight, and cooked from 6. For late arrivals they have a 24/7 menu, limited but still with decent choices to suit most people, and the bar’s apparently open until 2am. They are doing everything they can to make the traveller as comfortable as possible."
43,hollywills12,2023-11-30,2.0,"Not the best I expected more for a ‘newish’ airport hotel; well the only BRS airport hotel. 
Stayed in a family room, cots are very small compared to say a premier inn.
They wouldn’t heat up our baby food yet the bar manager said the night before they did for someone else but there was a new kitchen manager on and he said no. Wish he didn’t say that as we paid £7 for a tinned Heinz tomato soup with toast! 
Room was freezing (yes there was heating but it was blowing cold air all night) 
Duvets are those crispy noises bulky duvets and the pillows were like rocks!! 
I’d rather be sleep deprived and leave early next time!"
44,Cherriesfan99,2023-11-30,3.0,"Not a good start with a fifteen minute walk in the rain, and more to departures It was and still maybe a bit of a pain  mving our luggage and selves through the heavy rain in a bit of tour toBristol Airport departure - you can see it quite plainly from the hotel, but are forced to drag the cases through the car parks, up the inclines , cross 3 road, negotiate the mud left by the contractors to reach departures. Not a great start. Also the front desk at Hampton by Hilton could not be less helpful as far as directions. Could they not have had the insight to either produce a leaflet / map or at least have a notice board indicating the route and how long it would take to get to departures - for some this might be critical. For others with a disabilty or very young children they were on their own, quite literally. Currently there is no provising for transport  to the airport other than walking.
The hotel was ok a slight step up in quality from a travelodge, but a huge price difference. 
Evening meal was a bit of a shambles, so we skipped breakfast (which was included in our room rate). This probably our only visit to HbyH Brristol Airport."

Great Customer Service We arrived into Bristol Airport at 1am in the morning and due to a serious accident on the roads outside the airport, 100s were stranded, with the prospect of spending the night in Bristol Airport. I rang the Hilton and spoke to the very friendly manager there called Tom. Tom couldn't have been more helpful,  going beyond the call of duty. ...he secured a room for me, my wife, and 2 young children at a reasonable price with a nice breakfast included. The room itself was clean, and the shower was also nice. would recommend! Thanks, Tom and the team!"
49,rock_30,2023-10-31,2.0,"Airport hotel Stayed overnight for an early morning flight. Location is ideal - right by the multi story car park and close to walk to the terminal. That’s pretty much where the positives end. 

Negatives:
- checked in and chose room via the app in advance but key card in app doesn’t work so have to check in at the front anyway (not much of a queue for us but noted it was much bigger later on!)
- Queue for food and/or drink was very big after 6pm. Food and drinks were ok, nothing to shout home about. Wanted a drink midway through my meal but would have meant a +20 minute queue while my food got cold! 
- Kids menu was terrible (chicken nuggets or hummus (not and, or) for £8!! 
- Snacks (those you’d normally have from a vending machine) are via the same long queue above (ie bring your own or go hungry!)
- Pull out bed in room was very uncomfortable and double bed in room was small. Considering this is a Hilton and we paid £200 for the night this was very disappointing. 
- We didn’t use the hotel car park but noted it’s £5 for 0-20 minutes!
Overall it’s convenient for flights, but unfortunately monopolises the market here. 

Not the greatest hotel from the Hilton empire!"
50,mairew2013,2023-10-31,3.0,"Not to Hilton standards Stayed here overnight before an early flight. Room was absolutely fine, comfortable bed. The restaurant left a lot to be desired - more like a fast food cafe where you have to queue up to order and the food is mediocre. It is advertised as being 3mins walk from the terminal but as an elderly couple with luggage it took us at least 15. It is uphill and was not easy for us. Fortunately it wasn’t raining! There is a lot of building work going on so I suspect the path may be better when this is complete but some form of transport for less able guests would be appreciated. Breakfast was available from 4 a.m. which was good."
51,jtwitc283227,2023-10-31,4.0,On site airport hotel Great for an early flight as short stroll to airport (currently not very direct due to works). Hotel was pleasant and good breakfast included starting at 4am. Evening meal was the only disappointment and needed to queue at bar to order it.. Perhaps better to go to the airport.
52,103rachbecky,2023-10-31,5.0,"Lovely  We checked in around 11.30pm 22nd we are checked in by the lovely Manager on duty, excellent lovely customer service with a smile. Quick check in, confirmed if we weren't happy with room they could move us due to me asking if was quiet room, fantastic service! Room was lovely, same design as the Newcastle upon tyne one that we stayed at last Christmas. Was a a joining room next door but I think the complete tiredness from long day traveling, the time difference caught up on us, the though moving our luggage all the way to another room,  We were just happy with lovely clean room. Grateful for the sleep and comphy bed! Went bar get drink all I wanted was hot chocolate night cap and the lovely receptionist went above and beyond. I cant have dairy so with quick thinking she put some hot water in tea pot, dairy free milk in Jug with chocolate powder in seperate cup. It's service like this that I love so much! There was no such thing as a no in her mind and her creative thinking just made my night a perfect end to such a long day. thank you so much so sorry I didnt get your name. Breakfast was lovely had lots alternative to milk options from Yogurts to milk, cereal, spread and even vegan sausages. You have to excuse my excitment as I just came back from Turkey and alot of my food options had milk in it so it was truly refreshing to be back to alot of options again. Highly recomend Hampton by Hilton, was 10-10 place to stay with lovely staff from Evening & Morning"
53,Cranberrypumpkinpie,2023-10-31,3.0,"Good staff, basic hotel for inflated price. Handy for early flight though. Stayed for 1 night prior to 0600 flight from airport.  Hotel is clean and tidy but VERY overpriced for what it is.  I would say more like an upmarket Travel Lodge to be honest.  We were in our room less than 12 hours - didn't check in till 4pm and left 0300 to check in at the terminal. So, easy money for them as we hardly made use of room.
Room very clean - issues were with air con and inability to open a window - even a small amount = meant we woke up with thick stuffy heads due to not having any fresh air.
We ate in the bar - surprisingly the food was ok.  Not huge portions but very reasonably priced compared to price of the room.  I thought they would have inflated the bar/restaurant prices but not so.  
We did not have breakfast as we had to check in early - they did offer a takeaway bag but at 0300hrs neither of us felt like eating.
The trek to the terminal is longer than normal and I am limited mobility - what I found most difficult is that you are walking into the arrivals 'traffic' of people and they are all walking towards you when you are walking TO  the terminal and nobody moves out the way and there is no separation between arrival and departure walkways so it's a bit of a bun fight and if you are poor mobility it can be a bit daunting.  Not helped by steps, uneven surface and lots of trollies in the way - not at all helpful and would be a nightmare for someone with impaired vision.
The staff at this hotel were VERY good - jolly and helpful (especially one blondish girl on reception who was very chatty) - but at check in times there was a bit of a queue so more staff are needed."
54,jennym73,2023-10-31,3.0,"Night stay before our early morning flight We had a early morning flight so thought we would stay the night before as it’s a 5 minute walk to the terminal. Check in was pleasant, room was quiet small and the bed was very hard and uncomfortable. 
Room was nice and clean but there wasn’t any decaf coffee and not enough milk so had to go down to reception to get some.
Breakfast at 4.30am was only continental which was fine with us. 
We left the car parked in the hotel until we came back which was very convenient too."
55,jaydoubleyou1969,2023-10-31,5.0,"Perfect for a late or early flight We arrived back from holiday at 00:40 so decided to stay here before travelling home, and we are so glad we did. The room was stunning, with a huge shower and very comfortable bed (exactly what you need after a four hour flight). Breakfast is from 4am to 11am, we caught the end of the service but it was still really hot and fresh.

The only (slight) downside, which isn't the hotel's fault, is that due to building works the walk from the terminal is more of a trek than usual but it's still great to get through security and be in your room within half an hour! Would definitely stay here again if we were flying out of Bristol early or late."
56,Flyer17972783839,2023-10-31,1.0,Worst hotel experience  Absolutely worst experience we have ever had with a hotel. Received an email the day before our stay confirming we had two rooms booked for one night prior to our early morning flight. Arrived at the hotel to be told our booking had not gone through properly on their system despite the email. No rooms were then available so the incredibly rude receptionist left us stranded for the night not offering any assistance until she was told that one of our party had health condition and even then was finger pointing to her colleagues rather than offering much assistance. Completely put a dampener on 30th birthday celebrations. As well as going on to cost us extra when we eventually did find a place to spend the night. We will be putting in a formal complaint but felt it was worth offering an honest review to avoid disappointment for others. Would not recommend to anyone
57,lordieCornwall,2023-10-31,1.0,"Extremely bad sewage smell coming from air con Raw sewage smell coming out of air conditioning, sickening, too late to move rooms as we have an early flight in morning so have turned it off but left with the horrible smell in the room 
This needs to be sorted out 
I’m staying here at this hotel tonight 20th October 2023"
58,ShelbyOH,2023-10-31,5.0,"Sharp as crystal in Bristol. Check in was flawless, this Hampton had light-years better facilities than the US Hamptons. There was a gentleman working in the restaurant named Nick who couldn't have been more accommodating if he tried. Our room was clean and the main areas seemed freshly updated. The only complaint about the room is the design choice of translucent bathroom doors. The light is very bright and can be disturbing to others in the room that are trying to sleep.

The hotel's proximity to the Bristol airport was the main reason we chose it, but be forewarned that they do not have a shuttle, it's about a five to ten minute walk to the terminal which can be a struggle for mobility impaired guests."
59,shonac358,2022-11-30,4.0,"Great location for air travellers This chain offers a good standard which gives you confidence to stay. Close to Bristol airport so great if you have an early or late flight.
Bar and restaurant so you needing head out and can relax from the moment you arrive."
60,Ich-Dien-Cymru,2023-10-31,4.0,"Great service, bathroom needs a bit of attention We stayed like many others before we took a flight out of the airport, service was faultless, rooms were fine, just felt the decor of the bathroom along with the hardware needed attention, shower head awful, toilet seat loose, apart from that all okay"
61,neilw300,2023-10-31,5.0,"Great stay Checked in on Saturday afternoon for an overnight stay at this great hotel prior to flying early next morning.We cannot fault it hats off to the lovely young fella on reception who checked us in very friendly informative and efficient he has a great future in hospitality along with every member of staff we encountered everyone was so friendly the waiters bar staff and reception staff could not do enough for you.
When we mentioned a quiet room the receptionist put us in a quiet area on the second floor and I must say that the door and window soundproofing was top notch we never heard a thing .The rooms were very very clean and we will definitely be staying again on our next trip.
Only minus but my opinion is that the hotel is a card only no cash hotel we watched a few older couples get into a flap at the bar when they got cash out to pay only to be told card only and bizarrely the car park pay machine (maybe not hotel run ?) was cash or card what a lovely option."
62,jonathanp631,2023-10-31,5.0,"Would definitely recommend We chose to combine this hotel and parking offer through TUI as we had an early morning flight and it seemed good value for money. Check in was friendly and swift. The staff were helpful throughout our stay. Rooms were spotless and looked brand new. Beds were comfy and usual facilities excellent - tv- Wi-Fi - tea and coffee tray.
As we had a really early check in for our flight we intended to pop over to the airport, check in and then pop back to the hotel once breakfast started. We mentioned this to the helpful receptionist in the morning and she presented us with a breakfast to go. How brilliant! 
We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone travelling through Bristol airport."
63,MonstrousPippin,2023-09-30,5.0,"Very comfortable and convenient Excellent stay for one night after a late arrival flight. Very efficiently checked in, lovely comfortable room, nice bar area and very reasonable check out time of 11am. All the info you need is easily accessed from the info card in the room or the interactive telly. Very comfortable bed with plenty of pillows and very clean. Tea and coffee facilities in the room. Breakfast was good on the day we were there. The hotel is handy for the Bristol Flyer shuttle bus too. Would definitely use this hotel again if my flights are at odd times."
64,MrsBB2000,2023-09-30,3.0,"A high price for the convenient location  This hotel is all about the location, if you arrive/depart very late at night or very early in the morning it is a most convenient location of course only a short walk from the terminal.  

Greetings at reception were warm and the check in very efficient.  

Annoyingly  the next day no one could tell me where the Uber collection point was or where the taxi company was situated, no collection from outside the hotel, so a little annoying.  Most hotels have a map so they can easily point out these types of locations, or staff that can easily explain them. 

I did find the Uber collection point and when Uber decided they couldn't be bothered to collect me on a busy Sunday morning Arrow Cars situated just outside the terminal provided me with transport, it was a good service if a little on the expensive side.  Of course now I know more about the set up of the airport I would either catch the bus into Bristol or arrange transport with Arrow.  

The room was bog standard but seemed to have excellent sound proofing which was great!   The sink drain was blocked but other than that every thing such as towels and cleanliness was all good. 

Its a shame that Hampton hotel and Arrow Cars have a monopoly in the airport which adds to the high prices.  As the airport grows alternatives and a railway connection would be good. 

The breakfast was dreadful and the worst I had in the UK that week.  The food was so hyper processed and poor quality, although the Ubley yoghurt was good.  I felt for such a high price, such a terrible breakfast was annoying!  I will try in future to pay extra for better flight arrival/departure times so I can avoid having to stay near the airport at all, my bad, my lesson learnt."
65,sizmursan,2023-09-30,5.0,Rgis year's stay We chose this hotel because we enjoy staying so close to the airport but in quietness. The rooms are excellent and the service is proficient. The hotel does need to employ more staff to cope with evening meals as the tables are not ready for reoccupation quickly enough. The staff do their VERY best!
66,PJAnderson83,2023-09-30,2.0,"Priced like a 5 star, but no better than a budget city hotel. Priced like a 5 star, but no better than a budget city hotel.

Rooms are very basic. Modest size but fairly 'clinical'. Clean, but basic. Staff seemed friendly enough throughout. 

The worst part by a long mile though was the food and restaurant. It's like a school canteen. Menu is very childish: chips, burgers, pizzas and a couple of other bits. No table service either, you have to order and collect at the bar. When food was ready, you're also told cutlery is somewhere else. Loads of staff loitering doing nothing, yet it's all self service? Bizarre! 

I had the daily special curry which was a Madras: straight out of a jar! Stale popadom which bent rather than snapped, over cooked rice, accompanied by a tasteless, meatless curry. Naan bread was like play dough too, just awful. £17 for the curry, £7 for a pint of lager!

Don't be fooled by the brand ""Hilton"". This is comparable to a basic city Travel Lodge. I shall never return: it would make more sense to stay up to 30 minutes away in a better (Spa) hotel, and get a taxi to the airport... you'd still save money too!"

68,PhantomAde,2023-09-30,4.0,"Good overnight stay This hotel is the best one in terms of location at Bristol airport, there is building works so a slightly longer walk from the terminal but is not too bad. Like the fact you can pick your own room and check-in on the app if you like.

Room had everything needed for an overnight stay although flannels would have been nice for the shower. Room was very clean and quiet and enjoyed a meal at the restaurant. Menu not the best or the cheapest but was OK and would use again."
69,PhilipD591,2023-09-30,5.0,"Great night's stay at the airport at the beginning and end of our holiday. Very friendly and helpful staff.  Comfortable beds.  Delicious breakfast with lots of choice, including GF options.  You can get 1 hours free parking to pick someone up or drop them off with their bags which is really useful if parking at the Silver Car Park.  Highly recommend."
70,maggie2628,2023-09-30,4.0,Clean hotel and friendly staff Lovely clean hotel and rooms. Staff very friendly and helpful. The food was lovely and a continental breakfast was available for any early checkouts. Very close to the airport which is especially good if you have twilight checkin for your flight. Parking was expensive on top of the room rate which was the only downside.
71,Newquay_or_bust,2023-09-30,1.0,"Very disappointed I rarely leave negative reviews and only when strictly necessary and when someone might listen. 
First off the room was dirty, it literally looked like someone emptied a hover bag between the pleats of the curtains. 
The restaurant seats were grimy and loads were just shells with the covers completely gone. 
Expensive! Blimey, you’d think we were staying at the ritz the prices of the drinks and food, yes I’d expect to pay more but come on, there is a limit to ripping people off!
Very very very dissatisfied but once bitten twice , never ever again"
72,C8056OClucye,2023-09-30,1.0,"A dreadful experience. This was a dire experience as the start of a holiday. Whilst the room was ok (clean, adequately equipped) the catering was appalling. To order any food or drink you had to queue in an airport security arrangement of taped aisles. We ordered  two white wine spritzers and a packet of crisps for £22(!) to start and specified dry wine with soda. Neither the guy at the till nor the assistant behind the  bar had any idea what wines they sold or what type they were. We opted for one but when we got them to the table the ‘soda’ was lemonade. I took them back and explained that I had reiterated soda. She made me two more using two different sofa streams. One was indeed soda but the other was still lemonade. When I took them both back to the manager and asked for a refund, having lost heart and hope, she didn’t believe that one was lemonade as ‘it would have been more bubbly’. She declined to taste it.  This was as insulting as it was rude. I got a refund and went to the airport concourse and bought a super bottle of M&S wine for £10. Sadly there were no restaurants open in the evening before Departures so the hotel has a monopoly on food. Their menu is very limited, unimaginative and heavy. No salads. Not even fish and chips which would have been a safe bet. In fact, the watery chicken korma was ok though there were no side like mango chutney or raita (obvs). It was very beige. 
In addition the ambience, lighting and seating are like a hospital waiting room - and two banquettes had no seats, just holes to the floor. It was a depressing and frustrating experience and an awful start to our holiday. And it’s £172 for the cheapest room!  A total rip off. We didn’t risk the breakfast next morning. We will avoid this at all costs in future and fly from another airport if possible."
73,JuliaH590,2023-09-30,5.0,"Couldn’t fault anything but the price! I rarely write rave reviews so this is an exception.

I have nothing negative to say about this hotel.  It was convenient, nice room. decent sized towels for once, a comfy bed and an above average breakfast than you usually find  in airport hotels.  Charming staff and a warm welcome despite it being 1 in the morning.

The only downside was the price which I thought was very high for a 3* hotel but they are the only hotel at the airport and so I suppose can charge whatever they like as there is no competition.

I would, despite this  recommend the hotel."
74,roseym413,2023-09-30,5.0,Overnight stay prior to flight. Absolutely wonderful stay. Easy to find and park.

75,SueHind,2023-08-31,2.0,"The Hard Beds meant very poor sleep The general experience at the hotel was good from arrival, serving of a meal, cleanliness, quiet room and leaving early the following morning. We had stayed due to a very early flight and had hoped to have a good nights sleep. Due to the hardness of the bed even sleeping on top of the duvet was not enough. It was such a basic issue and not one easily resolved so left at 3 am for the flight with no comment. In the future I will see if they have extra duvets I can  sleep on! Or stay at Premier Inn down the road"
76,melsimcoe,2023-08-31,4.0,"Comfortable stay We stayed for two nights on the 28th and 29th August as our flight got cancelled due to air traffic control problems and our flight was rebooked for the 30th August. Reception advised that there were no rooms but online it showed availability so we booked on line. It was expensive at £217 a night but conveniently close to the airport a one minute walk and I felt safe. The staff were friendly and polite nothing was to much trouble. There was a computer with a printer for free use so we were able to print our new boarding passes. We ate both nights in the restaurant, the menu was limited but good food and quick service and there was a children menu. Drinks were expensive £7.50 for a pint.
 The room was spotless and the beds were really comfortable, we had a good night's sleep. For breakfast you could have waffles, toast, cereals, fruit and a choice of a hot food to name a few. Vegans and vegetarians were catered for. This is my third stay at the hotel and I highly recommend it if you are flying from Bristol, although I do feel it's very expensive but you are paying that high price for the convenience."
77,E7716CJpaulb,2023-08-31,2.0,"Cannot get the room 50 mins before 3pm Shame when you arrive at 2.10pm you are left to wait in reception for the 3pm check in time or pay 10 pounds extra. Why when the room will be ready and it’s not really early.

Hotel is dead quiet. 
Poor customer service this year.

79,918kelleb,2023-08-31,5.0,"The perfect start to a holiday! I booked the morning before we were due to fly as a last minute decision. The reservations team were fantastic; confirming availability almost instantly. 
On arrival, the reception staff were attentive and polite. When we explained our flight was before the breakfast service commenced the following morning, they immediately offered a take-out service. 
Our room was perfectly adequate for our family of 4.
We ate in the bar/restaurant onsite, and thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Again, the staff we encountered were all very good.
On check-out the following morning at an ungodly hour, the receptionist was efficient and polite, providing us with 4 bags of continental breakfast, each containing a croissant, juice box, piece of fruit, and a cereal bar.
I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are flying out of Bristol, and we will certainly be booking again."

81,DawnP233,2023-08-31,5.0,"Great overnight stay 👌  Last minute decision to try and avoid the early morning drive and it was a very good decision 👌 

The double room was clean, so comfortable and the sound proofing was out of this world 😍 Had such a good night sleep before the flight 😍

Had the early continental breakfast which had a good range of food and plentiful in supply 😁

Only downside was the additional charge for parking overnight as that wasn't included in the price 

Would definitely stay there again 😊"
82,X1994HAjm,2023-08-31,1.0,"Plain awful - if I could mark it nothing I would Your staff on check in, Hannah and colleague from F&B are so far away from any form of any customer hospitality, what an awful check in.
No nice welcome (good evening, how was your travel..anything really) 
Considering you welcome weary guests from all around the world, this is lacking any form of kindness and plain customer service.
The entrance to your hotel is not evident with the current works happening at 11pm at night. I fed this back on arrival and the response was ""there are signs"" and ""it's not us doing the works""
I had prewarned the hotel works of our arrival time and noted I was travelling with my dad (in his late 60's and frail and my toddler). No mention of this, with the darkness and the line of bus goers, we missed it.
I appreciate it's not your works, however the response was plain awful. A sneer from the lady in the f&b uniform and a laugh from Hannah as we were walking away. Talk about school bullies. 
Maybe some more training in customer service would be welcomed. 

It’s not cheap to stay and be insulted/mocked within 2 minutes of arrival, but you’re guaranteed it at the Hilton Bristol Airport.

I see from past reviews that a lack of accountability is served and most guests who review negatively get a cut and paste response.

Do better please. Simply unkind and very unwelcoming."
83,slargemail,2023-08-31,1.0,"Don't bother staying here! We got to the hotel late after 1am due to our flight into Bristol being delayed. When we got to the hotel to check we were told they only had accessible rooms available as rooms are allocated on a first-come basis. What is the point of asking what room you would like during the booking process then if it's ignored? I feel they took advantage that we were arriving so late.

The room was basic. The shower floor was slippy so I had to put a towel on the floor. The bathroom looked grubby and there was a slight smell of poo from the drain in the shower!

We were tired and there was no point complaining as the only rooms they had left were accessible ones anyway!

The room was not worth the £161 I paid, it was worth about half of that!

If I could find a way to complain on their site I will be asking for a refund or a least a part refund!

Next time I will pay a little extra and just get a taxi back to Devon if we get a late flight back. Never staying here again!"

The hotel is spotlessly clean, our room was lovely with nice comfy bed & pillows, lovely shower etc. 
The staff at reception and the bar staff were super friendly. 
We ate in the restaurant which was fine. Not a great range of food on offer but what we had was lovely washed down with a few drinks. Actually, as an anniversary gift the hotel gave us a voucher for a couple of drinks at the bar. So unexpected but a lovely thought.

87,BigFoodlover0,2023-08-31,1.0,"Where has good old customer service gone???? 😢 Having paid nearly £250 for an overnight stay and a glass of wine each the night before our flight, I was notified that I'd left a small item in the room which the hotel agreed to post to me. The cost was £1.15 and if I wanted my item, I would have to pay the £1.15!!!

The hotel was ok, room was ok, but it is already overpriced for what it is, purely because there is little alternative choice. To have insisted I paid the £1.15 to get my item back made me laugh, but on a serious note it showed complete lack of customer service and complete focus on profits. 

Come on Hilton - Surely you could have spared  £1.15 out of your £8 Billion worldwide Profits last year!!🤣🤣🤣"

The one disappointing thing was the breakfast.  It was a basic buffet with very limited choices. Only scrambled eggs available for the English breakfast and that had the appearance of being cooked in a plastic bag. Premier Inn breakfasts are far superior to this. I expected much better from the Hilton Brand. (£213)

96,joymN6644AF,2023-06-30,5.0,"Ignore the negative reviews! Ignore the negative reviews about this brilliant hotel!  Firstly the Reception staff are amazing given that they know most of their clients will be at the hotel less than 12 hours.  They are polite and friendly.   I have probably stayed there 6 times in 2 years and have never heard any plumbing noises.  Book here for peace of mind knowing you are at the airport and a stone's throw from the check in desk.  Even if you do what I did this trip and sleep through the wake up call you can still make it in plenty of time!

Whether you book a room airport facing or airport car park facing you will find things quiet, but the car park facing rooms are perfectly quiet and my favourite.  Yes the price is a little expensive but you are already there!  Yes the food and drink is expensive and the menu is limited and unvarying but there is something for everyone.  I have always stayed on the top floor, floor 3 so that I dont hear people walking over head.  I haven't ready any review that this is a problem however.

I always use this hotel before a flight and sometimes after a flight depending on the circumstances. 

This time (ten days ago) I used the gym for the first time. It is  spotlessly clean, well equipped and has plenty of COVID cleaning measures still in place.  I pretty much had it to myself.  

The only negatives about this hotel are the coldness of the rooms in the winter months but you can ask Reception to over ride the room controls and heat the room for you.  You will also have to ask them to stop the heating over ride too when you are warm enough.  The breakfast is what lets the side down.  Every time I have stayed here the tables have been sticky, probably not wiped down from the night before.  The choice of food and the food itself is a bit lack lustre and doesnt match the quality you find in every other department.  You can perfectly well find food to eat but its a bit of a downer.  But given that you are at the airport and you eye is on the clock it doesnt matter that much. 

Book, you won't regret it."

The food, although nothing special was served quickly and hot and did us well. We were missing covers for the cot but the staff very quickly fixed this problem. Good selection of drinks served quickly. Early breakfast from 4am. Good wifi and hot water, AC, large room. Would recommend for families just for the location and easy for the airport. The restaurant is big so plenty of space for our toddler to wander without getting in people’s way."

102,charlestonfarrell,2023-05-31,3.0,"Penalty Charge Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport I had an overnight stay with my wife and daughter at this hotel on 24.05.23 as we were travelling to Paris the following day. Bring from Birmingham and unfamiliar with the surroundings, I can remember slowly driving up to the hotel car park entrance and eventually gaining entry and parking in the hotel car park. Having had a lovely stay  I returned from work today only to find a penalty charge from Bristol airport stating that stopping outside the barriers of the hotel car park was unlawful and I've been summoned to pay £100. This has angered me so much and I bet I'm one of many that this had happened to, yet still the hotel didn't make any efforts to prioritise and emphasise this issu3 to its guests and I'm absolutely disgusted at this lack of communication and I for one won't be returning to this hotel in a hurry nor recommending it."

104,combatchez,2023-05-31,3.0,"Just ok We chose this hotel due to an early flight the following day. We used online check in and our phone to unlock the room door. All excellent and easy to do making it less stressful all round. 
The room on the face of it was fine, we decided to get a drink at the bar and a couple of chocolate bars, oh dear!!! The prices were horrendous…..more so for the chocolate bars, make sure you bring your own!! 
We then went back to the room to watch tv and relax, the tv was cheap and nasty……the sound quality was so bad it vibrated the whole set. We had it at such a low volume in the end we couldn’t hear what was being said. 
The sink in the bathroom had somebodies tooth paste smeared around the back of it and the shower had hairs in it. 
We did complain and we were offered another room but we declined as it was too much hassle to re pack everything just for one night. 
I just felt that maybe an offer of a free drink at the bar instead would have gone a long way and made us feel a bit more important as customers. 
All in all it was just ok, if there was another hotel to choose from I’d seriously consider it"

107,FERGVSFOOD,2023-05-31,5.0,"Can you afford not to stay here ? It's been a few years since we last stayed at the Hampton, COVID and the cost of Living crisis sharply focused the mind on what's is important.
But we finally needed a holiday and flying from Bristol there really is no sensible option.
Why would you not stay at the Hampton?
Sure you could save a few quid and drive up or stay near by and still drive up.
But honestly I can't see why you would bother.
The staff , many of them I remember from my last stay , are amazing. 
Seriously the welcome I got was worth the extra money alone.
That  all comes down from a strong management ethos.
It runs through the whole team.
Rooms are great , food a little limited, but perfectly acceptable.
Drinks overpriced, I wouldn't have expected anything else.
But the convenience, that's what you pay for.
A complimentary continental breakfast from 4 am is very welcome.
I will not stay anywhere else when I next fly from Bristol.
I don't believe I could afford not to."

113,Traveller78,2023-03-31,5.0,"A really nice hotel Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport

       We stayed at this very nice hotel the night before our flight.  Overnight parking at the hotel was £14.  The parking ticket needs to be validated at the reception, then at the payment machine next to the lifts the payment is made.  We checked in our flight hold luggage the evening before our flight, and it was a 5-to-10-minute walk to the airport terminal.  Most of the walk was in a covered walkway, up to the point where you cross the road.  Then you can either take the steps or use the sloping walkways to the terminal.

       We had a high floor room which faced the airport terminal drop off and pickup point, this made for interesting people watching.  Cold breakfast starts at 04:00 and hot food starts at 06:00.  The hotel looks to be very new, and our room was very clean, fresh, and new looking.  There is quiet air con and heating which seemed to work in a delayed manner, but it kept us at a comfortable temperature.   The room has the usual facilities; soaps, kettle, tea and coffee.  

       This is a very nice hotel to stay in, most notable points are its clean and fresh feel along with very helpful staff."

The lamp in the room didn't work but apart from that the facilities were excellent and had a very comfortable night. Breakfast was good although if your a vegetarian there aren't lots of options, I also found the orange juice very watery, perhaps there was an issue with the machine but what was on offer was nice and would definitely stay again."

116,Okhrana,2023-04-30,4.0,"Overpriced but great location We spent one night at the Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport. The hotel is conveniently located just steps from the air terminal.

Check in was smooth and we appreciated having our parking validated before taking our car rental back.

The lobby is modern and impressive, complete with comfortable seating areas, WiFi, a bar and restaurant.

Our room was very nice, spacious and clean, BUT there was NO hot water in the shower the morning we checked out! This was a great annoyance considering we paid 145.60 GBP!!

The restaurant provides a number of hot meals at affordable prices. I ordered the vegetarian curry and found it bland, the naan bread and poppadom clearly came out of a packet. My husband had the chicken parmigiana and was disappointed because it had been microwaved.

The hotel certainly had its pros and cons, however, I expected more considering it was a Hilton."

The food was lovely and just what we needed to start our holiday off. The staff were really helpful and pleasant."
123,LashyDavid,2023-02-28,2.0,"Not cheap but not classy The Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport is a fairly new hotel. It’s within easy walking distance of the terminal and breakfast is served from 4am (with hot food from 6am) for an early flight. We had a spacious room with a good shower and comfortable bed and the hard-working staff were welcoming. However, in an area very like a motorway service station, it has a very limited evening menu – sandwiches, baked potato, burger, pasta, pizza, curry – and the evening we were there, we had to queue for 20 minutes just to order. Meanwhile the automatic doors kept opening every time someone walked past, letting in the cold February air. And then things got worse. Our room was very cold and, although the air conditioning was set to 21.5 degrees, it just blew in cold air.  We could find no instructions for the controller and the bed had a very thin quilt with no extra blankets so we had to wear some of our day clothes to be warm enough to sleep.  To some extent we were unfortunate but we paid £158.65 for a booking that could not be changed or cancelled in a hotel which lacks class. This is 2 or 3 times as much as an equivalent hotel a little further away so it’s a lot extra to pay, just to be close to the airport."
124,W76QRdeborahm,2023-04-30,2.0,"Thumbs down for the breakfast The staff wasn't very nice or knowledgeable
The breakfast pack was a disaster. I had to leave for flight check-in before the breakfast was served, and had a bag with 2 old looking clementines, a pack of apple juice, a meagre croissant and a peanut bar? I could be allergic. I would have preferred no breakfast at all, but the hotel insisted because they did not want to refund the breakfast.
It was packed, and I was put in a wing full of teenager scouts going for a trip, and this because of my early checkout?
Expensive for what it is, they rely on location for price."

They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and exceeded all expectations, even bring freshly baked croissants at the end of breakfast.

129,UKtoEgypt,2023-03-31,4.0,"Great hotel for a restful nights sleep Great hotel. Just a few minutes walk from the airport terminal, really convenient. Lady on reception who checked me in was lovely, friendly welcoming and helpful. Room was a good size. The level of sound proofing was incredible! So quiet, a great place to rest before/after a flight. 

One downside was the bathroom. I appreciate that the room was fully wheelchair accessible, but the shower flooded both times it was used as the drain seems to be in the wrong place and water flows easily around the floor. Also, only accepting card payments at the bar is very inconvenient. I do not have a UK card, and wanted to avoid any additional bank charges for transactions abroad by paying in cash but this was not permitted. This should be thought about by management as I cannot be the only traveller who choses to pay in cash. Otherwise, a great stay and would recommend for a restful nights sleep."
130,Thamesbabe,2023-02-28,4.0,"Very convenient and comfortable The hotel is in the airport a few minutes walk from the terminal. You do have to negotiate some steps which can be awkward with heavy cases.
We booked a room due to a late flight arrival. The room was absolutely fine with a comfortable bed and good shower. 
The complimentary breakfast was as expected having stayed in these hotels before. 
I thought it was overpriced but as there is no choice of alternative hotels then it is what it is. 
We would happily stay again."

Louis on reception was extremely helpful and pleasant as were his colleagues. Our room was very comfortable and clean, as was the bathroom. Plenty of mirrors and good lighting.  Food was hot but I knew it would be fast food as the Americans do not excell in cuisine in the majority of their chain hotels. However it was served with a smile and was edible. On our return, very helpful staff helped my husband and explained how to pay for the parking. Altogether a very pleasant stay and so easily accessible for the airport. Will definitely stay again."

Having paid £135 for my room,I expected it to be warm and comfortable.Unfortunately,it was chilly ,even with the thermostat on max,and despite telling Reception twice ,it remained chilly.I was offered an extra duvet which arrived with a separate cover. I struggled to put it on. The only 'easy' chair in my room was not comfy and in fact the room furniture reminded me of a budget Ibis hotel.
The hotel is of course convenient for the airport,but next time I'll book into one of the local B&Bs and get a taxi to the airport."
133,chrisnB7807AO,2023-03-31,2.0,"A rip off Slightly inferior to the average Premier inn at three times the price of b&b for two! Give it a miss unless you really need to stay at the airport.

134,Beachandsea,2023-03-31,4.0,"Enjoyable overnight, but cold room and average breakfast Welcoming staff, with extra  help at breakfast from Graham and Laura.. Room very clean and well equipped, with no external noise -  but was cold on arrival and took a while to warm up. Bed very comfortable with fine linen. Walk in shower and shower gel excellent.  Breakfast was good, but scrambled egg was a bit dried out and tasteless.  We were being collected after breakfast and driver had no problem having his  parking ticket  validated by reception staff for free exit ( they allow 1 hr for such short visits ). Very convenient for airport. We around £149.00 for one night.

Tip : If coming off a flight with extra luggage, eg ski or ski boot bags as well as  suit cases, it is worth paying £ 2 for a trolley at baggage arrival and you can then get to the hotel easier via gradual lowering pathways, across  from the  airport exit.  If you are going to a flight with extra bags, it may be worth going up to the airport  car park first where, like we did when going on holiday , and found a number of trolleys left by others - and didn't have to pay for one !"
135,wendyhowieson,2023-03-31,4.0,"Excellent for the Airport Stayed at this hotel on the 25th February for a next day flight.  Went to Reception to be greeted by the absolutely lovely Chelsey who greeted us with the most beautiful smile.  She was amazing, thanked me for me a Hilton Honours member, described everything in detail and told us to come straight back to her if anything was unsatisfactory.  Chelsey is an assess to the hotel. Room was clean, lovely towels,adequate space, safe,comfortable beds.  Food in the evening was fine, the usual quick meals, if you want anything other than that then this is not the place for you, after all this is an airport hotel. Breakfast was nice, quite a choice but be nice to have some tomato.  Cannot fault the night we spent there before our flight.

We stayed on our return on the 5th March.  We checked in at 12.30 pm and our greeting was so different.  No happy Chelsey, we were greeting with a chap (didn't get his name) who never even smiled and the only thing he asked was our name which I had to give him 3 times before it registered with him.  He handed us our room key and still did not speak. I asked what time breakfast was as we seemed to think it changed in the week.  He told us it was until 11.00 am.  I queried this with him 4 times but he still said 11.00 am.  We thought as we were late in we would sleep in a bit so we went to breakfast at 9.30 only to be told breakfast finished at 10.00.  At 9.50 am breakfast was being taken away. We were not happy as we like to enjoy our breakfast and not have to rush it down.

I would have given this hotel 5 stars but the chap on reception lost them the extra star, nevertheless I would still stay at this hotel.  I do hope though that this member of staff is spoken to."
136,homebrew_author,2023-03-31,4.0,"Good but car park & breakfast were problems The sign posted car park rates are truly horrendous.

£5 to drop guests off at the hotel, at pricing for room there should be no need to try and fleece them for simply getting out of a car.

That said reception staff were great and we validated ticket which appeared to get our parents out without charge.

Why not just allow a drop off in a their secure car park without the hassle.

Room was very clean but also very chilly. I do wish hotels would warm room prior to guest arriving, we've paid for it.

Bathroom was clean with lovely shower.

Be warned.... If on an early checkout you might not get the breakfast you paid for. We asked and we were told take out bags for breakfast would be available. Got down at 04:10 and told sorry no breakfast available to go.

A lovely clean corporate hotel with great staff but if you're on an early flight I'd recommend trying one of local guest houses within 800m. You'll pay less for room which means you'll have extra cash to pay for the breakfast you'll be forced to buy at the airport."

Overbright reception staff, appalling impersonal room, the much-vaunted breakfast had excellent bacon, but dry hash browns, tasteless scrambled eggs and some black stuff they claimed was coffee but wasn't.

Worst of all, and adding insult to injury, was the fact that you had to,pay a rip-off extra £5  just to drive to the front door; at reception when leaving the next morning, I heard two reception staff laughing over the fact  that some poor person had got stung for an extra £40.

It would work for cattle and sheep but the fare is limited and fairly awful. This is NOT fine dining but equally it is not what truckers would accept in a transport cafe. My cheesburger with chips was some form of processed meat which had clearly been overcooked and burnt at the edges several times before, had no taste and was tepid at best. The cheese slice which had been added was soft but not melted. The the chips were good. The staff appears to have little culinary trainihg and warm offerings are microwaved on demand. Guests are a captive audience because, apart from the airport terminal, there is nowhere else to go. It is more than disappointing that Hilton lends it name to this  disappointing monument to accountancy greed."
152,BrixhamColey,2023-01-31,4.0,Another good stay. Good clean and nice rooms. Rooms appear quite well soundproofed for an airport hotel with coming and going at all hours. Food satisfying and freshly cooked. Easy check in and out process. All staff very helpful  and friendly. Easy access from airport and the silver zone parking on site.  Will be using on a regular basis now.
153,bobeE5738VW,2023-01-31,4.0,"Can't Fault Accommodation Lovely treception staff, nice modern hotel on airport, great rooms. If room not warn enough contact reception as they can increase individually. Cannot fault this place except for the evening meals.... in fairness the burger was fine but there is a complete lack of choice...burger, curry, pizza that's about it apart from sandwiches etc.... missing out big time on proper meals which has not changed in years. But....still a great place to stay for the convenience and accommodation and staff."
154,travel4love88,2023-01-31,4.0,"Very good, great staff Booked for a 1 night stay, minutes from airport, room was bright clean and very good, staff are very friendly and helpful, plenty of choice with breakfast although some items weren’t the warmest, decent shower and good toiletries, I must say £129 for one does seem a bit steep, overall a decent stay"
155,Z6321LErichards,2022-12-31,3.0,"Convenient but overpriced Great location, however that’s where the advantage ends, room cost, menu cost,  parking costs all at a premium level, a shame the experience does not live up to the expectation.
Evening menu choice poor , order at the bar and pay before eating, wait for ever even when not busy, just like a motorway services, except here the room was over £150 a night!
Parking for one night additional to the room cost, it’s not a city centre location, we were told they have to charge so much  as it’s part of their agreement with the airport! Well let’s just pass it on to the customer then!"
156,GMLLoyd,2023-01-31,3.0,"Could be better The bottom sheet did not fit the bed. The duvet was thin and there were no extra blankets. I expected better from this chain.

We parked at the short stay car park the night before and it was a simple 5 min walk to the hotel from here then straight to the airport again in the morning. Continental breakfast was from 4.30 too.

Nice breakfast
Room a bit small for luggage but other than that good value for money.

Sldo right next to the air port so easy to get into Bristol air port the next day.

Other bonus is that breakfast starts from 4am."
159,Amanda23-Scotland,2022-12-31,3.0,"Could be better  I was a bit disappointed with this hotel as I have used this brand before and it was amazing.

Our family room was very small felt almost claustrophobic as the child's bed was so close to the bigger bed. And it was so worn out it really dipped in the middle therefore an uncomfortable sleep.

Breakfast was also disappointing well below expectations.

Staff where friendly and approachable.

It's literally just across the road from airport but I would drive that little bit and choose another hotel."
160,AnnaT991,2022-12-31,5.0,"Would recommend! We stayed here prior to our flight in early December, I can’t recommend it enough, so close to the airport and a really nice comfortable hotel to stay, breakfast was included which was really good, plenty to choose from. Will definately book again if flying from Bristol airport!"
161,workingtitle,2022-12-31,5.0,Exactly what we needed Perfect location for our early morning flight the next day. Staff are all welcoming and friendly. Really comfortable beds and room was spotlessly clean. We enjoyed a light evening meal and breakfast was freshly made with good choice. Just what we needed.
162,stuartw800,2022-12-31,3.0,"Nice hotel, terrible food offering Hotel review first of all, great check in experience, very friendly staff, rooms are to a good standard and nice amenities. Same staff member checked me out and was brilliant.

Food offering is terrible. Dinner is a folded A4 menu, limited choice and nothing better than pre made, overpriced and poorly presented food. Stood in a constant queue of 8 and more to order just like a Wetherspoons, after food you need to I’ve on and order drink separately. Food was appalling quality at dinner and same experience at breakfast. Lukewarm food, poor quality food, dirty uncleared tables, bins were filthy and shocked at how bad the hygiene was

In summary, hotel is great, food is very poor verging on a joke, for a Hilton and the prices charged they should and must do better. Food service completely lets this hotel down"
163,richieh102018,2022-12-31,4.0,"Great for early morning flight Stayed here for the night before a flight from Bristol airport.

Very nice hotel looks as though maybe recently refurbish (or kept to a very high standard)

Staff are friendly and the food was nice. 

Strange that when you check in you have to authorise your card at that point to later put food and drinks into your room (which we didn’t do). It just means that each time you order food or drinks you have to pay there and then which isn’t the end of the world but is a bit annoying all the same. A good night sleep, comfy bed, 5 mins walk to the airport… perfect.

Only thing to be aware of is that the parking is controlled by the airport not the hotel, you get a discounted rate the night you stay (£14 instead of £20 or something like this)  which I found a little off as other Hilton’s I’ve used offer a park and fly rate which this hotel would definitely benefit from being able to offer."
164,markhP7403DK,2022-12-31,1.0,"Dirty and unwelcoming The room was very cold to begin with and after a few calls and an email it was turned on … unable to alter the heating as it was overridden by reception I was told.  If it gets too hot I was to call reception to reduce the heat …… takes a while to get reception to answer.
Headed down to the restaurant which was the Concourse area ….. tried three tables and all were sticky and one had hair stuck to it. Menu was either burgers or curry …… or a sandwich….. sandwich came out and was thin cheap bread and not even buttered …. Seven pounds …. Waiter was very friendly and professional.  There was queuing system with barriers at the bar where you have to order your food and drinks …. After a wait I was served by an unfriendly female member of staff … ordered the food and a drink … was given a place located and told to come back for the drink … it will be placed on the bar when ready.  Awful experience."
165,Carlaconsort,2022-12-31,5.0,"Utilitarian Appearance Shields Good Comfort Within Exemplary service from the reception staff, as at very short notice had to book another room since wife was stranded in that joke of an airport Dublin ( three days to get from Dublin to Bristol must be some sort of record ! ). Which they did in a matter of minutes; excellent service. First room functional comfort, clean and tidy, with a large comfortable bed. Commendably quiet too so a good night's kip assured. Second room of equally good standard - 362 has a ginormous telly by the way which was an entertaining diversion. Breakfast a most acceptable serve yourself affair with a good range of options, cooked from six am onwards, no limits set as what you can have. Evening meal  also enjoyable and not too pricey, with staff attentive and helpful. All in all a well run staging post very well situated a few minutes from arrivals and departures. Just be aware   that parking is a tad expensive, so make sure to get parking validated at reception on checking out."
166,suzieNorthumberland,2022-12-31,5.0,"Better than expected Wasn’t expecting much for an on-airport hotel but was pleasantly surprised. The room was well designed to maximise use of the space and had comfortable 120cm wide beds and an excellent shower.
Breakfast was OK buffet style, with cooked breakfast available from 6am. Didn’t try the evening offering.
Special shout out to Alex Wall. My husband has limited mobility and airport assistance can only be pre-booked within the terminal itself. Alex arranged for OCS to transfer me to the terminal from the hotel reception and also arranged for his reception staff to confirm the arrangements a couple of hours ahead. Everything went smoothly on the day with no stress.
Only negative was that the room was very cold when we arrived and took a couple of hours to warm up."
167,katie19842015,2022-11-30,5.0,"Great hotel, Great food, Perfect for the Airport! Me and my husband stayed here either side of our Cyprus holiday in November. Check in was easy both times, and both rooms were perfect. 

We ate lunch and evening meal at the first stay and used the 24 hour menu, and breakfast at the second. All food was lovely, and bearing in mind you're in an airport hotel, and a Hilton, the food wasn't expensive.

All the staff we encountered were very pleasant and really helpful! Overall 2 lovely stays. Thankyou very much!!"
168,grapow,2022-12-31,2.0,"Nice room, good staff but that’s where it went downhill! First the good news, the room itself was fine, in fact to a high standard but so it should at the prices they charge, more than €150 per night! And the staff were excellent!
Our main gripe was the restaurant process, a queue to order and pay and then a different queue for the drinks . However what pushed our patience beyond the limit were groups of young kids running around the tables screaming and generally out of control. I must ask, why don’t the hotel put out a message asking parents to control them. This relegated the hotel to the same level as an Ibis, in fact it wouldn’t be tolerated at an Ibis!"

170,YachtSuzannah,2022-11-30,3.0,Great location average rest Location brilliant right opposite terminal.  Very modern but cold both in hotel temperature and atmosphere.   Not made to feel welcome.  Cold and clinical lounge area with airport style lane queuing system for bar and food service.   Feels just like an airport lounge.   Too stark.  No real restaurant just huge open ground floor.   Won’t return.      Off airport and taxi next time
171,Jimmyrn85,2022-11-30,2.0,"Food is awful, not good value for money Accommodation is clean and to a high standard. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the food. 

Poor choice, poor quality food that is just microwaved rubbish, yet has the price tag of much better restaurants like ones found in Premier Inn. 

Based on how poor the dining experience is, I won’t stay here again."
172,Breakswiththelakes,2022-11-30,5.0,"Thank you Lauren! I wanted to say a special thank you to Lauren, who made our stay extra special. We stayed the night before travelling to Disneyland Paris with lots of kids and adults. The room had a mini treasure hunt with Disney characters and the kids LOVED it- so thank you so much. Everything was clean, organised and the staff are amazing. Short walk to the airport."
173,Messyplay,2022-10-31,4.0,"Ideally located There is literally only one negative about this hotel, so I will start there. It is very expensive. We paid nearly £300 for one night with parking in Silver Zone for one week (for two adults sharing).
The hotel is right next to the airport; on the same site really. This makes it very convenient, especially if you have an early flight like we did.
There is a good choice of food for an evening meal and it’s not extortionate. Very tasty too (I had the falafel burger and fries; my husband had the curry). 
All of the staff are very friendly, chatty and help in any way they can. 
The rooms are spacious and have everything you need including shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, body lotion and so on. Also tea and coffee in the room, which is an essential for me as I can’t function without a cuppa when I wake up, especially when the alarm is set for 03:30!
The bed was comfortable. 
The entire hotel is immaculately clean. 
Breakfast is included in the price and starts at 4am. There was fresh tea and coffee, bread for hot toast, cereals, pastries, fresh fruit, yoghurt, muffins and fruit juice. If you didn’t have time to eat it all, there are paper bags to put it in to take to the airport, as well as paper cups with lids for your hot drink. 
If you need to check out before 4am, you can just pick up a bag with a simple breakfast to take to the airport. 
Cooked breakfast starts at 6am, but I can’t comment on that as we checked out at 04:20.
Despite the high price, we would definitely stay there again if we have an early flight from Bristol."
174,BecciGlos,2022-10-31,4.0,"Another great stay night before an early flight Another excellent stay at this hotel (early morning flight from Bristol). Check in was warm, as usual they allowed us to drop off luggage before moving our car to airport parking. Room was fine, sofa bed all set up for our daughter, all immaculately clean especially bathroom. Restaurant / bar is big and spacious. Drinks highly priced but good. Service friendly and efficient. Food as always is just ok and the menu is quite limited however it is fairly priced. Slept well, considering there must be so many comings and going’s there is never any noise. We left a little later than usual and was surprised at 4am there was a continental breakfast out Inc coffees and takeaway cups etc. When we’ve checked out at 3 in the past we’ve had a breakfast bag. Rooms are highly priced however this is the only hotel on the airport site. It’s worth it especially if you’re flying with jet2 to drop off luggage night before as part of their twilight service and then just walk (literally couple of minutes) to security next morning. We just treat it as another night of holiday. Only reason not 5 star are prices and evening meal quality."
175,Amykidd84,2022-11-30,2.0,"Disappointed We booked this hotel as had a early flight the next morning with my two young children.
Easy to find , clear instructions and very close to the terminal.
Upon entering our room we noted it appeared dirty / food under the bed.  
We then left the room to find “ housekeeping “ running and chasing each other with what appeared to be the  linen trolley . This likely explained the poor state of our room.
We informed staff at reception whom were polite and apologetic and ensured us the room would be cleaned straight away .
Food in the restaurant was very nice and generous portions.
Upon returning to the room we noted the sofa bed to be hard and uncomfortable- we addressed this at the time and were told that all the rooms are the same . The only option we had was to possibly book and pay for another room . Having just paid £280 we felt this was totally unacceptable . 
The location of this hotel is great , but sadly I don’t. Think with the experience we have had we would stay here again . The staff could have done more to make our stay enjoyable - but it appears they do not care ."

Who would have thought a sea view ( well Bristol Chanel ) walking to the room which was clean, fresh and airy. Returned early very early from our holiday ,yet again brilliant check in welcoming staff and service also added to the Hilton benefit’s of a English breakfast followed by a few hours undisturbed sleep wake up to relaxing shower then onward home. I have to say less is more. Our 5 star vacation didn’t meet up with our outward and return experience with Hamptons."

We had a lovely, warm, informative welcome from Alex.
Spotless, comfortable room, couldn't hear any plane noise,  but did hear other people leaving to catch their flights,  understandably.
Quieter, shutting doors would have helped.
I used the fitness centre, which was located on the 1st floor, a nice facility.
Fabulous choice for breakfast at 4am and well presented.
Check out was easy, just leave the key at the front desk. 
Really close to the airport,  5 min walk,made things so much easier for us in the morning and also for booking in the luggage the night before.
Thoroughly recommended. 
A really enjoyable stay, thank you."

The second was having to pay £3 for a cheap toothbrush and a miniscule tube of toothpaste, actual buying cost probably 25p.

The third was having to sign for the above item!

The fourth was finding breakfast sausages cooked with sugar: yeech!

The fifth was having to pay £14.50 for overnight parking - a scandal for a hotel of this supposed class."

Our flight was delayed so didn’t get to the hotel until 5.15am and totally exhausted in need of sleep, given our room key and made our way to the room- when we walked in the bed was unmade and the remote control was lying on the unmade bed and there were wet towels all on the floor! 
So after a long and delayed flight I had to go back down to reception and ask if that is definitely our room as it’s dirty! The gentleman laughed and said I’m sorry that room was supposed to be cleaned and give us another room.

Hotel was really easy to find and plenty of parking available in the Hotel car park (although for a fee). Room was comfortable and clean which is all you can ask for! Breakfast was okay, nothing fancy just a regular self service English breakfast plus the usual continental options. Tables in the didning area could’ve done with a bit of attention, wiping down etc after each person. 

Also, bought two glasses of wine in the bar the night before and it came to just over £14! Might be because I’m a northerner and used to cheaper prices but it did seem a bit over the top!

We left the room at about 3.30am so you could say was it worth it, but we definitely think so, had an early night so still had good nights sleep. To us it much more preferable to driving up that time of the morning! 
Everything about our stay was great. Room was immaculate, bed very comfy. We had a meal in the hotel that was very good. 
There was an option to take a breakfast bag they were left on reception but we didn’t . Think they contained a pain au chocolat, cereal bar and juice. Can’t remember the other item.

191,DevonAdorable,2022-09-30,4.0,"Perhaps overpriced but convenient Location close to departure but it is uphill to reach the departure area so for some may be a struggle with a heavy case.
Reception staff pleasant & helpful.
Room clean BUT reception area & dining area needed more attention.  Sadly the carpet was quite stained.
Hot breakfast disappointing, bacon was dry even though breakfast had only just started.
The plus is avoiding driving on the day of departure.
For the price, poor coffee & tea selection in room & no shower cap.
I think it is overpriced for what it offers & when compared with other hotels in the group in similar locations.
Reading this I would put it at 3 out of 5 but give it a 4 because of its location.
HINT if TV says check aerial connection it may be that housekeeping in ‘tidying’ up the wiring have inadvertently pulled out the aerial connection to be found under the shelf on which the TV sits."

I was looking for alternatives because the parking (I chose the multi-storey) and two rooms for a night came at a price. Well let me say I found no viable alternative so am delighted to report that not only is it the best location, but we had a great welcome at check in. We were able to order food and drinks when we arrived and the two twin rooms were great. Perfectly clean and just what we asked for. In fact these were the best beds that we had the pleasure to sleep in during the trip. Breakfast is perfectly adequate and included in the price. We also saw a number of (Alpro) dairy free options so really felt well catered for. All in all it really is the best choice.

We hadn't pre booked parking as the hotel appeared to state you can park there for £8 a night however, this is only if you are staying in the hotel and not for the duration of your holiday, even if upon return you intend to stay in the hotel. Luckily, the man on reception was very warm, welcoming and friendly and explained my error and what was my best option moving forward. 
As for the room itself, the cot bed requested was already prepared in the room and it was a good size with a nice lounger chair and a big bed. The amenities were so very basic and no mini fridge. It was pleasantly quiet and no disruptions to the little ones (some hotels just have no regard for noise control, but this one certainly did) we even had a wave from the window from the man changing the flags which was very nice. There aren't any luggage trolleys within close proximity, for this, you need to go to the airport itself and pay for a trolley and take it to your parked car at the hotels car parking. We then moved the car to the multi storey parking. The hotel and multi storey are in close proximity of each other and a short walk to departures. 

All in all, a nice hotel and basic room, but certainly not what one might expect from a 'Hilton' hotel, it compares more to a Travelodge."

Decent bar and bar food. Great welcoming and helpful staff. A super start to your holiday and only a 5 min walk into the (chaotic) terminal. Glad we stayed the night before our 6am flight. CAn’t go wrong staying here but dont expect a vacation type hotel - this is functional and very good at what it does. Would definitely stay here again."

Delighted to find coffee and a fee breakfast items and 5am!
No complaints at all and an overall great experience For the purpose."
207,PDC1290,2022-07-31,3.0,"Poor standards - from checkin to cleanliness I have stayed in this hotel quite a few times on trips in and out of Bristol airport. The reception staff do not even look up to greet incoming clients, look a little scruffy in their appearance, take an inordinate amount of time to checkin, even when prebooked using the HH app, and read out the room numbers out loud when handing over the room card - which I reprimanded one lad for in the name of security risk (he questioned why it was a problem, which indicates they have received no training on customer security and wellbeing).  The rooms are functional, with a tea maker but no bottled water (supposedly offered to Honors clients, but not available apparently), and have a sliding door to either close the bathroom or close the wardrobe but not both! Going to breakfast, one walks past Reception - again where not one staff looks up or volunteers a cheery good morning - through a canteen style dining area to a corner breakfast room which is milling with ground crew staff piling high their plates as breakfast is obviously offered to them.  Overall, this hotel is convenient for late or early flights, but otherwise could not recommend."
208,staceyrB7561AX,2022-07-31,4.0,"Super convenient Our room was tiny - we booked a double with a sofa bed and a cot, there was hardly any room to move.

209,r2d21,2022-07-31,1.0,"Worst Hampton Experience We stayed at the hotel prior to our departure and again on our return and on both occasions where totally disappointed with our experience.

At check in as Hilton Honors members  we asked for the complimentary water  to be told  they don't do this in Bristol.   Strange how they do in all other Hampton's we have stayed in.

 The seating areas in the lobby and the dining area are very uninviting no comfortable seats apart from just 2 coffee tables with  armchairs close to the main entrance.     

With regards to dining the food menu is limited  poor.  We decided on our pre departure stay to order a portion of potato wedges we where informed that they where not available only french fries.  Having agreed to the alternative when they where served we where then told they had no ketchup what hotel does not have ketchup.  On our second stay one week later we decided in the evening to order the wedges surprise surprise sorry not available only fries.

Moving on to breakfast OK but no where near the standard of other Hampton hotels.  In the breakfast buffet area there are  2 coffee machines on our stay prior to departure one was out of order OK things do brake down.  However, again when we returned one week later the coffee machine was still out of order.  

With regards to cleanliness this again is lacking at breakfast we sat down in the dining area and our plates stuck to the table.  Totally unacceptable.

Having previously stayed in The Hampton at both Liverpool and Stanstead Airports where we'd have no hesitation in returning Bristol was far below what we had expected.  Blaming the current situations is not an acceptable excuse as only this year we have stayed 4 times in Stanstead and have received impeccable service and would recommend the hotel to anyone.  Hampton Bristol unless we had  no option we would not stay there again.  The hotel is way below standard."
210,dogloverkate,2022-07-31,3.0,"Pre flight stay We were flying out very early the next morning so to minimise stress we got dropped off her the other side of the barriers.  Checked in & then did the night before bag drop. Highly recommend this as it's carnage in the early morning. Straight thru security & all the shops are open at 4am  

Food at hotel was v poor & the service chaotic. If you come prepared for mediocre you will be fine. Reception team excellent. Lots of rookie staff but that's OK. Well done for working.

Upon arrival we were told that the IT system was down & they had no record of which rooms had already been allocated & which were free.

We were told to take a seat & someone would be over to talk to us when everything was up and running. As everyone was in the same boat, the queue at the bar was enormous and the servers were going at a snails pace. 

We eventually got our food & drink (which was hot & delicious) and we waited, and we waited. 

We saw that people were once again forming a queue at check in so we guessed that the situation had been resolved - no one had  come round to speak to us & keep us updated. We eventually got into our hotel room just after 10pm. 

We had wanted a really early night as we had to up up again at 3am for our flight - this was an expensive night in a hotel that didn't live up to our expectations at all."

Our rooms were a good size, especially the bathroom. 
Dinner was slightly lacking in food and drink options but the breakfast more than made up for it.
Situated close to the airport which is exactly what we wanted, the only issue we had was the £5 fee just to drop off which took less than 5 minutes.
Check out was posting your card.

Fantastic service from all staff, if we fly from Bristol again then we will definitely be staying again."

due to us being delayed coming home they decided to put us down as a no show meaning we got charged £185, but when we checked in they reinstated the booking meaning another £185 was taken but they also decided to take £247 which is there on the day fee, when i spoke to the person on reception she couldn't see why this had happened and couldn't advise me what to do, so i took matters into my own hands and phoned the bank to stop 2 of the payments, on checking out we spoke to the manager who actually was really helpful and even went into the sales team to also reverse the payments, word of advice is basically don't turn up late"
216,tomsX188PK,2022-06-30,3.0,"They’re having a laugh! Because of the airport chaos at the moment we decided to book a room for the night we were returning from a holiday in Cyprus as the flight was scheduled to arrive late at night and we planned to drive to our home in the North east the following day. The B&B rate was around £300 which we thought was a bit steep, but we had no choice as there were only a few rooms left. Fortunately my wife had let them know that we might arrive after midnight and the room was available when we eventually arrived (after a 5 hour flight delay and 2.5 hours wait for our luggage) at 4.30 am! Another couple who had not so informed reception found their room had dropped off the system and was no longer available, although after a lot of whispering and shuffling about by the reception staff, they were eventually accommodated. 
The room was quite small but comfortable, although by the time we got in we only had time for a shower, a short rest and breakfast before setting off on the home journey. 
Considering the price, the breakfast was not wonderful. The buffet was OK and offered a fair choice of items, Although the croissants were dry and hard as if they were several days old!
I had expected an airport hotel to be more prepared for people turning up at odd times. Although the reception staff eventually delivered the goods they did seem to be quite taken aback by people turning up several hours late to take up their booked accommodation. The IT system should take some responsibility for this as it appeared that guests who turned up after midnight without prior warning, were automatically removed as “non- shows”
Overall we felt the experience was less than we had expected from Hilton and was expensive for what was on offer."
217,Hazzarch,2022-06-30,5.0,"Lovely Little Hotel for The Airport! Me and my fiancé stayed here as we had an early flight the next morning.

We'd never been to a Hilton hotel before so weren't sure what to expect apart from a semi-upper tier hotel.

The man on reception that checked us in was very chatty and made us feel quite comfortable which was great. I had originally setup the remote room key on my phone but had to reset the device before arriving at the hotel, unfortunately it didn't give me permission to use it due to it ""being a different device"" but it wasn't the end of the world.

The room itself was spotless and had very good sound dampening, I don't think we heard a single plane from the outside and not even anyone in the corridor when we were trying to sleep which was very good, when we had to be up at about 3am for a 6.45am flight.

Overall, this hotel was worth the money when I had to drive about an hour and a half to get to the airport, so it prevented us from being worn out and stressed for when our holiday started."
218,RachelS2086,2022-06-30,5.0,"Clean, comfortable hotel with fab breakfast choice and good staff The hotel was ideally situated by the airport after a late arrival. Drinks abs a small menu available, we had sandwiches freshly made with a salad and crisps, very tasty. Staff friendly and fun.
The rooms beautifully clean and comfortable with tea and coffee facilities.
The breakfast choice was amazing, all lovely. We had a cooked bree with  juice and coffee, also a Danish pastry on the side, yum!
Great hotel, highly recommend"
219,MrHandBaggageOnly,2022-05-31,4.0,"Great For An Early Flight We stayed here for one night before an early flight and had a good stay. This hotel has the standard old style HbH rooms, but they are well soundproofed and we had a decent night’s sleep. 

We appreciated that it is only a five minute walk to the terminal and we also like the fact that although cooked breakfast doesn’t start until later, you can still access some of the continental choice very early in the morning, so you do not miss out totally on breakfast with an early flight.

When we checked in, the bar and restaurant were busy, but we were checked in quickly and efficiently, although it wasn’t overly friendly. The bar area is fine for relaxing, although as with most HbH, the selection of drinks is standard and not very exciting. You are also quite captive here as there is nowhere else to go (other than M&S in the airport terminal).

We will be staying here again soon before another early flight."
220,Gnomie1,2022-06-30,5.0,"Hotel and parking We stayed the night as we had an early flight the next morning. We were a little anxious about the airport as it was just as the media were hyping up the queues and chaos. We dropped our car and arrived at the hotel. We were greeted by a really friendly lady on reception who couldn’t have been more helpful. The room was clean, spacious and well kept. We went down to the bar for a bite to eat. The food wasn’t earth shattering but it was tasty, hot and decent portions, a little pricey but to be expected in an airport hotel. The menu is not extensive but we didn’t have any problems with choosing. The restaurant was very busy but the staff were all friendly and smiling! We received a breakfast bag the next morning from the reception desk as we were leaving early. It was ok…….a croissant, a cereal bar, banana and a carton of orange juice. Maybe not the best but certainly enough to take the edge off before our flight and as an ‘on the move’ snack, it did the job. We would certainly consider using the hotel again if we fly out of Bristol. 
We also had silver parking at the airport as part of the package. This was very well organised!(we had read bad reports just before we went so we’re anticipating problems…). You drive in, find a parking space and take note of the bay number. In the office you input your booking, including where you are parked, drop your keys and off you go to the shuttle bus. The staff member who was in there was really friendly and helpful. The shuttle bus runs every 15 mins and within 2-3 mins you are at the airport! The return was just as easy and straightforward."
221,helenwH199DJ,2022-06-30,2.0,"Disappointed The first person on reception who  spoke to us was very rude, made us feel really uncomfortable and unwelcome, really bed customer service.
Felt like the money we spent on a nights stay  we would of been made more welcome on arrival.
The evening staff at the bar didn’t have a clue what they were doing and a few people were a bit annoyed with their service.
Breakfast was a take away because of the time we had to leave that was very disappointing.
Will not recommend or be returning.
This was the beginning of our holiday so really glad we were treated a lot better in Lanzarote."
222,haribo2016,2022-06-30,3.0,"Good hotel but...... We booked a connecting room, was able to check day before after 6am and apparently choose a room, didn't work no rooms showing not even on day of booking, so made our way to hotel to be pleasantly suprised to have ground floor rooms. Room was clean and spacious. No conditioner in the shower so had to get some from other room. Now dinner, so i ordered a burger whilst i enjoyed the bbq sauce with it i found the burger bland, also it was very over priced for what it was cost over £80 for 4 main meals, 4 drinks (non alcohlic) and 3 deserts. I found the digital keys were annoying and didnt work so requested proper keys. Was suprised to find that they did continental breakfast from 4am so was ideal as thought we would miss breakfast completly. Check out was easy with card deposit box. Would i stay again maybe as was very conveniently located opposite the multi storey car park and not far from the terminal."

224,bigtiddygothmum,2022-06-30,2.0,"Feels a bit like extortion I had to stay here because my flight was going at 6am and I needed to be at the airport early with my two children. This meant we had to be up at 3am and as a result it was very important we got a good night's sleep as soon as possible. We arrived around 8.40pm and another customer told me there had been an issue with ""the system"" and no-one had been checked in for hours. Thankfully people did start getting checked in shortly after we arrived but of course there was a backlog. After travelling by train and bus to get here with two small children they were in no mood to be patient and wrangling them during the wait was trying. One of the receptionists did get my children a glass of water each for which I was thankful, but apart from that there was not even acknowledgement or apology for the situation they were in let alone any kind of compensation for a room that had cost over £200 for what would in the end be 7hrs of total occupancy. 

The room itself was fairly standard for what you'd expect at a chain hotel, if I'd have stayed longer I'd be disappointed at the lack of bath but I wasn't going to have time for that anyway. My children took the double bed and I took the sofa bed and I regret the choice, the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable for an adult, but might be fine for a child. 

I get that a hotel like this can survive fine on the convenience of it's location but I don't think it does the brand much good as a whole that it was overall just a really mediocre experience. I've never stayed at a Hampton before but it doesn't make me feel like I'd choose it over a different option and certainly not a cheaper one of the budget chains."
225,Lindylou146,2022-06-30,3.0,"Ok for the airport A little confusing at the entrance to the hotel car park as we only wanted do a drop off before parking in the multi storey car park . We thought there was a charge as there were barriers but apparently you can drive in and get your ticket validated at the desk for one hour free. There was a long queue at check in which seemed to take ages. But the girl was pleasant and friendly and explained everything. Our rooms were together as requested and they all had sofa beds made up although we didn’t need them in all rooms. It was certainly adequate for one night before flying and even had a safe. Soap and shampoo pumps were provided in the bathroom and there was a hairdryer. Tea and coffee also. The bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable and was too close to the bathroom wall on one side so making it difficult for my husband to get in and out of bed ! The room was quiet until people started moving between 3-4 am. 
We had an evening meal which was served fairly quickly considering it was busy and the food was just ok. My husband found the cheese and ham panini rather dry and boring but it was served with a salad and chips. My chicken tikka was nice but had a soggy popadom . There were quite a few other choices including jacket potatoes and burgers. 
We didn’t hang around over breakfast as we had to get over to the airport which was about a ten minute walk away through an undercover walkway which only lasted a short distance so not so good if raining! In all it served a purpose but not cheap for one night at £152!"
226,Irmani,2022-06-30,5.0,"Lovely staff, comfortable rooms We arrived on a late flight from Portugal with a particular room booked which we had done through a third party booking service (queen). The hotel was clearly very busy and we were put into a room with twin double beds. This was not ideal and we asked the receptionist if it was possible to have the room we had booked. She moved us to a much nicer room (same footprint but better layout which meant I could share a bed with my husband!).

This was a real 5/5 from us because despite an initial problem the really kind and professional receptionist went out of her way to fix it, and also comped us a couple of drinks which was unexpected and massively appreciated. It has made me much more likely to choose this chain again, knowing that a small hiccup will be dealt with nicely. 

Great staff. Room was comfortable and well proportioned and I like the fact that the toiletries are in dispensers so less plastic waste! The bar was lovely as well with really nice common areas to relax. Late night bar staff were charming and friendly. Well done Hilton!"

Hotel food are restaurant prices, but not restaurant quality. I am an average build, but had to order 2x meals of chilli con carne and 2 baked potatoes. The double portion of chilli con carne was minuscule and I complained. In fairness another portion was brought out to me at no additional cost. I ordered a pint of beer and onion rings too. Please be aware that my extra portion of chilli con carne came in a 11 x 5 cm ram-akin dish which is less than 300 ml of sauce and meat. My overall bill was £28.13. I begrudge having to pay for two meals and I don’t feel like I have eaten well. The chef, who was very polite ,informed me that the portion sizes are not determined by him. In future I feel like eating before staying the night before a flight at this hotel. I am a Hilton Diamond member too. Overall I do not feel that I have received good value for money, but that Hilton is trying to recoup the money lost during the COVID lockdown. I am very disappointed."

233,ElCowboy2008,2022-05-31,1.0,"Awful. Don’t be fooled by the name ‘Hilton’ Very overpriced , very poor customer service, very expensive and poor restaurant.

Arrived late on a Saturday afternoon. Went to our room to discover the room had not even been cleaned, the bed was left as it was from the previous guests their bed sheets left on the floor. The cleaners who were wondering aimlessly around the corridor didn’t seem to be at all interested in our complaint and were passing the blame onto each other before continuing to chat among themselves doing as little as possible which seems to be what they’re best at. 
We went to reception to be given another room, no help moving our luggage or even a gesture to compensate  such as a free drink or a meal but then we remembered where we were. Hampton by Hilton which is a euphemism for abysmal customer service. Don’t be fooled by the name “Hilton” this is a no frills hotel at premium prices trying to be something that it isn’t. On that day we also enjoyed the pleasure of no running water for quite a while unable to flush toilets, wash or have a drink for some time. Thankfully running water was restored later. 
The rooms have showers but there’s no proper shower door so very soon shower/ toilet room floor becomes like a lake flooded with splashed water! 

Food. The restaurant is more like a canteen only cold and not very comfortable. No table service or welcoming waiters, instead you queue up for highly over priced snacks on a very limited menu. Over £15 for a starter consisting of little chicken bits, chips and a pint of beer! Again providing as little as possible for very high prices. You’re better off eating before you arrive or bringing a packed lunch!
We had a very early flight and normally they should provide bags for a take away breakfast. Breakfast is included in the price but they ran out of bags so we did without which is obviously a great help to this place as they save food which helps with their mission to do as little as possible for very high prices. So we left hungry to venture into the bedlam of Bristol airport with its  chaos and infamously long queues. 

The only good thing is it’s relative proximity to the airport but that’s about all. Not worth the money! 

Seriously do not be fooled by the name ‘Hilton’ this place is the pits!"
234,tirol94,2022-06-30,1.0,"Convenient Don’t be fooled by the name Hilton We stayed overnight at this hotel because of an early flight the next morning.
The only good thing about this hotel is the convenience being on the airport. Unfortunately, it stops there. Don’t be fooled by the name ‘Hilton’
We arrived at approx. 4pm we had 2 rooms booked, I asked about breakfast the next morning because of our early departure, I was told to collect a breakfast bag from reception the following morning.

We arrived into our rooms and ours hadn’t been made it up, it was disgusting.  I went into the corridor and there were about 4 housekeeping staff doing nothing, 
I mentioned the room to them, they just shrugged and didn’t appear interested.  Then they started arguing who should make up the room.
I went to reception and waited about 5 minutes for a receptionist to appear.  She came out of a back office and wasn’t as professional as one would expect she appeared to have just eaten.
I told her about the room,  and the staff arguing, she apologised and decided we should change rooms., at the same time my daughter booked into the next room told reception she had no water at all .  The receptionist apologised and said we should both move rooms, from 1st to 2nd floor.  She gave us new rooms and we had the inconvenience of moving our belongings a floor up, with no offer of help.  We arrived in the new rooms and the sofa bed was not made up!  in addition my daughter needed a cot, someone had to bring a cot and was just dumped in the room.

We had a snack in the restaurant during the evening but had to leave as soon as we had finished because it was so cold we were most uncomfortable, other customers had their coats on.  I understand the need for ventilation, but this was an arctic blast blowing.

The next morning, the breakfast buffet was set up and we went for bags to put the food in,  receptionist told us none left sorry.  I asked what were we supposed to put the food in? she said plenty of seats take a tray  and sit down.  I explained we needed to get to the airport early because of the situation, which is why we need bags.  She said again take a tray and sit down.  She just didn’t understand the situation.  That was that we had no breakfast.

I would not recommend this hotel, we paid £400 for 2 rooms with shocking service and no breakfast, the hotel appears to be running on a shoe string and charging extortionate prices.

For future early flights we shall use a taxi return from Newton Abbot."
235,SazzyP79,2022-05-31,2.0,"Noisy and disorganised Positives - staff we met were lovely, location is excellent, very short walk to departures. 

Unfortunately lots of negatives - 

I had emailed the hotel on booking to request rooms next to each other due to us having fairly young children. I received an email back to confirm that the rooms had been pre allocated close together. On arrival, the receptionist clearly had no idea of this agreement, it wasn’t on my booking notes and the rooms that we were given (all that was left) were at opposite ends of the corridor.

The restaurant was very busy and we had to queue for at least 15 minutes each time we wanted a drink and to order food. We waited over an hour for our food which was very average.

The hotel was incredibly noisy and we hardly slept. I appreciate that this is an airport hotel and guests have flights throughout the night to get up for but the walls seemed to be paper thin and we could hear every movement. We also received 3 ‘knock and run’ visits from teenagers running up and down the corridors. 

I had also emailed prior to my visit to ask about parking. I was told to consult the airport website. The airport website did not show the hotel car park as available so I ended up booking a car park further away on the airport site. When we arrived, we realised that it is possible to turn up and pay at the hotel car park which would have been a much better option for us. I’m not sure why this information couldn’t have been shared when I emailed to ask."
236,eddieedwards29,2022-05-31,3.0,Convenient and clean  Lovely clean and spacious rooms. Was disappointed in the food quality and options considering there was much around ten airport site and couldn't just pop out. Breakfast was so much better though which I enjoyed. The room was great but had to ring downstairs to ask for another pillow as only 1 soft pillow was provided for each of us. A little surprised at the car parking fee considering the room price as was only there for less then 24 hours.
237,Silk44w,2022-05-31,5.0,By far and away my best stay of my trip! The staff were always willing to answer questions you had. The breakfast and dinner were lovely. A marked improvement on the last time I stayed! Slept very well overnight in a bed I hadn’t tried before which is unusual for me!
238,Iankb66,2022-06-30,3.0,"Ridiculous car park Here’s the problem with this hotel; parking! I din’t imagine anyone comes here by foot, and even anyone flying in would probably hire a car, so when we arrived and there wasn’t a parking space I was surprised. Moreover, the car park is designed so you can only drive through and out again. Having found that there wasn’t a parking space, it demanded £5 to allow us to look again. I went to Reception to remedy this, and predictably on my return there was an angry motorist behind me. Which meant - Ah! - a parking space. But this oversight, and the demand for a fiver merely for looking for a space, are unforgivable. 

Aside from that the hotel is clean and spacious, and the staff were courteous. But typically for an hotel of this class, the shower was a triumph of style over function. The low wall of the shower tray is way too low to accommodate the water it’s supposed to contain, so necessarily a shower of normal length floods the bathroom. 

It’s convenient for an early flight, and for that I’d stay here again."
239,delighted05,2022-05-31,5.0,A great place the night before traveling This is an excellent place to stay the night before your travel.  Breakfast is served at 4.00 am for a continental one and a full cooked English breakfast from 6.00 am. these are both buffet style and you can eat as much as suits you. Then its a very short walk up the ramp to the departures entrance.

Whilst I expected it to be “airport hotel” standard with a bit of wear of tear, I didn’t expect it to be so unclean. The bathroom was dirty with baked on tile dirt. The shower tray flooded, the bedside draw was broken, the glassware were dirty, the picture above the bed had a large amount of dust. The room didn’t really look like the hotels professional photos and reminded me of something from a flat pack furniture store.   This is not what I expected from the Hilton brand. On departure at 4am the receptionist just waved and said nothing else. It’s a shame I have another booking for August, I’d never have booked here again if I’d known how below standard it is for an expensive price. Let’s hope by August the rooms are cleaner!"

Two tiny pillows, one of which had a stain on the pillowcase, no fridge, cracked mug, one tiny hook in the bathroom to hang 2 bath and 2 hand towels.  Impossible.  It was like they were getting away with the minimum and blow any feeling of luxury.  With the nightmare of Bristol airport first thing the next morning, it would have been nice to feel treated well before.  Staff, however, excellent."
247,ExeterChris,2022-05-31,3.0,"Does the job We stayed for 1 night prior to an early flight.
Checking in and out was OK. You have to queue at the bar for drinks and food which was a little painful. The food we ate was OK but no better.
Our room was well equipped with a nice bathroom. The bed was a little small and tucked into the corner of the room which made getting into one side tricky.
All areas of the hotel were very clean.
I'd stay again for an early flight but not if I was visiting Bristol generally"
248,Trek08240083404,2022-05-31,1.0,Avoid online check in Awful check in process - avoid checking online through their app to get a digital key.

249,3anita,2022-04-30,3.0,Could be better We were pleased with the reception area and food on offer but on entering the room felt disappointed. The room had been arranged so one side of the bed was very close to the wall although the room was of a reasonable size. This made it difficult for my husband to get in and out of bed easily. There were only two pillows which is unusual on a king size bed and no decaf coffee or tea. The reason for only three stars is the early morning call at 3.30a.m did not happen! The receptionist had specifically asked if we wanted a call. Fortunately I had set my phone to wake us up or we would have missed our flight.
250,L5915CEjulieb,2022-04-30,3.0,"It was ok for one night We booked in order to be at the airport the night before our morning flight - just in case there were traffic delays on the day.
The room and public areas were clean and the amenities were satisfactory.
Breakfast was dire.  Everything from fruit to cutlery had run out and was not being replenished.  Customers were having to ask for cutlery and then it would appear and it was not busy.  I'm guessing we arrived after the early morning busy period but, even so, I would have thought that during the lull in which we and a few other guests arrived in we would have witnessed a hive of activity in replenishing the basics.  This didn't happen.
The reception desk was devoid of staff when we went to validate our parking ticket.  A member of staff went in search but was unsuccessful.  
It just wasn't the sort of experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel.
Next time, I think we'll try staying somewhere about 15 minutes down the road."
251,ejp1968,2022-04-30,1.0,"No early check-ins available at Hilton Hotels I have stayed in a few Hilton Hotels recently and they appear to have developed a strict early check in possibility. Pre-Covid, if you arrived an early and a room was available you would be able to check in. In big city and airport hotels this was never an issue. Hotels are not booked to full capacity currently and there was always one room available. Today I arrived at the Hampton by Hilton Hotel Bristol Airport at 10am due to a flight connection. The hotel is absolutely dead- you can see by the passenger traffic in the lobby. I was told by the receptionist that despite being a Gold member and despite having called ahead before making the reservation where I was told early check in would be determined on the day, that Hilton do not allow any check ins before 12 pm, even if they have rooms available. This is not the policy of many other chain hotels and I would encourage you to stay elsewhere if you need an early check in. 
I am checking out at 4am and so tomorrow, I hope someone is more fortunate than I am."
252,Dave_T999,2022-03-31,5.0,Great overnight stay. We stayed here for one night as our flight back from the Canaries was really late and we didn't want to drive home too tired. We had fairly low expectations to be honest as some people we met at the airport stayed here and said it was terrible. We were pleasantly surprised though. Check in was quick and easy. The room was great and we had a really nice breakfast the following morning. Could not fault it. We will definitely stay here again.
253,simonpZ4140MY,2022-04-30,5.0,"Fantastic Customer Service After being let down by EasyJet we had to rearrange our flights. 
Ebony on the hotel reception has been most helpful providing support to us with IT and arranging cups of tea.
All staff were wearing facemasks which was a delight to see given the rates of COVID in the area.
Would strongly recommend staying at the Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport."
254,WasherBottle,2022-03-31,1.0,Never again! Food offering in the evening and breakfast extremely limited and poor. I walked over to M & S in the Airport for a salad for my dinner as there was nothing remotely tempting on the menu. Dreadful nights sleep due to the bed being as hard as a board as were the pillows. This is a budget hotel of poor standard that is vastly over priced.
255,meinirann,2022-03-31,5.0,"Takes the stress out of solo travel The hotel is in the perfect location. Right by the airport and the bus station. An airport bus took me up there from Temple Meads station. I stayed as I had an early flight at 7.15am, and I was too nervous to drive, so I took the train, but of course there were no trains at that time of the morning, so I decided to stay the night. The hotel is a comfortable, peaceful city style hotel. It has all the amenities needed for a quick overnight stop. There’s a bar and a restaurant. There isn’t a great choice on the menu, but it does the job - something to keep you going until you reach your holiday destination. I had a burger with chips, and it certainly filled me up. The only negative really was the wake up call. I requested a 4.30am wake up call, but received a 3.30am wake up call. I couldn’t get back to sleep then, not that there would have been much point as I would have had less than an hour before I needed to get up, so I just decided to have a cuppa using the facilities in the room, and headed over to the airport a little earlier than planned. I will stay here again next time I fly from Bristol airport early."

Slight communication issue on arrival, but this was quickly resolved. 
Clean room on first floor. Very comfortable bed and good power shower. 
We used the gym - open 24/7 which is ideal. Was empty, apart from us. (See photos of equipment. The same as all other Hampton hotels.)
Evening meal choice was limited, but we did find something to suit us both. 
Excellent self-service breakfast included in the price which is a bonus.

Very quiet, despite being so close to the airport.   Food was tasty and hot. Breakfast plentiful and convenient.  Parking was a bit expensive and the rates need to be a lot clearer on the website - it's all a bit confusing.  What we ended up paying was similar to using one of the airport car parks though.  We found Ebony, who checked us in. to be really helpful, patient and friendly.  She took time to help us with procedures to get to the terminal, etc. and this was greatly appreciated. Thanks to her.
Overall, would definitely use again."
261,whohasthis,2022-02-28,3.0,"Purposely misleading parking signage - You can park in the paid parking area. Read the small print You can use the parking outside the hotel for guest unloading. Do not get fined like me.

Unfortunately the hotel is let down by the parking which is not managed by them but significantly impacted my stay.  There is a parking area outside the hotel however the display indicates that you have to pay about £5 for 0-2 hours (extortionate for a 5 min drop off) or something like that.  My father dropped me off just outside the parking barrier which took less than a minute but there is no stoping on all roads near the hotel so was fined.  
There is apparently 5min stoping allowed to drop off hotel guests in the parking area however this is not clearly displayed and I find it deceitful that it is not clearly displayed.  I think this happens to guests regularly as the staff were not surprised by what happened and informed me that the airport manages the parking.  Apparently in the second paragraph it says you can drop off guests (not on the fee information)  and they had requested that the signage be clearer but the airport had not done this.  I think it is a purposeful set up to fine as many people as possible to create revenue.  The car with the camera was there in seconds so I guess they wait nearby for people to make the same mistake over and over again at £60 a go!

If the signage would have been clear we would have used the parking and could have said good bye properly. This would have been much more preferable!

However the hotel was nice, basic but clean and I would stay again. The parking situation however has left a bad feeling so will be avoiding Bristol airport when possible!  Unfortunately the parking situation that is not in their control negatively affects my opinion."

Our meal was a worse experience than sitting in a motorway service area. 

The food was ultra bland but eclipsed by the SkySports football commentary being played to the entire restaurant by the occupants of a nearby table who cried out with the crudest of four letter language at every refereeing decision or offside. 

It was mentioned to staff but nothing was done about it. 

We will try somewhere else for our airport stay next time."
264,Sammythesmiler,2022-02-28,5.0,"Nice to see they have taken feedback onboard We stayed in this hotel in November 2021 and found it disappointing in some ways. We contacted the hotel who were quick to find out the issues and rectify them.

We came back again in February 2022 and had a better stay. The room was comfortable, the second bed was made up and they were quick to deal with any requests we had. The only issue we had was we had a room was near the bus station so it was quite noisy but I think that is just luck for which room you get.

the food is quite expensive here but it is nice and hot. We had pizzas and it is good to see they changed their supplier back to the old one. It was also an added bonus that you can get cooked breakfast from 6am now too.

The staff were friendly and they will do anything to help you. I would definitely visit again."
265,julians696,2022-02-28,4.0,"Nice hotel. Shame about the check out. This is a standard 'Hampton by Hilton' so anyone familiar with the brand, will know exactly what to expect.

Check in went smoothly, dinner was OK, my bed was very comfortable and breakfast was standard  Hampton.

The only disappointment was on checkout. The woman behind the desk (morning shift 24/02) appeared to regard customers as a HUGE inconvenience. I asked her to call me a taxi and she behaved as if this was an unreasonable request and when I asked for a paper copy of the bill, she reacted as if I had asked for something so out of the ordinary, she could barely believe it.

If I ran this hotel, I would probably find her a different job, where she would feel less inconvenienced by the customers whose money pays here wages."
266,I7972QWdavidw,2022-02-28,5.0,"Great start to the holiday We chose to stay over at the airport prior to our holiday.  We had a lengthy flight ahead (six hours) and a significant commute (four hours) from home.  Accordingly, to minimise stress and give the holiday a good start, we chose to sleep at the airport on the night before departure.  We chose this hotel because it allowed parking for the duration of the holiday, at an extra cost, actually on the aiport estate.  We could then walk to the terminal.  Mobility impaired dedicated parking is available and the hotel has step free access.  Our room was located upstairs (via lift) along a carpeted corridor.  Our window looked out onto the multi-storey car park.  The cost of our stay included breakfast, with a 'continental' option available from 0400 and the 'Full English' from 0600.  Our flight departure time enabled us to partake of the full English option and it didn't disappoint.  We found that a nice touch was the availability of ""to go"" coffee cups and the opportunity to ""take away"" croissants and pastries.  We took the pastries onto the aircraft saving the exorbitant, sky high even, cost of in-flight food.  Access from the hotel to the terminal is from the ground floor, via a covered walkway which is auto-illuminated, leading to steps/ramp to a Zebra-crossing and then further steps/ramp to a further Zebra-crossing leading to the arrivals door.  Our only negative was a slow draining shower tray - ""Mr Muscle"" could probably assist - but this isn't enough to downgrade the overall rating.  All staff were very helpful and mindful of covid restrictions.  Signage from the main A38 was excellent and we arrived into the hotel car park without mishap.  The barrier gave us a ticket, which when inserted on departure worked perfectly.  We were very happy with our stay.  We had a comfortable, quiet night.  Just a five minute walk to the terminal and a good start to our sunshine break.

Trays for your breakfast which you stack up when finished, food is poor and selection is limited. Poached eggs aren’t even an option at breakfast. They apparently would take too long for them to cook.
The coffee machine; I selected hot water and brown gunk came out. 
If you have to leave early the continental breakfast is poor or not available as there’s no kitchen staff working until later on. 
The Evening food selection is no better. 
The beds are super uncomfortable as are the pillows. Both very hard.  What you would think was like sleeping on a mortuary slab. 
They offer no real solutions other than putting another quilt under the sheets. So obviously a fairly common complaint."

The rooms are modern and well equipped. The evening meal was very disappointing. Chose a special of Lamb shank which was accompanied by frozen vegetables which were just barely defrosted. The atmosphere is more akin to a waiting room with regular blasts of cold air from the automatic opening doors.
On the other hand the breakfast buffet was generous and full of variety. Self service was a little tricky with the reccomendation  to use the trays,  but nowhere to place them while collecting the items."

I'm not a big eater prior to flying so had the soup which was delicious and piping hot, the cost of meals were very reasonable as were the drinks.

The rooms are all the same, ""cookie cutter"" rooms - bland, clean, sterile, functional. The rooms are always fine, though sometimes, hot, sometimes rather cool.... If the air-con is off, it does take some time for it to switch modes, so don't go mad waiting for the transition. 

Breakfast is basic: juices (blended if its orange and its very average); the usual cereals, tea, coffee, etc. and included in the price.  Not a lot of atmosphere, but it does fulfill its purpose. I will keep using it."

Living just an hour from this relatively new hotel, with the prospect of an early start for a flight to the sunny Canary Islands, we thought it looked like a good idea.  The hotel is convenient to the airport and parking was easy.  Reception was pleasant and the room was nice.  All looked good until we wanted to have a relaxing meal.  Oh my god what a mistake it proved to stay here.  The list of options, you could not call it a menu, was made up of the most basic items that could be heated in a microwave or thrown in a fryer. My burger was acceptable but with almost no vegie items for my wife she chose a jacket potato and what sounded a bit like isso misso, a seafood selection.  The jacket potato was uncooked and hard and the seafood selection turned out to be 6 calamari rings with half a plate of chopped salad with brown sauce liberally sprayed all over it. These dishes were sent back and my wife with no other edibal options went to bed without any food. The staff admitted they should have a better offering but the management will not give approval."
284,PugslejanetdV5516NN,2021-11-30,5.0,"One night pre flight stay Very impressed with this hotel.  Check in simple and reception staff exceptionally friendly.  I was travelling on my own, so I asked if there was room service and although there wasn't, you could order at the bar and ask for it to be put on a tray to take up to your room, however I decided to try the bar and didn't feel uncomfortable at all sitting there on my own. 
You ordered at the bar and they brought it to your table.  Menu was quite small but what I had was very enjoyable, freshly cooked and hot. All payments were taken by card (no cash) at the time of ordering.
Room comfortable with the usual tea/coffee etc, hairdryer.  Wake up call booked and received. 
Walk to the airport the next morning was quick, no more than 5 minutes and you could take a ramp or steps so suitable for everyone.
I would definitely stay again if I were to fly out of Bristol Airport."
285,VoyageVogage123,2021-11-30,5.0,"Felt like 4 star Stayed here to avoid an early flight over for my daughter’s Hen do starting the next day. Room with sofa bed & footstool was super clean (well done to the Housekeeping team) and very comfortable, with plenty of space and even a desk with office type chair.
The bar/restaurant area is well set out. Enjoyed a drink with friends in the evening, with a good atmosphere. Breakfast the next morning was something to look forward to - usual hot selection (eggs, bacon, sausages etc) as well as cereals, fruit (grapefruit very good), selection of breads & pastries and even a waffle machine. There was a press button coffee machine & selection of fruit teas too.
Hotel is right at the airport, you just follow the signs, cross the road and walk directly to it under a covered walkway. It is geared up for guests getting flights, with useful monitors in the seating areas displaying live flight arrivals & departures.
Check out is 11, but no problem hanging around in the seating areas to wait for flights/people arriving.
Covid safety measures have all been thought through and implemented and I found the staff to be friendly and efficient. The reception guy kindly rejigged my booking so that I could check in earlier, as soon as I arrived, and changed my room from a twin to a double, which I appreciated. I’m sorry I didn’t get his name, but I checked in at around 2.30pm. He provided excellent customer service, and deserves a mention.
All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It’s around £100 per night for 2 people (depending on when you book) including breakfast, so not budget end, but it gave me a relaxing start to the Hen weekend."
286,olwenwilliams99,2021-11-30,5.0,Perfect for early morning flight We were flying early the next morning so decided to book an overnight stay. We were a bit concerned as a lot of negative reviews. However we couldn’t fault our stay. Hotel and rooms were clean.. our bed was comfortable.. staff were helpful and friendly. We didn’t eat at the hotel but had a drink and that was fine. We were even able to have a buffet breakfast at 5am before leaving. We’ll definitely stay again if flying early.
287,JV1966Dub,2021-11-30,3.0,"Please improve  your food offering A great hotel in many respects. Good clean rooms and on the door step of Bristol Airport. I've stayed here a few times now and it's big failing is it's food and drink offer. A limited, very average menu, more akin to a Mway Service Station, canteen style. But not cheap. As an example, the food is delivered to your table and you then have to go and collect your cutlery. Only if you ask is it revealed where it can be found. A small shift in gear could really elevate the experience for travellers and justify it's room rate."
288,OceanLife99,2021-10-31,4.0,"Good Stay My first time to stay here and I was very impressed with their covid precautions.

The reception & bar staff were friendly & chatty & remembered me from previous stays which was unexpected but lovely.  The food menu is limited but what you get is cheap & cheerful & most importantly delicious, really recommend the veggie burger & the veggie risotto which was a special one of the nights I was there! I’ll definitely stay again when I’m next working in Bristol!"
290,FDswansea,2021-10-31,3.0,"Decent rooms but limited menu and bar more like a canteen Rooms in the hotel are good but you get the almost the same from Premier Inns at half the price. The bar restaurant is like a canteen, cold and indifferent more like a small group meeting place. Menu is also far inferior to that on offer in airport Premier Inns that we have stayed at."

292,Sungirltravel,2021-10-31,1.0,"Terrible Stayed at this hotel booked through work.On arrival at reception I asked for a top floor quiet room which I requested through an email.They said the hotel was full and placed me on floor 1.The rooms are small and very basic.Up to 2300 I had small children running up and down the corridor screaming.Doors slamming from 6am and hardly any sleep.The breakfast was luke warm and burnt sausages every morning.The reception staff are very unhelpful and would not move me to a quiet room as they said it would cost them to reclean my room.They are more concerned about cost than the guest having a good nights sleep.Went out the next day to return and my room had not been cleaned and no fresh towels.
Will not return to this hotel and to the reception staff please be a bit more friendly and courteous to your guests."

294,LaidBacknHappy,2021-10-31,4.0,"Tremendous, convenient travellers hotel serving truly dreadful food. This is a very well appointed travellers hotel convenient for the long stay car park and the main terminal.  The rooms and public spaces are exceptionally clean and the rooms well appointed with nice bedding and super bathrooms.  The staff are excellent; friendly, helpful and remarkably cheerful.  The rooms represent good value for money.  The only real downside is the truly awful food; were it not for the food offering (<1*) this would be a 5* review.  As it stands, you’ve driven hours to get to your departure airport to overnight before a red-eye flight and you are faced with mass-produced, industrial fayre - burgers, deep fried ‘salt & pepper’ (?) squid rings and cardboard frozen pizzas - that are full of bad calories and are of little nutritional value.  Truly awful and at £12 for a cheese and tomato pizza (despite ‘authentic Italian’ claims, I cannot bring myself to call it a Margarita).  This really needs sorting out."
295,Lindzyg75,2021-10-31,3.0,Ok for a quick night stay before flight We stayed here the night before we flew to Mallorca.

The food is shocking, we ordered the special curry & a pizza - the pizza was burnt & the curry was cold and tasted awful, the rooms are clean enough but are extremely cold I think the heating system is turned off at night ? It’s just ok here, a one night stay is all it’s good for …"
297,juliec289,2021-10-31,2.0,"Very average hotel This felt more like a budget hotel trying to be something different. It was very understaffed,  but I do appreciate the difficulties a lot of places are having in finding staff. The evening menu was very small and the food was average. Distinct lack of information both at check in and in the room. Parking also very confusing. We were told to ignore the signs at the entrance to the car park as they were incorrect - why not change the sign? The location was very good and the room was spotlessly clean, but we would not stay there again."
298,Relax393555,2021-10-31,1.0,"Mrs F Terrible dont stay here. Food is awful wine is even worse the only good thing is the location. Service is poor no staff. If you're old and don't have a smart phone, which we are not, but there were, you have to download the qr reader view the menu, which is dire, then line up and order. DONT ORDER A STARTER! THEY WILL FORGET YOUR MAIN AND THEN WHEN REMINDED ONE HOUR LATER ZAP IT IN A MICROWAVE!!!!! 

Shocking, bring your own!"
299,chriscraine06,2021-10-31,2.0,Average hotel Location right next to the airport is convenient albeit not many amenities close by. Food in the restaurant was very poor and would not recommend. Mattress and pillows were uncomfortable. Average hotel in good location. Overpriced in my opinion.
300,247gabrielles,2021-09-30,5.0,"Excellent stay with great customer service The staff was very helpful at this hotel! We were able to put our food in the refrigerator in the luggage room and they heated up food for us in the kitchen microwave. The room was a nice size even with our baby in her travel tent. There is not a guest laundry. They validate your parking so that it is cheaper when you check out. If you leave an come back within the day, just let them know so that you’re not charged multiple times. 
The breakfast our first morning was the best we’ve had at a Hilton in the UK. Everything was nicely laid out. They had waffles that were delicious with great toppings. The coffee maker worked well and even had hot chocolate. There was also fresh orange juice!"
301,SallyA351,2021-09-30,5.0,Book direct to the Hotel not through another booking company that charged £40 more! The hotel was perfect for a very short stay after a very early landing.

302,352andrewm,2021-09-30,4.0,Good hotel for a one night stay Stayed a few times at this budget hotel located within a short walk from the terminal. Have always experienced a clean quiet room and a good breakfast. Probably not great value price wise but convenient for a one-night stay if you fly in late or fly out early.
303,hart662017,2021-09-30,5.0,"Consistently good and friendly service Clean,  modern hotel, with all facilities required for an overnight stay plus a well-equipped gym. Excellent breakfast with takeaway option. Reception was both efficient and friendly as always. Very convenient for Terminal"
304,richardcjarman,2021-09-30,5.0,"Excellent airport hotel. The Hampton is a very short walk from the main terminal and is step free, it should take no longer than a couple of minutes. You can reach the city centre and Temple Meads Station by the A1 airport bus which runs very frequently and on which senior citizen passes are accepted.

The hotel is bright and modern and is pristene. Covis measures are taken very seriously and the whole hotel is beautifully clean. The rooms are all standard quite spacious and very comfortable with a large bathroom with a large walk in shower. It is very quiet.

Breakfast is incuded in the room rate and a cold breakfast is served from 4am and the full breakfast fom 7am. The dinner menu is very limited, sandwiches, burgers and pizzas. The special was greek salad with tofu.......not something I would call ""special"". I chose the burger and it was actually very good with lots of cheese and bacon. The potato wedges were very tasty."
305,justhadtosay,2021-08-31,4.0,"Good hotel and location Often use this hotel but there is no other choice at Bristol if you want to be near the terminal. 
The hotel is fine. Not a luxury hotel but rooms are very comfortable especially for one night and very clean. 
Food is quite good for the standard of hotel. I often have the Greek salad which is excellent. 
Service is good and staff are masked and have some screens. 

Signs are up telling guests to wear masks and some clearly can’t read. I realise this is hard to enforce and idiots are everywhere but it did make us feel quite uncomfortable especially as we were going on holiday and the last thing we needed was a positive test result. 
Will use again mainly due to location which is great if your flight is very early."
306,JackieC559,2021-09-30,4.0,"Overnight stay Good location. As this is the only hotel at the airport there is no competition. Do not think it is worth what the hotel is changing. Rooms are kept very clean. Good selection at breakfast but was lacking cutlery, a lot of baskets were empty."
307,553geraldw,2021-08-31,3.0,"Disappointed - Not up to Hilton standards. As many reviews have stated, this hotel (although it is very convenient for access to Bristol Airport) does not reach the standards expected from a Hilton Hotel. However the prices do. The food, both in the evening and for the early breakfast, was poor. Eating in the evening, we were surrounded by people at adjoining tables who were complaining about the poor quality and high prices. Parking for more than one night costs double that of the multi-storey car park which is 20 metres away.
This place is designed and run by accountants, not hoteliers."
308,DavidRawl,2021-08-31,2.0,"Beware drop off process + 1 pillow per person and staff not wearing masks Beware drop off - If being dropped off beware there is a process to follow or you'll get a big fine (as noted in other reviews). There is no 'drop off zone' for the hotel so you need to enter the hotel car park and get a ticket. Then when checking in they will validate the ticket for a free period. You then give that back to your taxi/drop off and they can leave. They need to put this info on the Parking/Directions page as its not clear either before or on arrival - as noted by many others. 

1 pillow per person is so bad, it's funny. Cost, covid? No idea why - but the least ANY hotel of any class should do is provide 2 pillows per person. You can ask for more, and they were delivered quickly but whether to save laundry during covid or cost - whatever the reason they really should have 2 pillows in rooms. Its not a hostel. 

FOOD - Food was better than others have indicated. Menu was limited and I think if you go in thinking ""pub food from the 90's"" (not a bad thing) then you'll enjoy a decent meal. I can understand why others would expect more from an Airport hotel from a major brand, but it was just OK enough. 

ROOMS - rooms were fine (except the pillows) and a 3-5 min easy (uphill/steps) walk to the Airport was nice for a 6am flight. 

STAFF - I found staff helpful and friendly, especially our check in lady who doubled as our bar server and waitress too! However, there was one team member (I think the same one as referred to in many other reviews) who seemed  'abrasive' and lacking friendliness and a smile. I have to stay this team member also seemed very efficient and knowledgeable and I think their desire for efficiency and speed sometimes came across as unfriendly and unhelpful. Training would fix that. 

COVID UNSAFE - All front of house staff wore masks but no housekeeping staff had any masks on at all. I came across at least 4 housekeeping staff and none were wearing masks despite operating in tight hallways and the ones I saw made no effort to get out of the way forcing you to squeeze past them in close proximity with them wearing no masks. 

Worst some housekeepers seemed to be coughing and sneezing whilst inside cleaning rooms and in the air starved corridors - so whatever left their mouth or nose is now in your room, on your bedding, on surfaces. I also witnessed COVID cleaning protocols totally ignored and clear cross contamination between rooms (cleaning multiple rooms at same time, mixing items, etc). Terrible practice for the current times. 

The hotel was ""just OK"" (except the covid unsafe stuff) and the poor rating really reflects the fact that many of the issues raised in previous reviews (info on drop off on website, food range/quality, attitude of some staff, have clearly just been ignored over a long period. Just read the reviews - all these issues have been mentioned multiple times. 

I hope this review helps the management focus in on areas of concern and fix them - as they can all be easily fixed with the right management."
309,Tariq127,2021-08-31,4.0,"Good convenient Stay & Perfect has a base when traveling around the local area Had a very good 4 day stay here this is my 2nd time at the hotel thankfully i had a better quality stay this time and wasn't overcharged. 

I like how this hotel have shower rooms in all rooms and beds are comfortable. They are on the little small side but they are perfect for a few days stay. 

The main thing that is letting this hotel down is the quality of the food menu for a Hilton branded hotel it is very poor and the cheapest of cheap food is ordered from the suppliers i know Hampton by Hilton is meant to be budget friendly to compete with the likes of Travelodge and premier inn but most of the time premium prices are paid for the rooms here. For example this time  i paid £213 per night for the room. 

I definitely feel this hotel would be better has a Hilton Garden Inn especially when the Holiday Inn around a Mile or two down the road offers a very good menu. 

I have stopped in both Travelodge and premier inn airport hotel's and both have better quality food and menu's available."

No smiles, no pleasantries, nothing.. I am amazed people choose hospitality as a profession that they clearly aren't enjoying.. Then the room.. Squeezing in a queen size bed doesn't make the room queen size.. I noticed the tea tray.. cheap condiments with no bottled water or buscuits.. the TV had very limited channels as most were unavailable due to signal issues.. thankfully the bed was OK.. In the morning it was a buffet breakfast (cereal, yoghurt, etc)  the sort you find in a cheap budget hotel.. Tasteless sausages and only scrambled eggs as an option.. Where's the smoked salmon???.. On arriving home I realised I have left my charger in the room..  no email or courtesy call from hotel to say this has been found..

No USB charge points in room. Soap in dispensers in bathroom had gone hard so came out as thick clumpy gel versus liquid. Room not serviced so no fresh towels for the 3 nights. Breakfast was poor. We have stayed at other Hamptons and breakfast was always good both in quality and options. Here every day there was some or other item not available. Had to always ask someone to restock the item. Seemed they were low staffed. Also hot breakfast was usually cold or luke warm. Scrambled eggs looked like yellow sand. Have to pay for parking even if a hotel guest. In general an ok hotel but lacks any character and not the usual standard expected of a Hilton.

We parked in the airport multistory car park so had a covered walkway to the hotel. Check in was quick and easy.  Our room on the ground floor was ready and the door sealed with a sticker showing it was sealed after cleaning.  The room was clean and comfortable and the shower unit was excellent. The range of food options available for an evening meal were  very poor and we choose not to eat.  They supply a take out buffet breakfast from 4AM but we did not use this service.

However, the quality of food for an evening meal is shocking, genuinely the worst I have ever experienced.  My 'beef' burger was grey or green - I really couldn't tell - but certainly a colour I have never seen before on anything edible.  The wedges soggy.  My wife's meal had coleslaw that had a crust which you broke through - think Ice Magic if you are old enough to remember.  So, definitely stay there for position and incredible convenience but eat before you get there."

The hotel was spotlessly clean; very good rooms; excellent public room facilities and absolutely fabulous service.

327,Tillard,2021-06-30,5.0,"Usual Hilton high standard Unlike most guests we were not flying into/out of the airport but chose this hotel for an overnight stay en route to our home in the South West.

We have always been impressed by Hilton hotels and this one didn't disappoint at all and lived up to our expectations.

Our room was comfortable, spotlessly clean and well-equipped with everything you would need from tea/coffee facilities to a safe, hairdryer and ironing board. Despite the close proximity to the airport and a surprising number of flight arrivals and departures we heard no aircraft noise at all.

We found the staff to be friendly and very efficient and they gace the impression that they seriously cared about looking after their guests.

Breakfast was excellent given the restrictions placed on the hotel by the Covid regulations. The menu for the evening meal was limited and service was a little slow but the food was excellent when it arrived.

Car parking for our overnight stay was £8. 

Overall, this is an excellent hotel and we would certainly stay here again if using the airport."

331,L7768EQdavidd,2020-11-30,4.0,"All very good except a bit cold Tuesday 3rd November and we booked to spent the night here due to its proximity to Bristol Airport, we had a 6.00 am check in the following morning. 

We checked in, got our key and made our way to our room. It was reassuring to see a paper seal on the door, which stated that the room had been deeply cleaned, we had to break the seal to enter. 

Our twin bedroom was bright, modern, very clean and well maintained. It was equipped with an iron, ironing board, television, hair dryer, tea and coffee making facilities were also provided. 

There was an air conditioning / heater unit in the room, we could not get the heater bit to work, the room was a bit chilly. 

As there were no bars or restaurants about we were limited to the facilities at the hotel. 

The bar, dining area and reception were all located in the vast modern open plan area on the ground floor. 

Two people working, reception, the bar and taking food and drink orders as well as serving them.  Caroline and  Becky worked hard to ensure that all guests were well looked after, all done in a cheerful manner. 

In accordance with COVID 19 safety measures we sat at a table, indicating we were ready to order drinks and food. Everything was delivered to the table, all table service. 

A pint of larger and ale was £8.30, reasonably priced and a lot less than we expected to pay 

There was a small food menu consisting of burgers, pizza, or a broccoli bake, we were informed by our waitress that there were 2 curry dishes of the day. 

We ordered chicken tikka masala and a red lentil Dahl which were served with rice and 2 small naan breads £11.95 each. It was rather tasty. 

As we were leaving, in the morning, before breakfast started, food bags were available for collection as we left. This consisted of a croissant, pain au chocolat, a banana and a juice. 

Overall we were very satisfied with all aspects of our stay, except that everywhere in the hotel was a bit cold, too cold for the time of year. 

Good food, reasonably priced drinks, really great staff, comfortable clean room, a good night's sleep and competitive room rates."

He later received a fine notice from VCS for £100 for stopping less than one minute as we got our cases out of his car. He was not causing any obstruction, he did not get out off the car, he was off the main road,  there was no one else around and he had a blue badge! He appealed to VCS but it was dismissed. We had not been warned in advance by the hotel about stopping or the alternative parking arrangements to use the hotel car park and claim back the charge There was nothing on their website to indicates a drop off facility. When we contacted the hotel after receiving the fine the hotel staff were not sympathetic but agreed that it had not been made clear to us at the time of booking and there was nothing on their website about it. They said there was nothing they could do about the fine.
We had also ordered an early morning breakfast from the hotel. This was a fruit juice, coffee and croissants. When we tried to eat this before walking to the airport we were told we couldn't consume it in the hotel restaurant because of covid-19 restrictions, yet they were serving meals in the dining area the evening before! The alternative was to have it in our room which by this time we had vacated. We had not been warned about this in advance.  I asked the hotel staff where we could sit down to have our breakfast at the airport before going through security and they said they didn't know (and seemed to not care either). So we ended up having to have carry our breakfast along with our luggage to the airport. When I fed this back to the hotel afterwards I received no apology or any recognition of the problem. This hotel is certainly not customer friendly and we will not be staying here again. 
Overall Bristol Airport seems to want to stop people flying as it used to be possible to drop passengers off for free (10 mins max) but now it costs £4. At this rate it will soon be £100 or maybe they would prefer to stop people flying all together!"

Parking at the hotel, very clean and the staff were very helpful especially with the quick and easy check in process.

Very happy with the first experiences of this hotel and would definitely use upon next visit to Bristol airport"
334,katieb834,2020-10-31,4.0,"Airport We stayed here the day/night before our 6am flight from Bristol to Crete!! What a little gem, we were very impressed as the first time staying here as normally stay at premier inn if a early or late flight etc. The hotel was lovely,clean,room perfect, we went for a drink and ended up having some food off the menu as it looked great and was too, not expensive either!! The staff all helpful and friendly and we will book again and recommend!!! Great value hotel perfect for Bristol airport!!"
335,E610YNcarolc,2020-10-31,5.0,"Great stay Stayed one night as I had a very early flight the next morning. I used the Honors App to check in and access my room which meant no contact with staff.  My room had a seal on the door with information available about their upgraded cleaning programme. Absolutely spotless room, lots of hand sanitizing stations throughout high traffic areas.  The menu was better than I had expected after reading other reviews and the staff were very curteous and socially distanced appropriately at all times. Breakfast at 4am was takeaway bags with fruit juice and coffee available, perfectly adequate under the present circumstances.  Very pleasant experience and cheap at £63 for a queen room!"

I can’t praise this gentleman enough. 
He was friendly, knowledgeable and extremely professional. 
He ensured that all guests felt safe in the current environment and whilst remaining happy and friendly, he made sure we all abided by the current rules and regulations. 
He is an excellent ambassador to the Hilton hotel group. 
I will return. 

I should add that all the staff were fabulous."
337,patsuntan,2020-10-31,5.0,"Pre before and after flight stays So near airport a great place to stay! Greeted by welcoming reception staff who explained all about covid masks, brekfast etc. We had four stays here this year and everytime we have stayed the hotel has been spotless, all measures for covid are in place. The room was really comfortable, clean and spacious.Bathroom had all essentials and nice fluffy towels. Breakfast was changed a few times due to the situation, but there was plenty, lovely grab bags, tea, coffee,juice etc. We had one full english which was lovely on one of the stays. Well done to all staff working there as these times are so difficult for the hospitality sector. Will stay again when travel resumes!"
338,Tariq127,2020-08-31,2.0,"Poor food, overcharged by just under £400  Checkin was swift i checked in using the hilton honours app i went to reception to get keys which were swift and all members of staff was wearing masks. 

Room
The room was clean on arrival and i like how every room had a walk in low profile shower. I originally stopped here from the 24th August to the 26th august and the shower kept filling up i reported this on checkout. I checked back into the hotel on the 28th August and thought I would check into the same room and guess what the shower still kept filling up so my repair log basically went ignored which I found to be very poor.

Food
The food is very poor the dinner choices in the restaurant is extremely limited the burgers were dry and tasteless the best burger i had which isn't displayed on the menu is the quorn burger I found that was fairly meaty. For the overall quality of the food it is overpriced and a complete let down to have the hilton name attached to it, i am aware of hamptons business model of a limited food menu but that doesn't mean the food has to be low quality and generally food I would find in Iceland. Even the pizzas were poor they were very dry with not much cheese on and even that is frozen. 

Staff First of all I would like to give a shout out to the following staff members who provided provided good customer service and went above and beyond Stuart from night staff, Anna, jasmine from night staff who helped me resolve the overcharge issue and spent two hours with me to resolve it she should definitely be manager. Sadly the night staff were a lot better than the day staff I found a lot of the day staff to be lazy and i even had a situation where a member of the bar staff ""Tony"" refused to carry some drinks over to my table with being disabled and using a walking stick i can generally only manage to carry one drink at a time, i asked Tony if he could carry the drinks over to my table has i had 4 drinks and he said I can't do that but i can give you a tray, i clearly made it clear it was only to my table but when i made a complaint he lied and said he thought i meant taking the drinks to the room which I didn't mention at any time.

Overcharged 
After 7 days of stopping in the hotel has i used the hotel has a base for my stay caution when it was due to checkout at the end of my booked days my illnesses were flaring up so I kept extending my room on a daily basis. Well after a few days of being in the hotel i checked my bank account via cash point and figured that i had some money missing from my account. I checked with the hotel and they said everything that was charged on the bill was right but something still didn't add up. Well two days passed and I found some receipts and the remembered hotel kept wanting me to preauthorise some funds for the bar has after 10pm you can only charge to room which i was fine with at the time. But when i had my final invoice the hotel didn't take off the funds from my invoice that i preauthorised the bill was £1453 but yet the hotel pre authorised £1845 which is way too much meaning I couldn't spend that money and the hotel didn't release it back to my card. 

For anyone aware of most hotels the hotel shouldn't generally take no more than £50 to £100 pre auth then any charges take off the amount already preauthorised and any money left over after charges release back onto card and do that every 24 hours. Well this hotel didn't do any of that they took money charged from my account and kept almost £400. So if you are going to stop at this hotel keep a careful track of your balance and try and do everything pay as you go rather than charge to the room.

Parking is charged at £8per day which is reasonable for a airport hotel although most people do only stop for 1 night unless stopping there on business i think for stays of 3 or more nights they should have a cheaper rate where you can buy in advance of say £5 per day.

Overall it is a nice modern hotel has plenty of disabled parking spaces although having a disabled badge doesn't give you free parking i often stop at Travelodge in Gatwick when flying from there and disabled badge holders get free parking there and that's Travelodge which is a lower class of hotel so i think Hilton should offer it to their disabled guests. The hotel is generally open plan. With everything that has happened I don't think i will stop here again next time i will stopping in the Holiday inn which is located 2 miles down the road and offer a free shuttle to the airport."
339,MervFrome,2020-09-30,2.0,"Brand new hotel with basic furnishings and awful menu Expected the Hilton brand to live up to its reputation for quality, but sadly disappointed. The room was clean and new with basic furniture, the lounge area had no soul and was like a waiting room, and the menu was so limited that you could have found more variety at a roadside snack caravan. The hotel car park and surrounding entrance belongs to Bristol Airport and any unwary traveller stopping to read direction notices faces a fine of £100 - and staff assured me that many had been caught. The management explained that they were operating under Covid 19 restrictions but so were the other hotels in our trip, and they managed to provide a far more comfortable experience. On the upside the airport is right on the doorstep, but I certainly wont be using this place again. I also noted that the bill showed on my credit card as being paid on the day of arrival, but was still there eight days later as a pending charge. I had to phone twice to have the duplicate amount removed."

341,Thespy55,2020-09-30,5.0,Could not fault this hotel The hotel was simply immaculate and super clean. The receptionist was very welcoming and informative about the routines and procedures in place. The room was spotless and the bed was super comfortable. The service in the restaurant was excellent and the fishcake special was extremely tasty. The great breakfast was incredibly well organised.

343,AmyLJ,2020-09-30,5.0,"Best choice for Bristol Airport While it wasn't cheap to stay here with 5 nights parking in the multistorey (£190) , we felt it was worth it just for the convenience, having a 6am flight. 

The room was very clean and comfortable and the staff were amazing.  The covered walkway meant it was just a couple of minutes walk to departures.  Best of all was the continental breakfast which was available from 4am.  There was plenty of choice and if you were in a rush to get to departures, as we were, there were bags you could take already filled with fresh fruit and cereal bars and you could add whatever you wanted from the continental buffet plus the hot drinks were given in handy takeaway containers.  Highly recommended and won't hesitate to stay again."
344,dans1977uk,2020-09-30,5.0,"Very clean, safe and convenient Stayed the night before an early flight in early September 2020.  The hotel has adapted really well to social distancing, and while still offering a full bar and restaurant service, it feels safe.  The staff all wear face coverings and they are strongly encouraged for guests.  The breakfast starting at 4am was perfect as I had to leave by 5am, and everything was individually wrapped and / or sealed, primarily using paper too which is good for those of an environmentally concerned stance as most of us are these days.  Friendly staff, and the room itself was comfortable and clean.  No problems at all really, other than the whole 'sliding-door-for-the-wardrobe-and-the-bathroom-in-one' thing... it's just not right (IMHO) - put a proper door on the lav when you build the next hotel, Hampton!!!

Oh - gluten free options were safe too as my partner is coeliac and ate safely here :)"
345,BricklayerUk,2020-08-31,5.0,"Fabulous hotel We came to this hotel after being let down by the dreadful OYO WINFORD MANOR , who cancelled our reservation without reason.
We arrived at the Hampton By Hilton ( HBH ) and asked if they could accommodate us, fortunately they could. The reception area was very impressive, smart, spacious and welcoming. We were registered efficiently , and given our room, which was spacious , comfortable , beautiful beds, good power shower , TV , coffee and tea facilities, a sign on the door and a seal , saying that the room had been sterilised , and it really was spotless.
It was beautifully quiet , and a comfortable environment in which to stay . The cleanliness really impressed us , especially with the current situation with Covid. There was sanitiser in the room too.
In the reception , the bar was functional , and we enjoyed a couple of drinks, and then we booked a table for dinner, menus all done via QR code , really good, hygienic and functional.
The menu although limited, was excellent , I enjoyed a very nice burger and my other half enjoyed a pizza !
The hotel is a few minutes walk from the main terminal , so very handy. Normally , I would have booked the airport parking for an extra night, but as this was a last minute booking , we had to pay the HBH rather high overnight charge of £ 16.50.
Staff here were fabulous , very friendly , welcoming and very Covid aware.
Great choice if you are flying out of Bristol !"

I thank them."
349,itsBryne_Norway,2020-07-31,4.0,"A very good airport hotel. If you plan to stay at/close toBristol airport, this is the place to stay.

The hotel is in easy walking-distance from the terminal. I guess 200 meters. 

The hotel seems to be very new and very clean.

The rooms and bathrooms have a good size.  There is lots of available space for car-parking ‘next door’. 

The staff we met were nice and helpful.

They seem to be taking covid-19 very seriously. This had seriously affected their breakfast and made it simpel, but sufficient. If your flight is very early, breakfast is available from 0400.

I am glad we choose this hotel for the one night we had to stay close to the airport."

352,alsaldevon,2020-03-31,1.0,"A Bad Experience We will not be using the hotel again. We had an early morning flight so we arrived early evening. We planned to have a pre-dinner drink, a meal and retire early. The bar serves drinks and also takes the food orders. The drinks were overpriced and the food less than appetising, all served in a public seating area that had less ambience that a factory warehouse. The management might also get a grip with customer service. Our accommodation was a pre-booked Queen Room with a bed that proved extremely uncomfortable. On the basis of our evening experience we chose not to sample the breakfast offering. The only redeeming feature of our stay, was the early morning call that was on time."

Dislike having to have drinks booked to the room. Chose to have a coffee in our room instead. Hiltons loss."
355,BobsCardiff,2020-03-31,1.0,"Heartless Hilton My wife and I used this hotel last December, the night before a flight to Porto and it was excellent, as per my TA post back then. As aresult of that experience, we booked again for March, 2020, prior to our trip to Rome. Covid-19 resulted in easyJet cancelling our flights. We contacted the various providers for our trip and had the following responses:-
easyJet - full refund of all flight and associated payments
Private taxi firm for transfers in Rome - full refund less £10 cancellation fee.
Mercure Roma Centro Colloseum Hotel, Rome - they have offered to keep our reservation open and honour it for 9 months, despite it being a non refundable booking. Bless them- they didn't have to at all.
People and businesses in Rome are experiencing a devastating collapse in their tourist trade and yet they have the decency to try all they can to accomodate travellers. Good on them and great foresight as those travellers will return.
Now to the Hilton Hotel at Bristol and their response. Via Booking.Com, we requested not a refund but that we simply be allowed to change the booking so that we could reserve a room in July when we are due to travel to Krakow. The trip to Rome was for our 35th wedding anniversary and my wife has an autoimmune condition called Sarcoidosis which affects her lungs. Despite Booking.Com, in their words, 'reaching out' to Hilton, their response was a flat refusal to move the date of our booking. We are going through an unprecedented time in the world at the moment when what we need to see is compassion and selfless acts as displayed by the operators in Rome. What do we see from Hilton? Pure greed and total intransigence. Shame on you!"
356,zafterbir,2020-02-29,5.0,"Very close to the airport When ever we travel out of Bristol on an early flight or arrive back on late one we always stay here 
Very clean hotel, the beds are so comfortable, you have free toiletries and a hairdryer in the room and if you require breakfast or an evening snack all catered for you 
This hotel is a two minute walk from the airport"
357,UKIan,2020-03-31,3.0,"Disappointing stay I arrived at the Airport  after a delayed flight, it was 0030 when I reached the Hotel. I had already checked in and got my digital key so made my way to my chosen room.  It took a few attempts before I made it into the room.. The room was cold and unwelcoming. Initially the TV did not work but after some time I realised that the electrical lead had been removed from the back of it.
In the morning I took a shower which wet the whole of the bathroom floor and I had to use a second towel to wipe it up.
The room was average of  Travelodge standard and vastly overpriced at £96.00 for what was about a 9 hours stay. The only positive is the location especially late at night as an alternative to going into Bristol. I am a HHonors member but am unlikely to stay at this Hotel again unless the price is more competitive."
358,329ElizabethB,2020-01-31,4.0,"Hotel great - carpark nightmare I was staying overnight before flying out to Portugal next morning. My son was dropping me off at the hotel. It was dark and foggy. He drove around to car park where there was a gate and no clear drop off place. I got out of the car and went into the hotel to ask why it was so difficult to drop off. In the mean time my son drove in through barrier gate, parked and came into the hotel. The reception manager said that the process is that one should drive in ( obviously without pausing) and park. Then bring ticket into hotel for it to be verified then person dropping you off can get out of car park. My son then said goodbye and left. Not exactly an easy drop off. 
Since then we have had a ticket fine for £60 for stopping. We challenged it and showed evidence of the car park ticket. Our appeal has been rejected so, rather than have high blood pressure, we have paid. So BEWARE if you plan to be dropped off at Bristol Airport Hilton. If the hotel happens to read this perhaps they could put a warning on the booking email?"
359,Rooftop_Beach,2020-03-31,4.0,"Reasonably priced We stayed here on Sun 1st March. Quick check in at 20.00 with friendly Receptionist. We got a quiet room on the lower floor away from lifts as we requested in advance. Bed was very comfy and no noise from outside but we had a bad sleep because pillows were way too soft and flat.

Everything worked well in our room. Only hairdryer wasn't very powerful. Housekeeping had done the great job. Room was very tidy and clean.

Ideal for early morning flights at Bristol airport. You could ask for takeaway bags at reception if you wish. We check out at 4am and had a nice continental breakfast while listening to 3 Receptionists laughing and chatting pretty loud at the front desk until we left at 4.30am....Many guests were having breakfast but they all were quieter than those 3. We could hear them since the lift was opened at lobby floor 😓

Very easy to walk from the hotel to passenger terminal if it is not raining."

Arrival and check in was pleasant and swift. I was recognised as a Hilton Honours member and was given a room on 3rd floor. The rooms are very quiet and comfortable, walk in shower a great bonus.
Dinner was a basic affair with limited choice on the menu, but the food came promptly, was hot and tasty. All you could ask for really. The dining area was not too busy, but some of the tables could have been cleared and cleaned down a little quicker. Didn't have breakfast as we left at 06:15, just a juice, but the hot breakfast (starts at 6am) looked good.
All in all a pleasant relaxing stay before our early flight. Will definately stay again."

I was unable to make my flight the next morning and had to ask to book a second night at the hotel as I was too ill to travel anywhere. The reception team were fantastic in booking us in for another night and makinbg sure we stayed in the smae room so I didn't have to move, they also added a complimentary late check out for the next day.

On our final morning my husband wanted breakfast but it has closed, and Zoe from reception went and got food and drinks for him.

367,Diggy52,2020-02-29,3.0,"Exellently situated -  but food choices very poor. It would appear no one from the management team is taking the trouble to review people's comments and make improvements.   It just didn't feel like a proper hotel - the furniture and colours in the bar area were out dated, even though the hotel is only a few years old. Staff worked between the bar and reception, so there was a wait for drinks. Most of us want to start off our trip abroad with a nice meal the evening before, but you can't do this here.  The choice of food, from a tatty bar menu, was very, very poor. No chance of a proper meal and not something you would expect from a large chain hotel.  It is a shame, because the hotel is so well situated - a few minutes walk from the multi-storey car park and the terminal.
On the plus side, the food was edible, but nothing special.  The rooms were spacious and clean."
368,PaulaWare,2020-02-29,3.0,"Late arrival overnight stay  We arrived about 11 ish in the evening

Nice to at last have a hotel at Bristol airport 

Several flights of steps to go down outside to access the hotel.  Difficult with heavy suitcases.  No obvious signs for accessible entrance ....  disappointing 

Pleasant open space and warm welcome 

Had Queen size room. Felt it was designed for one occupant not a couple. Good sized comfortable bed but very close to one wall so difficult to access from one side.  

Excellent bathroom - with good shower and toiletries

Complementary breakfast from 4 to 10 made us smile.  At over £110 a night it was clearly included in the price and many early morning travellers wouldn’t want it anyway- rather grabbing something at the airport. So good marketing?

We went down to breakfast at around 9 45.  Plentiful food left with just a few gaps.  Good choice well displayed.  Had the cooked breakfast - not sure the scrambled eggs had ever seen a fresh egg, but generally OK. 

Went back to get a second coffee and toast - to find the door had been shut - and breakfast finished on the dot of 10!   So don’t be late even if you have arrived late at night!"

Wryly when booking I requested a seaview, and some resourceful employee put up a poster on the window of a beach scene, which gave us great amusement and delight.
Unfortunately a 'leak' alarm went off at 1am so we had to call for help which came quickly, but of course we were jolted awake, and then the blasted thing went off again at 2 am !! Profuse apologies were given. Then to ensure we were completely wrecked, the electric bedside alarm went off from a previous inhabitant's request, at 4am. (we had to get up for 5am, so staggered like we were like parents of newborns out of the hotel, without trying their breakfast)"

My husband had the steak pie mash peas and gravy.
I had the chicken bacon and tarragon pie with mash and peas. The pastry was hard the filling had hardly any chicken in it the sauce was dry and wasn’t rich at all. The mash was made up packet mash. For a Hilton hotel I was expecting it to be much better and home made and for the price of £15 each it was not good. 
As compensation I got a free apple crumble and ice cream and my husband a coke. The apple crumble was a bought in one and not home made it wasn’t bad but not great."

The food was very good and plentiful portions we will certainly consider the Hilton brand in future.
386,DizzyChickKimmy,2020-01-31,4.0,"Super convenient Booked directly with the hotel and Silver parking rather than as a package as cheaper. 

Parked the car and took the shuttle to the airport and then walked down the slope to the hotel, very short walk and part was under a covered walkway which lit up when you entered so felt very secure. 

Front desk staff were not overly cheerful but did offer an early morning call. Room was adequate although the bathroom could have been cleaner, particularly the shower floor. The main issue was the noise of the air con/shower fan which was rather noisy and distracting, particularly when you only booked to get some sleep before getting up at 3:30. 

As we had a very early flight we had breakfast shortly after four, very good selection, more than we were expecting for a cold breakfast and then only a short walk uphill to the airport. 

Quite expensive considering how little time you spend there but can't beat the convenience of being just a short walk away"

Check in was swift as I had used the app to choose a room earlier that day so had my key card within seconds of saying my name. It helped that there were 3 staff and only a couple of customers I guess, but its still the quickest I have ever checked in to any hotel.
Room was clean, bed was comfortable and a nice walk in shower area. Couldn't fault it.
Breakfast in the morning was only a buffet (it was 5.00AM) but it was fine.
Guess we could have gotten cheaper accommodation somewhere but it wouldn't have been anywhere near as convenient as this place.

Shines like a torch all night. Will have to take cellotape with me next time to mask it. Else difficult to sleep, and the window doesn't open. Quality of food is variable. Lots of choice for breakfast, but lots of cheap quality. A few decent quality cereals would work wonders, instead of supplying obviously the cheapest range available to caterers. will stay again because of convenient proximity to the terminal, but will go better prepared next time."

I’m fact, of you have a rented car, you don’t need to keep it for the night if staying here (!). It’s a modern place and straight forward hotel, with good beds. The shower was not completely clean though and had some hairs of previous visitor. The staff is helpful and friendly with a particular positive remark for front desk officer Jez! The food however is of mediocre quality at best. The burger meat was dry as it can be. The only positive thing I can say about the breakfast is that it starts at 4am already, so you can grab a cup of coffee and something to eat even with the earliest flights (on weekdays, in weekends it starts at 6). If you brand yourself under the Hilton name, one expects a bit more."

The food however (I think) falls well below the Hampton standard . They specialise in a “special” - curry which was well received by my colleague. I had 3 different dishes  but all appear to be prepared in advance and microwaved . Not the best . However if you’re not fussy the prices aren’t expensive. The one thing I was pleased about - lime and soda is still 50pence !😀"
405,carolmI109ZS,2019-12-31,3.0,"So disappointing Chose to stay at this hotel on our return from a Christmas break to see our daughter in France, mainly because of the proximity to the airport.  We both have walking difficulties and had been led to believe that this hotel could be approached very easily via a windy but level path.  Nobody mentioned the two flights of steps before we reached the hotel and the quite long walk to the hotel.  Never mind, we thought, nearly there.  When I booked I asked for a room close to the lift because of the problems we have walking.  You can imagine our dismay to find that our room was just about as far from the lift as you can get - right at the end of the corridor.  By this time we were tired, hot and ""cross"". 

""Lets go and get something to eat"", we thought as we had not eaten since morning and it was now around 8.00pm.   We decided  we should tell the reception staff about the disregard of our request for an accessible room and, in fairness, the young man we spoke to apologised and offered to move us - bit late by this time.  

Anyway, food.  The menu was an A4 piece of paper that listed mainly over-priced pizza, burgers and curry, none of which we eat so we decided to pay £5.50 for a cheese and tomato sandwich each.  When we went to order we were told that there could be at least a half hour wait - for a damned sandwich!  So we decided to trek back to the room and eat the crisps we had in our bags and crack open the duty free whisky instead.

We decided to try and get some sleep, only to realise that the bed was so close to the wall that neither of us could get in or out of it so I slept the night in the armchair with a dressing gown over me. Great stuff.

Breakfast was obviously going to be the highlight of our stay but, again, very disappointing as the self-service hot food wasn't and the selection was pathetic.  In fairness,  the machine coffee was quite nice and the cold food seemed quite varied.  The toaster worked well - bonus!!  The one good thing was that the lady who was clearing up could see we were struggling to collect food with a tray (its difficult to  balance plates on a tray when you walk with a stick) and asked immediately if she could help.  Our sincere thanks to her.

In short, we will not be staying at this hotel again no matter how ""close"" it is to the airport."

Room was far too hot and AC was damaged panels missing above door and panel on wall did not work. No window to open so sleep was extremely poor. Also it not clear at time of booking you need to pay £16.50 to park overnight. My wife and daughter were on a flight in the morning and I had to set off early 4:30 am so did not use Bristol airport parking which would have been more than 16.50 anyway.

Breakfast perfectly adequate and will cater for most guests I would have thought.  Didn’t try the restaurant or the bar so can’t comment.

We phoned ahead and the lady was really helpful as we were concerned we wouldn't have a room if we weren't there. They're 24 hours, so if this happens to you just phone them and they'll make sure to expect you. Also, 24 hour food menu and bar area was a godsend. The ladies on reception were absolutely brilliant and really welcoming, we were tired and hungry, and we looked like we'd been dragged through a hedge, but they made us feel at home.

Due to weather conditions our flight into Bristol was delayed by 5 1/2 hours. I telephoned reservations on landing at 23:45. Reservations agent very polite and professional and offered us a choice of rooms (lucky this was not summer as I’m sure they would have been sold out). She gave clear instructions on how to reach the hotel and even though we couldn’t see it due to foggy conditions we made our way easily- walking with suitcases about 5minutes. Warm welcome from our checkin agent and his colleague. Professional, polite and prompt with our key and instructions on WIFI and breakfast. Our twin room was very quiet, clean and comfortable and my fussy husband loved the soft pillows. Excellent hot walk in shower. Towels good quality but not 5* fluffy. Tea coffee kettle in room. Only gripe (and I have this in every hotel no matter if it’s Suoer Deluxe or B&B) was the aircon/heating - I never can find out how it works! 
Breakfast - Good help yourself choice of full English or Continental breakfast with fruit, cereals, waffles +++ Fresh tea or coffee or fruit juice to help yourself. 
I believe the hotel also has its own parking (check with hotel)

Good staff on the front desk. Lift up to rooms. We stayed in an executive room.
Big, clean room with a very very comfortable queen sized bed with two pillows each. Bathroom was also large with a shower.
Very quiet, I didn't hear any planes or other guests and had a really good sleep.
You can get a car parking ticket validated at the front desk for a reduced fee, or free if someone is just picking you up.
I'm a big fan of the airport hotel when I've got an early departure or late arrival, and I'd highly recommend the Hampton if you're not on too much of a budget.

Disliked · Very minor stuff
The signage from the terminal only says 'Hotel', not specifically Hampton. I guessed there was only this one, but it was possible that another had been built since the last Google Maps picture. Not the case, as it turns out.
Quite expensive but on par for many other airport hotels so I suppose it's just what you pay for the convenience.
Breakfast was a little all over the place - crockery didn't match the food it was near.
View into the internal courtyard of the hotel - we're from Australia so it would have been nice to look out over green English fields.
As I said, very minor things."

433,Cerig116,2019-11-30,5.0,"Excellent Stayed here last night as flying from Bristol at 7am

It’s a short walk from the airport and all car parks. Hotel also has its own small car park as well which cost me £16.50

Warm welcome on arrival. I had a great night sleep. Bed was incredibly comfortable.

Breakfast at 4.15am was ideal. Continental and plenty of choice.

Recommend this place"
434,P1278VYchristopherb,2019-11-30,4.0,"Convenient, a bit pricey  Stayed for one night ( a Sunday), booked through the app. All details were found quickly and a bottle of water and a curly whurley offered on check in. Room was clean and the heating was reasonably self explanatory to use. Walk in shower was great and the room was very quiet ( on the third floor). The continental breakfast starts at 4am and the full offering from 6am. I had the continental version, pretty much weetabix with an orange juice & a coffee. No issues on check out. Very close to the airport terminal, took 5-7 minutes to amble along. Enjoyed the convenience"
435,RI131RB,2019-11-30,3.0,"Convenient and modern  Stayed for one night while traveling from Bristol. Hotel is 800 m from the Airport and easy to find. Look and feel is very modern. Bed and linen superb, as well as amenities. I would only suggest to have better dining options, as this ""pub like"" service kind of brings down the overall feeling. Selections for lunch and dinner are limited and then you have to pay first and wait to be delivered. Breakfast was better and served in different room. I also find that Receptionist wearing jeans with mobile phone sticking out of the pocket does not fit the profile of this hotel. Must say that they were all helpful and pleasant."
436,jotimmins32,2019-11-30,5.0,"Rooms Great rooms friendly staff , nice food free breakfast from 04.00 so you can get continental before your flight , we stayed before our holiday it made travelling so relaxing definitely recommend to anyone flying from Bristol"

Upon contacting I was laughed upon, they want money. Flabbergasted I then said ok keep the booking and I will stay, answer was no not possible. Room is cancelled.

You might think cancellation was for tonight or tomorrow. It was not, it was for the 23th of december. One month to go.

Judge yourself!"
438,gemu01,2019-10-31,4.0,"Overnight stop on late return to Bristol Airport The hotel is clean, quiet and cofortable. Breakfast is OK. The pedestrian approach to the hotel from the airport is lengthy and convoluted with only a small sheltered section. If it is raining you will get wet. The most direct pedestrian way has some steps (not good for heavy cases in bad weather). There was no shaving mirror in our bathroom and the power point for razors seems to be in a most peculiar and somewhat difficult to reach position. The hotel is OK for an overnight transit,"
439,manojthatte,2019-11-30,5.0,"Fantastic hotel with great staff, amenities and rooms I stayed at this hotel in November 2019 after a long day visiting Bath and Bristol. It was a very welcoming and modern hotel that helped cheer me up. The staff was very helpful both at the time of checkin as well as during my interactions during dinner and breakfast. The food and drinks options are huge and I ended up eating at the hotel restaurant.It's walking distance to the airport terminal and looks practically brand new. The rooms are spacious and modern and the breakfast has everything you might want.Tarun was the manager when I checked in and he was very helpful."
440,xIshidax,2019-11-30,5.0,"Great Hotel crossing the street from the Terminal Booked the hotel as our flight next day was really early (6.00). Their location can be beaten, they are literally in front of the airport, 2 min walk to the terminal.
This is a clean hotel with nice staff and nice bedrooms too. 
Their breakfast starts at 04.00 am which is a very good thing too.
Price normally starts from 100€  more or less."
441,tms1987,2019-11-30,4.0,"Perfect location - Menu needs improvement  Stayed the night before our flight and it was ideal! Used clubcard vouchers so it cost hardly anything which was amazing! We were greeted by the loveliest receptionist called Than! She was super sweet, helpful and really put a smile on our face.
Room was comfy and modern. 
If you are expecting a nice meal do not hold your breath. Menu options are awful. Being a vegetarian or even not for that matter the menu is extremely limited. I ended up with a bowl nachos which I was a little gutted about but they were ok non the less.
Breakfast was good although we were too early for the hot menu the continental was still plenty.
Would stay again!"
442,PhilJJames,2019-10-31,3.0,"Adequate and expensive but convenient A 5-minute walk from the airport’s departure gates is super convenient. The hotel is modern and well-appointed in a no frills way. The breakfast (continental from 4am; cooked from 6am), was well-organised and really very good. The staff were great but the lack of a decent restaurant serving good quality food during the day and in the evening was disappointing especially as the location is somewhat remote. This hotel is definitely at the lower end of the Hilton empire."
443,neftirini,2019-11-30,4.0,Pleasant night stay The hotel is very practically located and accommodating. Reception staff very welcoming and a bonus my sister was allowed for park for free for an hour when she dropped me off. We would stay again if taking another early flight from Bristol airport.
444,Brodiejaye,2019-05-31,3.0,Place to ease the journey A place to sleep to avoid traffic at the airport. Food was limited and overpriced. Drinks expensive. We got a taxi to a local pub and had a lovely meal which was reasonably priced. Drinks we cheaper too.
445,danielpudney,2019-10-31,5.0,"One night stay before flight  First time visit here.

Enjoyed an overnight stay here on the ground level. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The room was very nice and tidy. The WiFi was fast and it was easy to connect to. The shower was warm with towels provided. 

I do like the boards of live flight times on the wall. Very helpful indeed. The location is great as it's right next door to the front of the Bristol Airport Terminal. 
 
The food and the breakfast menu was alright apart from it needed more vegetarian options to be honest. 

The only negative was there was a fire alarm on the night of stay on Sunday 27th October 2019. There was confusion on what happened. Hopefully it was a one off. 

I strongly recommend this place and I'll book again here next time."
446,topgnu,2019-09-30,4.0,"BASIC BUT NEAR THE AIRPORT AND STAFF HELPFUL My wife and I stay at this Hotel when we fly from Bristol airport. The rooms are clean and tidy and the Queen Suite is small but has a safe. Big plus is that a full buffet breakfast is provided from around 4am and very welcome for early passengers.
Although a short walk to the Terminal there is an airport shuttle bus for disabled passengers who  have booked special assistance for their flight. Rooms are very well double glazed so minimal sound."
447,RachSB,2019-10-31,5.0,"We loved it! We loved it from start to finish and would enjoy it even if not flying :)
Our family room was lovely, spacious and clean.  The bar and dining area is again clean and functional.  The walk to departures is brilliant and literally a few minutes.  The free continental breakfast we had at 4am was also really good - with a huge range of options for food and drinks.
We would definitely come back"

Every time we stay in this hotel (this is our 6th or 7th stay) we've noticed how cold our room is and the shower has to be on max hot to get decent warmth. Great location close to airport. Staff attentive. Food is acceptable. BUT You need to get the rooms warmer for clients, particularly in November."
449,BEESTRAVELLER,2019-11-30,4.0,"Good night..but beware Parking fee This newish hotel ticks all the boxes... Except for the outrageous car park fee. Booked in 10.15pm approx. Immediate check in, room very nice, spacious, good size TV. Great shower and soaps. Had a late snack.
Very cumfy bed and pillows. Breakfast good...range of choices much like other hotels  but just seemed somewhat  better so Full marks. 
Checked out just before 11am and paid for car parking.... £25 for 12 hrs.
No other choice, it is airport rates. 
I am not too happy. Hilton website states parking rate applies but not detailed. Hope they monitor these reviews. I am a Hilton Honours member."
450,jollyrobert,2019-10-31,5.0,"Superb facility, right on the airport! This was of our best experiences associated with Bristol Airport. We had one of those dreaded, early morning departures that bedevil holidays. We live in south Wales, but most holiday arrangements require journeys to other airports, rather than our preferred Cardiff, and our 10 day visit to Madeira was once such. Nevertheless we had a welcome surprise when we drove to the airport the day before our flight, having booked with Holiday Extras parking and overnight accommodation, to walk the short distance from the drop-off point at the terminal with Silver Zone parking to this well-appointed hotel. Rooms were large, beds spacious, and all spotlessly clean, and after a modestly priced meal we retired early to enjoy a restful nights sleep. Booking out early the following day at the 24 hour reseption was a doodle, then a short walk back to the terminal for our flight, but not before one of the most gruesome so-called breakfast rolls from the airports coffee bar. A tip, all the other eating places offer a slighly more expensive, but ultimately much more satifying fare. Thank goodness the Hampton gave us the best possible start to our journey."
451,Kyrano-Tracy,2019-10-31,4.0,"good location adjacent to the terminal, a big asset to the airport Glad to see a Hilton brand hotel at Bristol Airport after years of staying offsite before an early flight.

Located within easy walking distance of the terminal and the multi storey carpark it is in a great location.

The rooms are not too big but suitable for a one night stopover stay. Big reception area and breakfast from 4am!

Only negative is that the staff don't respond to emails as I was trying to find out before my stay what evening meals were available; so they lost a potential sale of four adult meals+drinks. Did get a written apology when I mentioned it, particularly annoyed as I am a Diamond HHonors member.

Would certainly recommend if you are using the airport."
452,IanW474,2019-10-31,4.0,"Excellent for an early morning flight Situated right on the airport a short walk from the terminal - and with a special inclusive deal with Silver Zone parking, ideal. The room was comfortable with a great bed and a large walk in shower - OK, we like a bath but for a night before you fly stay it was fine. I wouldn't plan to get there early in the evening specially to eat, it's quite basic.

We've stayed twice and only experienced the pre 0600 continental breakfast which was fine.

A great place to stay for an early morning flight especially if you don't want to have to worry about early morning driving and parking."
453,usagi1x,2019-10-31,4.0,"Ideal for over night stay Pros - Clean and modern rooms, swift check in, bar and restaurant on site with vegetarian and vegan options. (phew!) 
Cons - The bed was really rickety so did find it hard to sleep. There isn't really a comfortable chill area downstairs to lounge with your drinks.
All in all, perfect over night stay before a flight!"
454,tirol94,2019-10-31,2.0,"Could be Better We stayed at this hotel, before our next morning flight from Bristol Airport.
Check in experience could have been better rather slow.

Rooms quite basic and small offering shower rooms only, and quite cool.  Housekeeping could be better prepared for incoming guests.

The restaurant menu very disappointing not offering popular dishes, apart from curry.  Pies and mash, but little else appetising.  No fish and chips, they have fish cakes but they are curry rice fishcakes.  Caesar salad jacket potatoes but little else.  I know this is not the fault of this particular hotel but will be a standard Hampton Hilton menu. No cookies on arrival. 

The hotel does not have a warm feeling about it in comfort or feeling.  

The access to the airport is approx 5 mins with a partial covered walkway, but using the ramp access to the terminal makes the walk about 5 mins.  Otherwise by steps about 3 mins.

The hotel is very convenient for the airport which is what this airport needs due to its position and very few hotels in the immediate vicinity.

I would recommend this hotel for convenience only.  It needs something down with the lounge/restaurant area providing comfort and warmth. Together with an improved menu."
455,daisy_dee74,2019-10-31,3.0,"Adequate  Stayed one night before flying out. Hotel you get what you paid for . Shame room only had shower no bath, basic but get what you pay for 
For any food you need to order from bar and get drinks then find seat. Menu not extensive , food fair nothing overall special and all in same area as check in so not overall peaceful

459,danyal268,2019-07-31,4.0,Pleasant stay and convenient location I stayed at this property for one night this summer and overall I was happy with the stay. The rooms are nice and clean however there are no amenities. I didn't bring my toothbrush and the hotel had sold out of them. Luckily a shop in the airport (a short walk from the hotel) was open and I was able to buy one. One criticism is that there is no free parking for guests (something I would have expected for the price paid for the room). I would return due to the location of this property but Hilton could do better here.

It is within walking distance of the new muti storey car park and the terminal. A continental breakfast is available from 4.00am and a cooked from 6.00am. Our flight was at 6.00 so had to check in shortly after 4.00am. We got some take away bags from reception grabbed a few items plus a coffee and headed over to the terminal. Certainly will continue to use when flying from Bristol.

My only reason for not giving 5 stars  was the layout of the eating area. Separating the drinking eating and relaxing area would be much better than the open plan canteen look that is has at present.  I can recommend the pies for dinner and the breakfast was good except for the no choice of eggs.  Scrambled or none."

Apart from that we had a great stay."

Hotel is new and easy to find, leaving the car in the multi storey next door. The weather was horrendous so we were glad of the covered walkway for most of the way. 
Our room was spacious and clean, with good sized tv and decent bathroom. Also had our own aircon which was a little loud but efficient. We ate downstairs in the restaurant and although the menu is limited, the pies we had were good. Short walk to the airport in the morning and all in all it made the whole airport departure thing much less stressful. We’d stay here again without a doubt."

Have stayed here before when we have had a very early flight or come into Bristol late......the only thing I don't like is the 'sealed box' room...no opening windows (part of the reason for needing a ground floor room to be able to get out quickly if I feel claustrophobic.  Breakfast is always good. Never tried the restaurant for a meal. For a change (despite having to get up at 4.15am) I got a reasonable nights sleep as we had a nice quiet room."

My boyfriend is type 1 diabetic and suffered a really bad hypo that evening. The staff at the hotel were quick to respond bringing us anything we needed and ringing an ambulance quickly. They didn’t leave my side until they knew that my boyfriend was feeling ok and they still insisted on bringing him food and snacks to make sure he was regulating his blood sugar. I couldn’t of asked for anything better as we were travelling alone. Amazing girls that worked there! Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay close to the airport!

Staff friendly and professional.   Bar and restaurant a real let down in all ways.  A queueing system to get served and beer £4.60 a pint.  No friendly bar service.  Resturant set in the middle of a cold hotel foyer and food choice very limited.  The chicken korma was awful like out of a tin.  Top tip.   Get a taxi or walk to the airport tavern or similar pub.  It will be miles better and cheaper inc fare.  Get a tidy restaurant like premier inn and this will be a great hotel.
486,Mans666,2019-09-30,1.0,"Shocking customer service will not be booking anytime soon With the Thomas cook issues, this has resulted in the cancellation of our holiday.  As a result the requirement of our overnight stay at the Hilton Bristol airport was no longer required.  

Yes a booking was made with the best intentions so the non refundable option was chosen, who would pre plan thinking one of the biggest travel bookers would go bust.  

All they could offer was a nights stay in this hotel only which serves no benefit to anyone living 2 hours away with the intention to use only prior to going on holiday.  Would have gladly taken an offer to use a ‘in name only’ sister Hilton hotel, one that would be both practical and logical.  

To top it off the manager decided to end the call, customers are no.1 priority they say......guess not!"

Immaculate, quiet room, excellent, friendly service and a very well laid out large restaurant and bar area, with good food, young friendly and helpful staff. Works much better than the rather bleak equivalent area at the Hampton at Gatwick.

The Gatwick Hampton is essentially in the terminal, but at Bristol the hotel is a few hundred yards away, connected by steps or pedestrian ramps.

Thoroughly recommended..."

Alarm clock, iron, ironing board, lots of hanging space, shower gel, toiletries all supplied.  Good sized bathroom and fluffy towels.  The check in staff were fast and polite and check out equally so.  We didn't have the breakfast as it was a little too early in the morning.  It definitely made the start to our holiday stress free and the rooms are so quiet even in such close proximity to the airport.

492,Luigiodh,2019-09-30,2.0,"Lovely hotel, terrible food Stayed in this hotel because of its proximity to the airport. It is a beautiful new clean and spacious building. The room was really lovely, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. It was completely soundproof and made for a lovely night of sleep. 

I chose to eat there in the evening. Big mistake. It starts with trying to find a menu and then queuing to place an order before returning to a table. Several of the tables were unclean and had stray glasses and napkins even though there was no one sitting at them for a long time. 

I chose to have two appetisers and no main course. I had chicken wings and spring rolls which were possibly the most horrible dishes I have had in a hotel. 
They tasted like they were taken out of a party pack and the spring rolls were over cooked to a terrible level. Both were accompanied by a limp salad with an overripe tomato and a cursory splash of some type of dressing. 

I dreaded what breakfast would be like and it turned out to be top notch. Tasty, hot, spotlessly presented in a lovely self service area. Couldn’t fault it in any way. What a place of contradictions..."
493,jgeorge,2019-08-31,5.0,"Very comfortable hotel My wife and I stayed here both pre and post holiday flights and were very impressed. We were warmly and promptly welcomed at reception. The room was very comfortable and clean. There was a very good choice of items for breakfast ... all of good quality. 
Unfortunately my wife left a jacket behind and when I telephoned the receptionist was able to locate it and agreed to post it on to us, and would charge the cost to my credit card. We've received the jacket and as yet (a week later) have not been charged! We'd be very happy to stay here again."
494,mammababo,2019-08-31,5.0,"Airport stopover  Choose this hotel as we needed a stopover before our next flight the following day.
Very close to Airport via directions from a very kind man working in WHSmith. ( not greatly signposted from airport).
Staff very friendly, rooms comfortable, breakfast was delicious and scrambled eggs had me craving for more.
But unfortunately as we had another flight to catch my sorry little portion had to be it.. that was until 10 days later after a flight delay and resulting in our missed connecting flight onwards to Newcastle we had kindly been put back into this hotel for the night by flight company.
Again they were great, after waiting 10 minutes for the email to be received we were given our room along with vouchers for an evening meal.
Again could not fault the food.
And made sure I had a little more scrambled eggs at breakfast.
As they have flight screens around you don’t feel stressed or rushed and can relax knowing your not far from where you need to be.
We will definitely stay again even if our flight no longer leaves from Bristol but to have a look around as it looks very beautiful the country side and the people are the nicest I’ve had the pleasure to meet."

The hotel did the basics well in terms of the room size and set-up. The buffet breakfast, generally included in the room price, and good quality gym equipment were big plus points."
497,F5906KXjohnf,2019-08-31,4.0,"Really handy for airport We hadn't been here before but stayed for 2 nights between trips abroad.
The welcome was warm, the bedroom comfortable - although a darkened screen would be useful between the bedroom and bathroom.
The food was very good and areasonable choice of wine and beers.
The parking was expensive - so next time I would leave the car at Silverzone rather than park here."

501,Cheekypenguin,2019-09-30,3.0,"Convenience of an airport hotel Proximity to airport terminal is a big plus for this hotel. A short five minute walk along a clearly signposted path leads you directly into Arrivals Terminal where. My room was clean, bright an airy. A shower tray rather than a bath/shower makes getting in and out of shower easy; no need to carefully negotiate climbing over a bath. The hotel has similar amenities to other comparable budget hotels although there is a more relaxed feel here. No automated checkin machines, instead an open plan attractive reception area where friendly staff will assist you. Hotel has a drop off car park (I understand it's one hour free parking); but, if you require more time the short stay car park is cheaper. The downside to this hotel is that it doesn't have a restaurant. There is a bar menu and a relaxed open plan seating area; but the food and coffees I ordered were very disappointing indeed. Finally, it is worth joining the IHG Rewards Club as you'll get offers on room rates, and you'll be able to check in to your room sooner."
502,angreeder2017,2019-07-31,4.0,"Amazing Love this place. Clean, welcoming and spacious. Perfect to spend the night before a holiday. I felt totally relaxed here. Parking was easy too. The beers were quite expensive but I suppose that’s airport prices in general"

The staff friendly and helpful. Dinner and breakfast again exceeded expectations. In addition it is a 2 minute walk to the terminal. This place is almost as good as a main Hilton brand. We'd definately go back if visiting the area. Parking is onsite and costs £16. The website doesn't make this clear as I thought I'd have to drive offsite so again, pleasantly surprised they have their own parking despite it being operated by the airport."
505,DaisySalt,2019-08-31,4.0,"Good and convenient airport hotel Used it for the first time a couple of days ago, previously used the cheaper Town and Country down the road....
Hampton is very modern, and has all you need in an airport hotel.
Excellent breakfast included in Deal, pleasant staff.
Big single beds, good bathroom....room was a little airless though as windows couldn’t be opened.
Will use it again."
506,janpallett,2019-08-31,4.0,"Very convenient! Our family stayed here the night before an early morning flight out of Bristol airport.  The hotel in very conveniently situated about 4 or 5 mins walk from the terminal building with options of steps or slopes walkways if you have big cases.

The rooms are clean, quiet and not too warm (air con is there if you need it).  We booked a family room for 2 adults and 2 children and the only downside is that the 2 children are accommodated on a sofa bed which looks to be a very small double.  If you have bigger kids it’s a bit of a squeeze and by all accounts not the comfiest sofa bed they’ve ever slept on.

We ate in the restaurant that evening - although it was pretty busy service was quick and food was good.  The menu is mostly burgers, pizzas, ribs and such but we were happy with the choice and prices were fair.

We didn’t have breakfast before we left, preferring to get checked in and through airport security beforehand, so can’t comment on that offer.

We booked a package that included silver parking - which all worked very smoothly too and saved a little on booking separately.  Would probably stay again, depending on extra cost of a second room for our bigger kids."
507,414JulieB414,2019-07-31,1.0,"BEWARE OF HAVING EARLY MORNING CALL We Stayed here overnight before an early morning flight. We thought it would be good, we could enjoy an evening together then have a decent breakfast before our flight. We asked for an early morning call for the two rooms, fortunately I woke and looked at my watch, it was 30 minutes after the call was meant to be made. We quickly got dressed and went to the reception and asked why we hadn't had a call, apparently the had a computer  problem causing us to be left out of the calls.
We had to pick up a few items for our breakfast and run, not the pleasant morning we were expecting to have.
As this is an hotel used purely for flights I feel this was a serious mistake by them."
508,yatattack2018,2019-08-31,5.0,"Early morning flight Lovely hotel and rooms very comfortable and quiet. Had early flight so chose this on airport hotel as within walking distance to terminals (approximately 5 minute walk away). Check in easy and staff helpful and pleasant. Free breakfast with continental 4 until 6 am, then full English afterwards. Would stay here again if travelling from Bristol airport."
509,TheHannans,2019-08-31,5.0,"Late night arrival. Great nights Sleep.  As this was our first flight from Bristol, we didn’t know the airport or surroundings. Our late night flight arrived at 1am so we decided not to drive home but book a night at the only onsite hotel.

Brilliant. It’s 2 mins walk out of the terminal, and we were in bed within 15 mins of walking out of the terminal. Reception recognise weary travellers and we checked in with ease (you can do this on the app as well). 

The room was lovely, made up for a family, comfortable and spotless. In the morning, showered and refreshed we were greeted with friendly good mornings by the cleaning staff as we walked down for the excellent buffet breakfast. So much good quality choice and something for everyone.

We’d parked at the silver parking so the short walk to the terminal to catch the bus back then a quick drive back to the hotel to collect the family was quick and easy. Hotel gives you free parking for a few hrs to do this. Just validate your ticket at reception.

Overall, great option for an early or late flight. Great staff, lovely rooms and fab breakfast. We’d certainly stay again."
510,415debbiej,2019-08-31,3.0,"Limited menu and NO mayonnaise! Hotel is good and convenient for an early morning flight.  Food is basic, choice is limited and overpriced.  Pizza tastes nice but the hotel has no mayonnaise, how can a hotel not have what is a popular condiment???

would be nice if hot breakfast was served earlier so those that have paid a high rate to stay in the hotel but have an early morning flight get to have a hot breakfast before checking out, but judging by the lack of mayonnaise they probably would have run out of bacon and sausages anyway!"
511,DAZST,2019-08-31,5.0,"Overnight stay for early flight We chose this hotel as it is the closest to the Airport (just across the road), whilst not the cheapest we did not have a choice as we travelled by train and caught the Bristol Airport Flyer which was quick and easy and terminated just outside the hotel.
Hotel was very clean and the rooms excellent the airport is approx 3-4 minute walk to the Departure lounge.
We ate at the hotel and the food was excellent , whilst the choice wasn’t great the good quality was very good as well as the breakfast. Breakfast is continental style from 4am which we made use of as we had an early flight , English breakfast from 6. The beds where very comfortable and we will use this hotel again when we travel to Bristol Airport."
512,gailix,2019-08-31,5.0,Early Morning/Late Night Flight We had a 6AM flight.  Arrived the  night before to avoid an early morning long taxi ride.  Perfect location for early morning or late night stay near air port.  Quick walk from hotel to air port.  VERY convenient.
513,NYsquirrel,2019-04-30,5.0,"Clean and Convenient The Hampton Inn near Bristol Airport was a terrific place to stay.  Not only is it within walking distance of the airport (literally across the road) but it is also within driving distance of Bath and Castle Coombe, both of which we were able to visit within a day.

The hotel was immaculate.  Our room had two beds, a TV, a bathroom.  The bathroom had a sliding door entry, a toilet with buttons for flushing, and a stall shower. The shower door did not fully enclose the space, which was unusual but not terribly inconvenient. Just be aware that some water might leak out onto the floor.  The sliding entry door has an opaque piece of glass or plastic, but we noticed that shadows of someone in the bathroom can occasionally be seen from the outside of the bathroom.

We enjoyed having breakfast in the hotel's rather expansive and nice seating area.  There is a rather wide selection of hot and cold breakfast items to choose from in the buffet room with something for everyone in the family. You can also order lunch/dinner food later in the day near the front desk, where various snack items are also available to satisfy a sweet tooth.

Another great tip is that we were able to return our rental car to an Enterprise very nearby.

All in all, a very nice place to complete our trip to England. We were able to pack up and walk across the street to Bristol Airport and start our trip home.  We'll definitely remember this hotel is here for when we visit England again!"
514,benlT4786VP,2019-08-31,3.0,"Dissapointing Overnight Stay My son and I arrived at Bristol airport at 01;30, we choose the Hampton as it was the closest with a 24/7 front desk. It was no cheap at €129 for the night.

We got to the hotel at 02:00 only to find the hotel had no record of our booking despite us having a confirmation email, reference number and a holding deposit on my card. I was offered a hotel in the city centre with a taxi to and from the hotel. After  30 minutes of explaining we were collecting a car first thing from the airport and then we had a long drive they managed to find a suitable room.

That was not a good start but pretty much the worst of it. The hotel was very clean I cannot fault that at all.

The beds were OK, but there were 2 other problems. The TV didn't work, there was no signal at all and that something I can never forgive being an Englishman. The breakfast area had a large dispenser of HP Sauce BUT it was not HP Sauce.. more like cheap cash and carry sauce!! How could they do that to someone!!. The breakfast was fine and there was plenty to eat. 

I would stay there again if needed but I think I would look elsewhere first."

The hotel room was really clean and had everything we needed. The bed was really comfortable. Had an evening meal at the restaurant area. Really nice food, however a little overpriced for what it was. Snacks were very overpriced. The hotel is conveniently place right next to the terminal at the airport which took us about 10 minutes to get too with most of it being under cover. Would definitely recommend to others and would book to stay here again. Nice start to our holiday."

It's hard to fault this hotel from the minute you walk in the staff are friendly and professional. There are several flight boards near the reception showing all the flights going out of the airport. Near to the reception area is a bar and dining area as well as a small gym, there is also a counter which has essential supplies such as toiletries you may have forgotten to pack. Also close to the reception area is several computers and a printer good for printing off flight tickets. The rooms in the hotel are a good size and have everything required including free WiFi, TV, tea and coffee making facilities, safety box, the decor is to a very good standard. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel."
520,adrianl277,2019-08-31,5.0,"A Pleasant Surprise In terms of location, Hampton Bristol Airport is conveniently located across from the airport terminal.  There is clear sign inside the airport but there is no covered walkway to the hotel, and while there are step-free access, there will be steps involved.  Baggage trolley is necessary if you carry heavy suitcase.  Since it is a new Hampton, the design reflects the updated decor.  The room is on the small side so a large family has to book a larger family suite or two rooms.  However for a solo traveler, it is decent, and there is even more closet room than Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminal Two.  There is a mini fridge and a kettle inside the room, but there is no microwave.  The WIFI is easily accessible and is definitely high speed.  As a diamond member, I was offered a choice of snacks and a bottle of still or sparkling water.  

My only issue is the restaurant, in which the selections are on the weak side.  I think there are rooms for improvement.  I ended buying food from the M&S Simply Food at the arrival level.  

I have no issue staying here again if I have an early or late flight in and out of Bristol Airport!"

522,DACETC,2019-06-30,5.0,"Excellent property, nicely located This Hampton by Hilton is the best ""Hampton Inn"" property we have ever stayed in. It has all the amenities of the US properties but is a bit more upscale. The rooms were nice but no king-size beds are available, just US queen or twin. They are also smaller than in the US. The lobby is large and well decorated. There is a bar and a restaurant serving meals all day long. The same restaurant serves the Hampton breakfast but it includes a full buffet and is very well done. This was a great start to our trip to Europe after arriving from a series of flights in Bristol from Miami.
The hotel is a short walk (watch for the ramp) downhill from the airport-perhaps 200 yards/meters."

Breakfast starts at 4 am so unfortunately we missed it as we had to be at the airport at 3:20, however the staff did offer for us to come back over after we’d checked in, we decided not to do this as we felt it would be a rush.

It took me 1 week, 6 (six) attemps and some phoning and emailing to get a proper receipt that I could use to claim my expenses from my employer. The real bad thing is that this already happened 3 times when I was staying in a Hilton hotel....(and I'm not mentioning that I again did not get reward points for my stay on my Hilton Honour account!)

Very simple hotel, but it has beauty in the simplicity.  The rooms were well setup, compact but comfortable.  The bed was exceptional, possibly the best nights sleep I ever had.  Really did not want to leave, 
Desk staff super helpful, rather colourful selection of locals, super attitudes.
Breakfast had the potential to be poor, given it is the uk, non high end hotel, but I was totally wrong.  Fresh fruit, waffles, oatmeal along with full English breakfast.  I loved this place, coffee was good also."

536,henbow,2019-07-31,3.0,"Overpriced  So we left notes when booking that we would be checking between 2 and 3 am but our reservation couldn’t be found. Once that was sorted we had to struggle with two large suitcases, 3 bags and a very sleepy small child....no offer of help with our luggage at all! The room itself was clean and the bathroom was gorgeous with a very large walk in shower. The main was very comfortable but the sofa bed was impossible to sleep in and was like sleeping on a floor. I had to swap with my child so she could get some sleep but by 7am I’d had enough and needed a bit of kip so the three of crammed into the main double bed. Breakfast was lovely but the chef was very rude and miserable and couldn’t wait to shut it all up, I ended up sitting eating my food without a drink as by time I sat down the doors were closed. Check out again no assistance offered with luggage. The receptionist and manager was very polite and did give a discount when I told her of my issues. Bit ridiculous paying full price for a room though when we checked in at 3am and checked out 11am on the same day!! They really should offer special prices as I’m sure many returning from holiday need to use hotel for few hours rest before travelling home"

Checked in, we arrived at a clean, spacious twin room with perfect air con (it was warm) really comfortable beds it was  a great nights sleep.

Friendly reception and bar staff , all chatty and interested in you , rooms are clean and well appointed although thought they  may have had more USB points . 

Restaurant on site as not much elsewhere , serving Pieminister pies , which are great ."
545,pfp2013,2019-07-31,4.0,Quite conveniently located aside the airport beyond the road Located aside airport reachable by crossing the road and climbing to stairs not covered when it rains it's a must to cat h flight very early  day at 6 am. It's quite well organized offering a kind of breakfast from 5 am on but it's not that comfortable when it's cold or rainy. The inside temperature is US style with ful power AC that makes very cold the lobby and the corridors. In a true UK summer for the South European is too much. Well equipped rooms but not at the Hilton level ( no USB sockets no slippers) . Personnel very kind. AC luckily functioning also as heater in summertime for the reason s above.
546,Powellt,2019-06-30,4.0,"Perfect for a night before a flight We stayed her on June 28th the night before a flight. The hotel internally a few yards from the airport.The room was clean with all the amenities expected.
In reception there was free flavoured ice water which was appreciated on that particularly hot day.
The food menu is quite basic - burgers and pies - but fine for one night and the breakfast was more than adequate with plenty of hot and cold options.
A special mention for the staff of this hotel who were all very personable and friendly.
Will definitely use this hotel again."
547,AndrewS283,2019-07-31,4.0,"Nice hotel  Stayed for two nigjts at the Hampton found it to be good hotel.

Reception staff were very nice and welcoming room was nice although it looked onto a plant roof and car park.

Had breakfast which was okay but got very busy.

The only concerning part was the bearpit area at the front of the location they had security surrounding it and it was fenced off due to drug users and homeless people kipping there looked like a crime scene when you arrive.

Overall good stay."

549,B4187PWrobertl,2019-07-31,3.0,"Grubby We stayed here not long after it had opened. The food was awful even then  but the rooms were great and the location, obviously, a boon. Just stayed again, the food is still awful and it’s such a shame it’s been allowed to become grubby. The tables in the restaurant are sticky and not clean. I didn’t see a clean floor in the whole place. Does nobody hoover around the edges - anywhere? There was food under chairs and tables, even in the lounge bit by the exit door. 
In our room - there were toe nails on the bathroom floor and hair in the shower. The carpet was hoovered badly and, again, obviously, had not been cleaned around the edges. The bedding was clean. Had it not been 4am, and we were only staying for a few hours sleep before we drove home after a late flight, I would have phoned down to reception and would have expected them to do something about it. 
I’m not sure whether we will stay here again."

The breakfast was incredible for a complimentary service."
551,pl99ja,2019-07-31,3.0,"Early flight, room great, price good, food shocking  As the title says I am here for an early flight. The room rate was very good considering it is so close to the terminal. The keyless entry from the phone worked well and the room was really good.

The bar area was busy, not enough menus and the service slow so I ordered 2 pints in one go. The chicken wings were ok but the burger... shocking, £12 for a 1cm thick £0.20p frozen burger was awful. Worse than you get from a kebab shop at 3am. One bite and that was enough, just the smell. Of course not a member of staff to be seen.."
552,Jeffweare,2019-06-30,3.0,"overnight stop We have stayed here before and it is ideal if you have an early morning flight.  The hotel is clean and the rooms are comfortable.  However this hotel as far as the dining arrangements go is a disgrace.  We ate here before and the meal then was not good but they have managed to even make the food worse.  My wife had the pasta dish which was just about edible.  The pie I had was terrible, the presentation was shocking.  The pie was on top of a watery mashed potato and covered with mushy peas and the whole pile of food was covered in a thick almost black sauce which was conjeling quickly as it cooled.  When this was all scraped off the pie for a bought in pie it was not to bad.I did complain to the waitress but nobody came to see me despite me waiting 10 minutes. Whoever designed this presentation should never be allowed near a kitchen again.  I would stay here again but I will make other arrangements for eating.  It is a shame that this hotel does not value its customers more and pride itself on its food,"

There is a distinct service pride emanating. I have used car parking facility. A serve yourself breakfast was available as my flight departure time was 4.00am. A short walk to the Airport entrance along part covered area. A sloped incline all the way for those who cannot manage luggage up steps. I would gladly recommend this hotel."

Wi-Fi a bit iffy in some areas. Unfortunately, the restaurant menu is rather limited and the quality of food on offer could be better. 
Overall, a much better option than other accommodation around airport."
558,alex-tucker93,2019-06-30,1.0,"Disgraceful Customer Service We stayed at this hotel as we thought it would be easier to stay the night before our early flight.
Hotel is on a great location extremely close to the airport, it is very clean also. 
I booked this night stay on booking.com for £80.10, I later saw three days later while on vacation that in fact I had been charged £801 for this nights stay!!!
The hotel quickly refunded me the difference but failed to advise me via a simple phone call or email. This is completely unacceptable.
When I returned I called straight to the hotel where they advised I would receive compensation, I have chased this every day for the past two weeks via email.
Not a service you would expect from the Hilton Group.
I am still awaiting my compensation for the inconvenience...."
559,376valp,2019-06-30,4.0,"Lovely hotel, give dinner a miss! A modern hotel with excellent rooms and facilities. Beds are extremely comfortable and we found it very quiet.
Unfortunately, our experience was spoilt by a very poor and expensive dinner. A steak pie which contained hardly any meat was smothered in soggy pies and 'plonked' on top of wet, tasteless mashed potato, along with a very dry beef burger which looked and tasted like it had been reheated.
In complete contrast the early morning continental breakfast was excellent and much appreciated.
We have booked again but will look for an alternative evening meal location."

561,2Crabbers,2019-06-30,1.0,"Indefensible treatment We had booked and paid for a room months before our arrival in the early hours of June 27th, so that we had someone close to sleep to the airport upon arriving back from abroad. We flew in from Crete, having been up for 20 hours, and were ready to go straight to bed and sleep. However, when we arrived at the hotel, we were told that ""due to maintenance"" they had no room for us in the hotel. We asked why they had not e-mailed us to tell us before we arrived, but they had no answer to that. Instead they relocated us to another hotel after much discussion (Premiere Inn) in Weston, half an hours drive away! We did not arrive there for another hour and a half, and when we did finally get there (at 3am) Premiere In at first tried to charge us again. We were exhausted and yet had to wait while Premiere Inn phoned Hampton by Hilton to sort it all out. We were treated appallingly by Hampton by Hilton, and would recommend that anyone else intending to stay there thinks very carefully about our terrible treatment by this hotel."
562,nglwil,2019-06-30,5.0,"excellent place to begin a holiday Having had a very unpleasant experience at a nearby establishment on a previous early morning departure, it was a pleasure to use the Hampton. Very polite staff on reception who allocated a room swiftly and efficiently. The Room was comfortable and the walk in shower perfect for a couple with minor mobility problems. Food quality was good though the meal was a tad expensive. Breakfast at 4am was wonderful and the option to take away a paper bag of goodies for those in a hurry much appreciated. a short walk to departures and all in all a pleasant start to a holiday. We will be using  Hampton again."
563,Elbows29,2019-06-30,3.0,"Grumpy check-in staff I’d had a long week so when a mistake by Hotels.com meant we had the wrong room booked it was disappointing. Unfortunately the young lady on check-in didn’t help. Her attitude was horrible and her excuse for not helping us out made no sense. If you don’t like dealing with the public, it’s probably the wrong job. 

The hotel was very busy and the staff were stretched. Bar staff were much friendlier but they also struggled.

Unfortunately the tables in the restaurant had recently been painted so we ended up with black marks on our arms (which wouldn’t come off for two days). When we mentioned it to staff they weren’t bothered. If I’d been in an expensive suit I would have been very upset.

The room was ok but not what I had booked, I’m convinced it was the hotel’s fault. 

They also put us in an accessible room. The emergency switch is right next to the light switch so be careful if you get up in the night!"

Breakfast lets this hotel down, poor quality sausages, no fried eggs, scrambled egg tasted like it had been there for hours on the hot plate, deep fried hash browns, cheap white bread.  Not Hiltons usual standard."

The rooms are clean and a decent size and the soundproofing pretty good. In the bar the prices are reasonable and the food is standard pub fare, and priced accordingly, don't go here expecting silver spoon service, though the service overall was very good. Breakfast has a variety of choices, including make your own waffles, and the coffee from the machines is fine. Simple to find well located, we will be back."
569,combatchez,2019-06-30,3.0,"Nice room but horrid food!! We stayed the night before a flight and decided to have dinner there. Awful re heated microwave pie and mash, the pastry was hard due to being in the microwave and the gravy thick with an odd taste. 
My fish cakes were better but still had been heated up quickly as the food came out to fast to be fresh! It wouldn’t have been a problem if the prices were reflective of this but no, £35 for a pie and fish cakes with a teapot of tea!!!!
The room was nice and the staff lovely, so this def helped to make up for the food. The breakfast was very nice but tbh it was help yourself buffet so not much to go wrong.

Arrived at midday to be told i’d have to wait until 3pm to check in.... (there is nowhere to go apart from the lobby) had a bit of a grumble and 15mins later a room was made available. Good service but really shouldn’t have required the grumble.
Room was clean and modern, good internet,good A/C,nice breakfast, even had Veggie sausages. 
My biggest gripe with this hotel is the access! I was travelling alone,there are numerous flights of steps down to the hotel which is hard enough if you have a large or heavy suitcase,going back up would be impossible. No covered walkway, no concierge or trolley access to make this easier. 
The only option to get back to the airport if you have bags that you cannot carry up 2 flights of stairs is to walk to the long stay car park bus stop and wait for the bus that takes 8mins!! When the airport is 500m away max. Its crazy, they really need to address this with taking out the stairs and building ramps preferably that are covered."
572,APavl0va,2019-06-30,4.0,"Good apart from extraordinary dinner The Hotel is the most convenient at the airport.Just a few minutes walk to departures.Pleasant room with everything you might want (except earl grey tea bags)
Very nice breakfast which you can take away if you are in a hurry.Cooked option from 6am. 
Full marks for all that.A bit expensive at £110 but very convenient with a nice breakfast.
However- dinner is grim .I chose the curry which was ok.My husband chose the award winning pie.Smothered in glutinous gravy which looked like a thick chocolate sauce.The atmosphere was soulless like eating in a hospital when bad news is expected.It was cold and draughty with wide open spaces.Others eating all looked miserable.The pizza looked ok.The lighting was very dark and gloomy.Altogether I could not wait to return to the room.Perhaps they should just serve an all day breakfast and re think their food offer."

577,Tvrtuscan45,2019-06-30,4.0,"Comfortable night   A short walk from the multi-storey car park and 5 minutes with suitcases to the terminal makes this a perfectly located hotel.
  Check-in was effortless, and a pleasant experience. The room was ideal for our nights stay, clean, spacious, comfortable bed, a good shower with adequate toiletries and exceptionally quiet for an airport.
  Our only criticisms are focused on the dining area. Queuing to order food and drink is good as it avoids the usual arguments at the bar, however, not so good is the dining experience. We were hoping for a relaxing restaurant but it feels more like a fast food outlet. Food quality is average, limited on selection and poor on healthy food options. The beer choice is Boddingtons draught so I opted for a Guinness and my wife a large red wine, £16.50 was a shock, sorry a disgrace!
  This is a good hotel and perfect for the start of your holiday, improve the dining options and reduce your bar prices and you have a winner."

Only downside is the parking - expensive but then that's because it belongs to the airport and not the hotel (you get a discount but it is still 16.50 a day)."

The hotel is very smart, the rooms are ideal for a one night stay,very clean and comfortable but the pillow on the beds are a bit soft 

There's a nice bathroom with a large shower

The website states that snacks are available from the bar but you can also get a meal.

A continental breakfast is served really early with a full English breakfast available a bit later

Overall I would say that it's was exactly what I have come to expect from the Hilton group and we will book again if we have an early flight"

For this hotel at Bristol airport they will charge you to park your car overnight. When I say ‘they’ in fact I mean whoever owns the car park... it’s not the hotel so presumably it’s the airports. Otherwise it’s in a good location, it’s near the airport but on the other side to departures/arrivals and requires a trip back out onto the main, non airport roads, from one to the other.

589,diningduet,2019-05-31,4.0,"What it says on the tin You’re probably not going to get better than this for an airport hotel. All airport hotels you pay over the odds for the cost of the room, food, drinks (and if it’s Heathrow the taxi to the terminal). So it’s refreshing to discover that this hotel advertises a product and it’s pretty much what you get.
It’s located a short walk from the airport terminal. The rooms are modern and comfortable and remarkably quiet despite being so close to aircraft. I’m not sure if all rooms are the same but ours had no bath but perfectly good walk in shower. The room cost £99.
There isn’t a restaurant but the lobby serves as one with plenty tables and chairs and you can order bar food from the bar. We both had the duck oriental spring rolls to start (both large portions) then a tomato pasta with added chicken and flat bread, and, chicken Caesar salad. The mains were also substantial. With a bottle of wine the food bill came to £50 which, when you consider the last time we stayed at an airport hotel it was the Sofitel Gatwick where the meal cost almost £100, I thought it was good value.
It’s not The Ritz but it’s not pretending to be. The staff at check-in were efficient and bar staff friendly."

We arrived and put our cases in the room then went to the main looby for something to eat and drink . The prices are ridiculous £4.80 for a pint of larger what a joke but because there was no where else to eat really or drink we payed it . Plus I suppose because it is right by the airport and the Hilton they can charge these prices. So we had a larger each and a pizza ,The pizza was lovely but to this day I am convinced it was a Chicago town pizza out of a box !! The main seller for me was the breakfast it was amazing so many choices we got breakfast included ! There were cold meats fruit , pastry's the lot but due to our flight had to rush so only had a few things or would have had more .

We thought we would have a light snack in the early evening so opted for the soup of the day, which was Stilton and broccoli, served with crusty bread, the menu Is limited but ok  but the soup was tasteless and for some reason totally filled with croutons as well as the crusty bread provided and , presumably left standing from the microwave as the croutons had completely soaked all the soup up so it was a solid mass.....don’t think I would eat there again, however this aside, a very clean convenient place to stay before an early or late flight."

I live in Jersey, therefore I have no internet here and was unable to get in contact with my family from Jersey and Krakow.

I have let the 2 lovely blond receptionists at the hotel know of my difficult situation and they were very welcoming and have let me sit in the main lounge, use their WiFi, let me leave my luggage in the luggage room so I don’t have to walk around with it. I’ve managed to get in contact with my family in both Jersey and Krakow and we’re sorting it all out so that I can hopefully fly out soon. My friend who lives in Bristol finishes work at 6pm and they’ll only be able to pick me up then. 

The staff have been so kind to me, allowing me to stay here since 8am in the morning to sort everything out and I could not thank them enough for their kindness.

Whenever I’m next in Bristol I’m sure to come back and spend a night here. I 100% recommend this hotel, I have stayed in many hotels in the past and no one was quite as kind and welcoming as the 2 lovely receptionists here."

598,paulsW7483TK,2019-05-31,3.0,"Nice room. Helpful staff. Terrible food This is a bright modern hotel. The staff are all very polite and helpful. The rooms are all modern and clean. For a transit hotel at an airport it is functional but oh dear the food is cafeteria style. Very disappointing. How can you serve a starter withe the main course?  Silly me it is a cafeteria. Should have known that,  when the food was served without cutlery, and we had to find it and then find the condiment sachets as the soup was unsalted and I mean unsalted. 
For a captive audience Hilton you can do much better"
599,moonrakers,2019-05-31,4.0,"Another nice stay! Have stayed previously en route from Bristol Airport.Quick check in,nice room,efficient staff.We had a 6am flight,and the hotel does offer a continental style breakfast for early risers.We did'nt have breakfast as our sleep was more important,only to find once having left the hotel,discovered our flight had been delayed.So we could of had breakfast afterall.This was our mistake,should of checked via our phones first.In all a lovely overnight stay,and we would definately use this hotel again."
600,Plommies,2019-05-31,5.0,"Great stay between flights We arrived at Bristol airport late on Saturday and didn't get our flight home until Sunday afternoon so this hotel was the perfect option for overnight. It is a short walk from the terminal and was serving meals until 22:00. Our room was spacious, clean and tastefully decorated. The bathroom had a walk-in shower and all the shampoo/shower gel products you could need. The room was also very well insulated so no airplane noise overnight.
Breakfast the next morning was very good with a vast choice of hot and cold dishes, juices, teas and coffees and even waffles!
I can highly recommend this hotel to travellers to and from Bristol airport."
601,richardpm2013,2019-05-31,5.0,"What a discovery An excellent hotel, reasonably priced. Facilities are better than a premier inn. We were impressed by the staff, very on the ball. There was lots of space to lounge around with food or a drink. Probably not haute cuisine but nevertheless very acceptable. The room was excellent with a sofa as well as a very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom.
It is right by the airport and has a continental breakfast available at silly o'clock.
For the more serious traveller there is a free gym."
602,T7459PHmatthewb,2019-05-31,1.0,"Expensive night in a sofa bed!!! They messed up my booking. Booking 7 months in advance was not enough notice obviously.
My brother and I specifically asked for twin beds, on arrival the receptionist was very friendly, but had to give us the news that they had made a mistake and one of us would be to sleep on a sofa bed.
I think this was terrible, I don't expect to pay £120- a night to basically do the same as dosing round at a mates place.
I raised the complaint but it wasn't followed up.
I had to take time out of work to make further calls to sort this out and make management aware"
603,entrecotejay,2019-05-31,4.0,"Pre flight stay Stayed here the night before our flight.  Lovely hotel,  good value for money. Even though right by the airport,  very quiet,  never heard a single plane. Easy walk to departures. Continental breakfast starts at 4 with cooked breakfast from 6, our flight was early but was still able to grab a good breakfast. Evening meal was good,  the only negative being that there isn't a great deal of choice on the menu  (IMHO). Note it's worth joining the Hilton Honors club,  which allows you free early check in, and is free to join."

We had a slight problem, we had brought the wrong keys to the padlock for the suitcase, after explaining this to the staff 2 of them arrived at room with various instruments, they were soo lovely about it and we got it sorted and can still use the case.

We arrived around 7pm and check in was very smooth & welcoming.
Comfortable clean room, sofa bed I was told was very comfortable and the double bed my husband and I shared was also very comfortable.
We had food in the restaurant downstairs which is order at the bar.  Limited but reasonable menu which was quite quickly served even though they were quite busy.
Managed to knock my drink over which the staff immediately replaced 😁👍🏻👍🏻
Missed breakfast as we were leaving very early.
Walked across from the hotel which took less than 5 minutes to get into departures.
Will stay again."

The menu for food in the day/ evenings is limited and I thought a little bit expensive for what it was.We had time for breakfast in the morning, there was a lot to choose from, both hot and cold, and we were able to fill up and prepare for the flight."
617,hanhamv,2019-04-30,4.0,"Very good for those early morning flights Not much to add that has not already been said about the hotel itself: perfectly adequate, functional and clean, friendly staff that will get into it as their experience increases ...

Two bits of advice however:

The hotel website did tell me that there were no rooms available when I tried to make a reservation and wanted a car parking space. There does not appear to be a link between the hotel and the vast car parks that surround the airport. Book the room separately with Hilton's website and book the parking spot on Bristol Airport's website.

We were too early in the morning for a cooked breakfast so had to settle for continental - therefore I cannot comment on that aspect - however the food on the evening was not really up to standard. I am always suspicious when plates arrive 5 minutes after ordering and my wife's burger was not a good grade or that hot. It was edible but not that great. Perhaps another aspect of this hotel that will be sorted in time?

In summary, this hotel does exactly what you want it for and at a price point comparable to the other chains. Our next holiday has an early flight so already booked in again!"
618,deborahmays,2019-04-30,3.0,Stay Staff on desk and bar very inexperienced. Asked for simple things from the bar and did not have a clue what they were. An Irish coffee is world known and not one knew what it was. Asked for a captain Morgan and she'd never heard of it.  The staff just seemed to be in chaos that night
619,Simon9395,2019-04-30,5.0,"Another excellent stay. We use this onsite hotel when having early morning flights and it is perfect. Friendly staff, good sized clean rooms and good value for money. The rooms are furnished to a high standard and offer everything that you need for an overnight stay."

Both times we have had flights arriving late in the evening and knowing our hotel is less than a 5 minute walk from the terminal is a real bonus.  The rooms are spotlessly clean, large and comfortable.  There is no noise from the airport at all, which was a real relief on our first stay.  Breakfast is plentiful and of a good quality.  Staff are efficient and friendly.  It's great to know have this facility at Bristol Airport."
621,carlosthedog,2019-04-30,2.0,"Not Impressed I feel that Hilton have not shown their true colours. I’ve always been pleased with their hotels up until now. Rooms are not being cleaned properly well  certainly not the one we stayed in. Poor finish in bathrooms, hard towels very scratchy. 
Restaurant choice very poor, and limited. Staff not very helpful when serving food either. If we’d of known before we would of eaten before arriving at the hotel.  There was a new member of staff behind reception/bar looked like she had been pulled through a hedge backwards and really didn’t want to be there. 
Good location to catch flight.
Probably would choose another hotel next time."

Added bonus was we could have breakfast at 4.00am."
623,Resort492057,2019-04-30,5.0,Happy Hilton The Happy Hilton is what it should be called. The staff were of a very high standard and knowledgeable. It’s convenient to the infrastructure and our home. It’s an easy drive and easy to park which is cheaper than expected. Certainly not as expensive as others. The experience was relaxing and made me ready to fly.
624,mikeinlawrenceville,2019-04-30,5.0,"New hotel at Briston, UK, airport We stayed at the new (2 years old) Hampton at the Bristol airport in Cornwall.  We did an overnight in order to catch a very early flight.
This hotel is new and well done.  Truly, only yards (err, meters) from the Bristol airport terminal.  It had a very spacious car park, as well.
The hotel is up to the usual Hampton standards with the adder of a Euro-common bar and restaurant.  We had a good dinner.  The early breakfast was true continental style; we left too early for the ""full English breakfast"" that came later.
I would certainly recommend this hotel if you are in/out of the Bristol airport or traveling in Cornwall."
625,Z4360EMmarkh,2019-04-30,3.0,"*Warning FakeFood ALL Microwaved! Having stayed in Hiltons many times I was surprised on this trip the hotel bar at Bristol Airport that offered a full standard restaurant menu to choose from, that the dish I ordered with 2 others for family, pie mash peas gravy was cold not hot. Appearance resembled a stacked large cake. Mash potato, pie, peas, thick treacle gravy piled high on top of each each other. Like some kinda poor joke. The fact it was served COLD had us returning all three dishes for a refund of which I got.. 

I was Informed the food is actually shipped in and microwaved. They don't have a kitchen or chef on site.. So your basically getting airplane food served with your pint.

I'd love a Gordon Ramsey visit. Incredible the Hilton hotel can't operate a working kitchen and serve fresh cooked food.

So watch out as you buying pre-cooked processed pre packed rubbish. 

Mind boggles.

Very disappointed! .. Only saver is the room is spotless, service great from staff and 2 mins walk from airport and M&S food Hall ✈️🤪"

I am impressed by the gym and that every time I am in nobody is there. Definitely come Ing back/.."
627,princess027,2019-04-30,5.0,"Perfect airport stay This hotel is well located, just a few minutes walk from the airport terminal. We had an early flight so decided to stay here the night before and parked our car in the long stay car park again not too far from the hotel. 
We were greeted very quickly and warmly by the receptionist and check in was very quick. 
Our room was clean and very spacious, even though we wouldn’t be staying for long, sometimes hotel rooms can feel very cramped but it didn’t feel like this at all. 
We went downstairs for tea and was surprised how reasonably priced the food was especially for a hotel bar. The menu was good too with lots to choose from. The food came out really quick and was lovely, I had the curry which was amazing and my husband had a pizza which looked so good too. 
Had a great sleep in very comfortable beds, check out was also very easy. Breakfast starts from 4am which is really handy for those flying early. It’s not a cooked breakfast, until 5/6am, but the selection of yogurts, cereal, waffles, pastries was really good, plus you could take things away if you didn’t have time to sit and eat breakfast. 
All the little touches have been thought of for this hotel and we really couldn’t fault it.
Would definitely recommend it to anyone staying before a flight and we will definitely be staying again if we have another early flight. 
Thank you for a lovely stay"

629,TinBoxTraveller,2019-04-30,5.0,"A great place to stay if you have an early flight  Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport is stylish, clean and quiet. Better yet, it’s a two minute walk from the airport entrance via a couple of sets of steps or ramps. 

The windows are quadruple glazed, so despite being right next to the airport you’d have to have supersonic hearing to be disturbed by the activity outside.

It also has free WiFi for guests and the speed is very good in rooms and reception – perfect for allowing you to check any changes to your flight. Although you can also do this using the departure boards in the lobby area.

We booked a family room for four, which came with a double bed and sofa bed which was made up when we arrived. There was a good-sized desk and chair, TV with freeview, kettle with mugs, tea and coffee, a hairdryer, luggage stand, safe, ironing board and iron, and an alarm clock. You can get a wake up call if you want. There was even a wardrobe with lots of hanging space…I doubt that gets used often! 

In the bathroom we had a walk-in shower with toiletry dispensers.

In reception there’s a large open plan, airy seating area with a bar where you can order hot meals. We’d eaten at a service station on the way, but the smells coming from the tables made me wish we’d been able to hold on. 

Breakfast was timed to start at 4pm, so we could sit down and have continental breakfast before our 4.30am check in. So handy! 

We were really impressed with the hotel and have already booked again for our next early flight from Bristol in July."

The hotel is immediately accessible from the airport front door and the signage is clear and helpful. You literally cross the road and follow the signs and the hotel is a minute away!

I am accustomed to Hampton Inns as a long time Hilton Honors member, but this was a step up. The staff was friendly and helpful, food was available (even though it was nearly midnight!) and the room comfortable and clean. 

Highly recommend!"

There's a large bar area at this hotel, and they were showing the football which was good. Drinks are reasonably priced, we didn't try dinner however.

As a gold member, we received a bottle of water and a chocolate bar each.

The hotel is spotlessly clean and tidy and all the team were so friendly and helpful. Had some food in the bar area which was very reasonable and enjoyed a very good atmosphere. A big well done to all of the breakfast team who were in and out of the kitchen making sure all of the food was available and stocking back up if needed. The breakfast was one of the best we’ve had in a Hampton all well presented, clean and tidy with the staff checking regularly. My Daughter loved the waffle machine.

641,oswaldmoses,2019-03-31,4.0,"SPOT ON Stayed recently, having flown into Bristol airport, very convenient once you exit the arrivals doors,literally a 2 minute walk and you are at the hotel.

Check in not the friendliest , talking to a colleague whilst trying to check me in,no eye contact, or interactive chat,not the best first impression. 

Got to my room to discover it was an adjoining room,with a door,just do not like these rooms at all, you can hear all the noise from the occupants, and does not feel private enough.
Returned to reception,were the same receptionist,did move me to another room,without any fuss, which was appreciated. 

Room very clean,functional,good bathroom,everything that's required of a airport hotel room( ironing facilities in room).

Bar and food caters to a captive airport hotel crowd,but does the job,and at least this means you can get food/drinks.
Breakfast really good,lots of choice,even when busy,well staffed and replenished.

Overall this is a very good hotel,for the location, specially when flying,I would not hesitate to return,a enjoyable stay."
642,Virgo149,2019-03-31,5.0,"Great for early morning flight Stayed over before an 8.00 am flight a couple of weeks ago.  Took advantage of the room selection & digital key via the app which is very convenient.  Parked at the hotel to offload luggage - 1 hr free if you get your ticket validated at reception & then moved the car to the long stay we had pre-booked.

Room was great - clean, crisp & quiet.  Everything you need.  TV a little frustrating to operate & locate channels but no other room issues.

Had a couple of drinks & some nachos in the bar before getting some nibbles etc from M&S in the airport.  Everything reasonably priced for a captive audience.

Bed very comfortable & unusually for me, even managed a few hours sleep before an early alarm.  Water in the shower took a while to warm up but it was 4.30 am.

Free continental breakfast was fine given it’s difficult to eat at that time of day but the coffee was appreciated.

Our 2nd stay & will definitely book again if ever travelling from BRS."

We parked in the Long Stay carpark as we thought that the parking charges at the hotel were extortionate. Free bus to and from the carpark to the airport then a 3 min walk to the hotel. 
There were 2 couples in our party and we decided to have an evening meal in the hotel. We were given an electronic disc when we ordered our food which appears to have been a total waste of time...either it doesn’t work properly or the staff haven’t been trained in its use. We ordered 4 pies with chips rather than mash...after about 15 mins a waitress appeared to deliver 2 pies with mash...we told her we’d ordered them with chips...she went away then came back looking puzzled then wandered off again...10 mins later 2 pies with chips arrived with no gravy and it looked liked the peas had been scrapped off the top of the pie...we didn’t think it was ours but it was plonked down. 20 mins later a waiter appeared with 3 pies, with chips, gravy & peas and looked very confused to see that 2 of us had already eaten most of the meal...he tried to deliver 3 pies and we told him we only wanted 2...clearly our orders had been confused and the restaurant wasn’t overly busy!
Despite the farsical delivery of our food, it was nice.
We would definitely stay at this hotel again if we fly from Bristol."
652,441katrinab,2019-03-31,4.0,Incredibly close to the airport and modern rooms This hotel is only a few minutes walk from the airport. Rooms were lovely and had been fairly recently renovated. One thing we particularly liked were the plugs on both side of the bed which seems to be fairly uncommon and irritating when there aren’t any. They cater well for the market with a very early breakfast and there were lots of seats in the cafe/restaurant area. The dinner is not table service and there isn’t much choice but as airport hotels go it wasn’t bad.
653,janeh695,2019-03-31,5.0,"So comfy and quiet and prosecco Had a great night here before a weekend away. As everyone has said, the food isn't great, but it's certainly okay.  We had curry washed down with 3 bottles of prosecco! We parked at the hotel while we were away, it wasn't much different in price to other airport car parks for just 3 days as the hotel validates your ticket to get a reduced rate. It was certainly much easier parking there and having the short walk to and from the terminal, I even managed it with my mobility issues. The bed was really comfy, my only criticism of the room is one side of the bed is only about 6 inches away from the wall, there is plenty of room apart from that, just poorly designed. I would certainly stay here again. I checked in using the app. I also downloaded my room key too, so actually didn't need to go to reception at all!  
Ohh, I nearly forgot. Breakfast - an excellent choice of things to eat, I made myself a waffle with chocolate and cream on it."
654,tirol94,2019-02-28,4.0,"Very  Convenient for Airport We stayed at this hotel the night before our midday flight.
It is brilliant that Bristol Airport now has a city style hotel in the airport site.  Holiday Inn is a few mile away and Premier Inn is at Sidcot even further.

Parking on site is £15.95 a day, but you can unload the car free of charge as the parking barrier charges don’t indicate this.  Please just take the ticket and get it validated at reception.  We off loaded then drove our car to long stay then walked back to the hotel.

The rooms are quite basic and not too big, there is a walk in shower but no bath.  Tea and coffee provided but never enough perhaps one cup each provided but you can ask for more.

Restaurant ok nothing luxurious, menu could be improved but it’s the Hampton group and not just Bristol. Fish and chips or steaks not on the menu.  Drinks normal hotel prices.

 Breakfast hot and cold but only scrambled eggs not fried or poached.  Otherwise very acceptable as complimentary.

There is a partial covered walkway to the airport terminal and using the ramps takes about 5 minutes.

I would use this hotel again for its convenience, but it is expensive especially without parking."
655,Beachandsea,2019-02-28,3.0,"Great room, not so great dining. Stayed one night after a late flight arrival. Room was very well equipped with such sound proofing ! Very comfy bed, great, subdued lighting. Great bathroom and shower. Such a well designed and modern room.  Had a evening meal and breakfast following morning. Dining area feels like a large, spread out college refectory and draughty in places with entrances to hotel opening and closing. Evening meal : wife's curry was fine, my ""mother of all kind chicken and ham pie "" was pilled high and felt like a dog's dinner, so I lost my appetite. Breakfast : plenty of selection. Part of cooked items were fine but scrambled egg was dried out and sausage tasteless.

Would definitely stay here again, but would choose a different evening meal!"
656,annesA334NI,2019-02-28,5.0,"very convenient, straight forward accommodation for an early flight This hotel has only recently opened and we were keen to try it because of the number of early flights from Bristol airport.  Very easy to find, very convenient and comfortable accommodation.  Very quiet!  It's only 2 minutes walk to the terminal, outside access, not covered, so have a brolly if it is wet.  We used the silver parking as it is a bit cheaper than that directly by the hotel.  You can drive directly to the hotel, take a ticket (free for 2 hours to drop off your bags) and then park where-ever you want. Overall a good experience."
657,jeancrook,2019-02-28,5.0,"Lovely hotel very clean and fresh and so convenient Stayed here night before flight very easy check in staff very friendly and efficient, Bedroom a good size and bed very comfortable whilst the breakfast choice was excellent .

658,Lolo101010,2019-02-28,4.0,"Couldn’t be easier  We stayed here before taking an early flight the following morning and used Premier parking which is a few minutes stroll from the hotel. Easy check in by friendly staff- lovely clean comfortable room- bright spacious bar/reception area-reasonable priced drinks and a classic pub menu. ( not that suitable for vegetarians though). Complimentary continental breakfast is served from 4am which was everything you could ask for. 
Will definitely stay here again. It provided a great start to our holiday."
659,chrissandra2016,2019-02-28,4.0,"Weekend visit We have just returned from our 3rd visit to this hotel this time for a weekend. Overall a very good hotel and would like to summarise the best and not so good parts.

Best Bits

Amazingly comfortable beds (altho may be too firm for some)

Lovely hot shower with shower gel, shampoo and conditioner attached to the wall) also hand wash and body lotion supplied 

Very quiet room excellent sound proofing - we stayed at the end of a corridor room 374 so nobody walking past us all night and standing outside having conversations !

Very friendly staff - everyone we spoke to seemed happy and professional

Good breakfast - reasonable choice of hot and cold food and it was free !

Not so good bits

Very very busy on Saturday evening , tried to order some food and was told about an hour wait at 7.30pm this may not have bothered some and I know it was half term but not not too good, so good job M & S were at the terminal for a snack

Would be good to have a quiet area in a few corners at it does have a bit of a canteen feel  about the food area.

Overall good visit and would recommend a stay"
660,jwsurfwatcher,2019-02-28,4.0,"Good but  Great experience, room lovely and clean , staff first class. Only comment, considering their is nowhere else nearby, the restaurant is a bit crap!. Menu limited, ordered the burger, it was ok but I think microwaved or tasted as such anyway. Basically limited bar food and nothing else. Constructive feedback not a complaint and defiantly would stay again!"
661,joshuar2109,2019-01-31,5.0,"Excellent  I had 2,1 night stays here , one before and one after my holiday
Excellent hotel 
Cleanliness is 5 star 
Check in is easy and straight forward 
Staff are friendly and helpful 
Room
Room is clean , warm , cosy and does everything you need for a 1 night stay 
Shower is excellent with towels provided 
Bar/food

The food by night was great and again reasonably priced 
Breakfast

Plenty of choice , nice and hot 
Location 
Close to airport , steps to it are a joke , and the pathway around takes ages 
Tips, if you can hear extraction the fan in the bath room, you can turn it off by twisting the centre piece to close it off 

Would deffo recommend staying here, great hotel !!"
662,GBJ-Cookies,2019-02-28,5.0,"Great Stay Stayed here for work, as we had a meeting early next morning. Restaurant had a very basic menu, so we opted for the pie menu as they advertised them as award winning. We were not disappointed, our party of four all said how delicious they were, if a little on the cold side. The rooms are well appointed and are of a clean and modern appearance. Each room has tea, coffee and a kettle. They advertised that there was free in room movies via the television but I could not find them. The bathroom had basic toiletries and the hotel has excellent free wifi throughout. Breakfast was included in the price and starts at 4am with continental for those who have an early flight. From 6.30 they offer full English with excellent options including a waffle maker, four types of porridge, various cereals, fruit, cold meats, yogurts etc. One disappointment was that they don't offer fried eggs. All in all a very pleasant stay and only a two minute walk from the airport."
663,Sop666,2019-02-28,4.0,"Convenient for early flight. Great basic hotel, clean room, great shower and excellent breakfast included in room rate.
Our evening meal was ok, not much choice but adequate. The bar restaurant area was big and noisy. Aesthetically  unpleasing from a design point of view and felt instantly uncomfortable as we walked in. Seating and dining was uncomfortable, no low lighting for relaxing dining and it felt just like an airport waiting area. I would stay again if we had another early start as its so convenient.  Shame about the dining/ bar area being so bland, open and unwelcoming, just badly designed."
664,trevandsuebrown,2019-01-31,5.0,"Handy Holiday Hotel We stayed at the Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport in January, prior to our early morning flight to Lanzarote.

The hotel is new, and is just across from the airport.

Our room was lovely, very quiet & well decorated.  A lot of thought has gone into this hotel & breakfast is available from 04.00, very handy for early flights.

As you would expect in an airport hotel, drinks etc are quite expensive, and unless you add the drinks to your room you do not get the benefit of the HHonors points.  Apart from that, the staff are wonderful and the hotel itself is very nice."
665,earthtravelller,2019-01-31,5.0,"Perfect for Pre/Post Flight  Stay Chose this hotel as we had a 4.30am check in time at Bristol Airport.

We left our car at the airport's Silverzone parking the night before and caught their courtesy bus to the terminal from which it is a 1-2 minute walk along a walkway to the hotel.

Friendly and efficient staff on reception who gave us all the relevant information about eating options and times etc.

Room was well appointed, clean and warm without being overheated as in many establishments. Bed was very comfortable and bathroom facilities good.

Public areas bright and clean

Menu not extensive but a good variety of options at a fair price and some items available 24 hours. Portions were very generous and attractively served.

Continental breakfast is available from 4 am and included in the room rate so was ideal for us with our early check in and something we have not been able to avail ourselves of at other airport hotels in the vicinity. There was a good choice of fruit juices, cereals, porridge, yoghurts, fruit, toast, bread, croissants, muffins, spreads, ham and cheese, a variety of tea and coffee.

A quick  return 1-2 minute walk and we were back at the terminal for our check in without having had to be up hours beforehand. This hotel would also be perfect for a late arrival by air for a good night's sleep before an onward journey.

Good value for the convenience, level of facilities and service provided, we will definitely be returning in the future and will now be our hotel of choice when flying from Bristol"
666,CHELSEAFCBOY,2019-02-28,5.0,"6th time stayed at this hotel Rooms are excellent well appointed and clean the staff are lovely esp reception . Hotel is great for early morning flights and breakfast is amazing so much choice. I have had dinner in the hotel 3 times I can,t understand people moaning about choice it’s quite extensive tasty and value for money. I love this hotel keep up the great work"
667,Eddylevel,2019-02-28,4.0,Pricy Variable pricing can be a bargain - on previous visits our room cost in the region of £80 - but this visit set us back a hefty £130! And the twin room was rather cramped compared with a double room - the extra bed makes things a bit too tight for real comfort. And of course the rather indifferent food and drink in the restaurant is overpriced. So not such a good value option this time around.
668,GuyFromTheSix,2018-08-31,4.0,"A decent hotel with close proximity to Bristol Airport We arrived late in the night and left early the next day so we needed a hotel that we could get to easily near the airport. This one met our requirement. We carried our luggage from the airport to this hotel. Luckily it wasn't far.  We booked two rooms way ahead of time and had requested them to be near each other. It turned out that the rooms were in the opposite ends of the building. I asked if they could give us the rooms that were closer but the manager on duty didn't seem to bother. It wasn't a busy night, I could tell that there were quite a few empty rooms. Other staff were quite helpful. 

The rooms were clean, complimentary breakfast was good but service was questionable. That was my impression."
669,352suzanneh,2019-02-28,2.0,"4 nights for business The hotel is a typical airport hotel. Good for 1 night and don't look back. The room is nice and clean but the food is terrible. Microwave chicken and long waiting times to order at the bar. 
Parking is very expensive and there is no possibility to get a multiday pass to use several times. Each time you leave, you have to validate a ticket. Discount is very low. For 1 night of parking I had to pay £17 which makes the whole price benefit of cheaper rooms go lost."
670,415debbiej,2019-01-31,4.0,"Made an early morning flight more bearable We booked into the hotel last minute due to forecast snow and as we had an early morning flight we did not want any issues getting to the airport.  It was easy to book and is so close to the airport it was only a couple of minutes walk and we were in the airport.  We only had the option of an accessible room as all other rooms were booked.  Because of this the bathroom was more of a wet room, the problem with this was although there was a shower curtain the water ran across the bathroom floor and there was no way of mopping it up.   Also the toilet was incredibly high that neither of us could touch the floor when sat on it, and we are not particularly short!  Other than this the room was clean and spacious and staff were happy to assist us when we requested more tea and coffee etc for our room.  There is a modest menu for evening meals and food was served swiftly.  Overall this made the early morning flight so much more bearable and we would definitely stay here again although not in an accessible room next time."
671,329Damien,2019-02-28,4.0,"Very convenient Excellent location as the hotel is located just a few minutes walk from the airport (crossed the road and turned on the left)

Reasonably priced bar and restaurant and a pleasant fitness room with the usual well maintained equipments and space for free weight training. 
A good stay."
672,Uslot,2019-01-31,4.0,"Not bad for an airport hotel We stayed one night because our flight arrived so late at Bristol.  It was around 23.30. We wanted a quick check in, a beer and bed. There was a problem at check in so when we arrived people were standing around waiting.  It would have been better if someone had explained that there was a problem with the computer system but as it was we were just left standing around and not knowing what was happening,  When we got to the front of the queue the lady was very apologetic and helpful. We had wanted a drink from the bar and she offered to get the drinks while we took our bags upstairs and then we could come back down and fetch them which was good of her.  The rooms are clean and comfortable and the breakfast is good.  Only problem was they closed breakfast without warning us so we only got half way through breakfast.  Would have been better if someone had said they were going to close so we could quickly fetch what we needed instead we never got to finish breakfast. Location is excellent - right next to departures/arrivals.  Not cheap but I suppose you are paying for the location."

685,Hockers1959,2019-01-31,2.0,"Poor and very basic Stayed night of Jan 7th 2019. Reception area: like a student common room. Room: had to change rooms as the extractor fan in the bathroom was very noisy only to find the next room was the same. (Tip: wind the centre right down to close it off or you won't sleep). Heating took ages to come on and when it did, it only heated the top half of the room. The uncarpetted floor sections, including the bathroom are FREEZING so take slippers. Design of the room is poor so that only one side of the bed has a cabinet. Fittings in tbe room have a very cheap and low quality appearance. The tv system is very slow and cumbersome to the point we thought the remote control wasn't working. Plusses: good bedside light and there's a plug socket on each side of the bed which is rare. The bed was adequately comfortable.  Also, the room was clean. Would I stay there again? Hmmm, only if my flight was so early I'd really absolutely no choice."

689,MMackDevon,2018-12-31,1.0,"The staff are not interested A party of 3 adults arrived having already checked in and chosen our room online which is an option available for Hilton honours customers. We had chosen a room with 2 single beds and a sofa bed on the first floor and were given a room with a double bed and a sofa bed on the 3rd floor!!. 
The man who checked us in asked if we wanted the sofa bed making up which was a very strange question since there were 3 of us and we had specifically booked a sofa bed, perhaps he was expecting the third person to sleep in the wardrobe.

Despite the air conditioning in the room being switched off it made screeching, clunking and clicking noises every 30 minutes or so all night and kept us awake, when I mentioned this to the man at the checkout desk in the morning he simply said 'yes, we are aware there is a problem with the air con units on the third floor' and that was it, no apology or reduction in charge or anything. SO 3 very tired and cranky travellers left for an early flight having had virtually no sleep, and let's face it, that's the only reason anyone uses this hotel by the airport.
Awful service, if you know there is an issue that is going to keep people awake then DON'T ALLOCATE THE ROOMS !!!!"

Wasn't very exciting but I guess we have got used to food on the continent. We aren't sure how useful the automatic buzzer thing on the table was as it went off before the waiting staff could bring the food out and identify us - what is wrong with just giving your table number when you order at the bar? Food was tasty and reasonably priced, and the drinks were much cheaper than at the Hampton Stansted airport. Very easy to walk to from the airport. Convenient."

We had to leave early for our flight, but a buffet breakfast was available and there was a good selection of food and drink."

Only a 5 min walk from the terminal and when the multi storey car park is open it's location will be even more ideal. Breakfast is available from 4am for those super early flights.

I didn't think the beds were overly comfortable and at midnight, the fire alarm went off, disturbing me and my family from sleeping, we looked outside for answers, but were told to stay inside and weren't well informed of the matter afterwards. Also, we got overcharged for the food, which was a pain since I needed it for my holiday. The only good things (from my experience) were the food and reception staff."

Car parking no problem and the Long Stay carpark for the airport is literally one minute away.

710,oldboo123,2018-11-30,5.0,"Brilliant.  Really convenient for early flight. Stayed here overnight for an early flight the next morning to Madeira.  Parked in long stay car park and walked to Hotel.  Staff were so friendly, helpful and welcoming at reception and we were quickly booked in.  Lovely room which turned out to be very quiet and we had a good sleep.  Arranged early morning call with reception and this duly happened at agreed time.  Lovely fluffy white towels in bathroom and flannels were also provided together with quality shower gel, shampoo etc.  Went down for continental breakfast at 4am and the choice was very good. Yoghurts, Porridge, cereals, ham & cheese and lovely fresh croissants and Danish pastries. Fresh orange juice too   Check out was quick and again friendly staff on reception.  Our only slight niggle was that there was not much choice for an evening meal the night before.  Would have liked to have had lasagne or chilli con carne on the menu rather than just a curry or beef burgers but we settled for a light snack of duck spring rolls, chips and salad which was quite tasty in any event.
Beautiful, modern and clean hotel with lovely staff and we would definitely like to stay there again."

I telephoned prior to our stay - the receptionist was extremely helpful explaining how we could drive up to the front of the hotel and unload with no parking fee (for up to 1 hour)  .  This was superb. The next morning we were too early for the cooked breakfast but were delighted with the continental breakfast on offer,  an excellent start to the day (far better than anything in the airport).  We collected our airport trolley ( cost £2)  and wheeled it up to our room.  Once out of the Hotel the pathway is partly covered, having the extra weight we followed the zig zag path which led us to the airport entrance and the check in desks.  This whole process was very easy and not too arduous with all the weight.   Staff at reception were superb, and the breakfast excellent.  Have already booked prior to our next flight. We also noticed that the Hotel backs onto the onsite long-stay parking, so will use that next time.   Staying at this Hotel takes the stress out of travelling by air.  Congratulations and Thank you to all the staff."

The restaurant food was good, although limited on choice, however the speed of service was really fast. Drinks in the bar were a little expensive.

Use Silver Parking rather than the hotel if you want to keep cost down

Room was clean and double bed very comfortable just not what we'd booked. Breakfast finishes at 1000 and the doors were pulled over very promptly, so need to ensure down in plenty of time.

Modern corporate hotel still shining after being in operation for less than two years,
Friendly staff on reception quickly checked me in and I was in my room in less than 10 minutes.
The room was bright , well appointed , spacious with a very comfortable bed... on which we had feather pillows ... with really good reading lights beside the bed. 
The ""restaurant"" was the only let down. More like a canteen than a restaurant with a very limited menu which had sold out (830pm) of my first choice.
My duck spring rolls were to be served with Hoisin sauce but arrived with sweet chilli ... not what I expected but still adequate. Main was penne with a rich tomato sauce and a breast of chicken.. again okay ."
719,Wonderland8814,2018-11-30,3.0,"Lack of personal touch  My husband booked this hotel the night before we flew to Venice and had arranged for Prosecco to be put in the room as it was my 30th birthday. When we arrived no Prosecco had been put in, so he asked about it and they said “oh yes we can see a drinks voucher has been applied to your account, well send the Prosecco up now”. No Prosecco arrived. It got to 11pm and we gave up and went to sleep! 

The room itself had been set up for two separate travellers not a couple. They had pulled out and made the sofa bed to make a second double bed, leaving no room to move about in the room. 

The hotel itself was clean and modern as you’d expect being brand new almost. The bar was set out nicely. But wouldn’t order food again as it was almost empty when we arrived and it took 50 minutes for our nachos to arrive. 

I would stay again as it’s convenient but I wouldn’t have expectations for any else other than a place to rest your head before an early flight next time."

721,Abroadman,2018-11-30,3.0,"A Reasonable Hotel with ups and downs The reception staff were friendly and welcoming. The room was clean, tidy and comfortable. It was well insulated, climate controlled and there was no aircraft noise, although a higher quality toilet paper would have been appreciated. The dinner was simple fare, but perfectly acceptable, and the bar area had USB charging for phones and tablets. The breakfast was small and simple with 6 hot items plus 2 cold trays for meat and cheese, however unfortunately the hotel could not cater for the number of guests and most food trays - bacon, eggs, cheese, sausages, beans - were empty. The guests waiting were told more would come, but that the kitchen was only set up to make one item at a time so they would have to be patient. Quality of food when it did arrive was relatively poor. Parking for hotel guests was charged as a £16.50 per night extra. Overall, it is a reasonable hotel if you have modest expectations. Location and staff are definitely the strong points here.

722,kazzb2016,2018-10-31,4.0,"One night before flight This is a ‘fit for purpose’ hotel, in that it is ideally situated at Bristol Airport for flights both in and out. We had to drop a hire car off here and then fly to Ireland so it was perfect for us. The standard is good throughout with everything you might need for a one night stay. The rooms are a good size and clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. It has a fairly basic bistro offering for food which was fine for us. The food was good and hot. Breakfast was basic but adequate before a flight. We liked the ability to buy snacks from the bar. A note that might be helpful is that if you have a lot of luggage for the flight you do have to negotiate a couple of ramps up to the airport as the hotel is much lower etc."
723,Tomsk167,2018-11-30,3.0,"One night stay after cancelled flight Clean and friendly hotel. breakfast starts very early  - good for early flights. BUT, why do you not provide quality decaffeinated coffee? Only sachets of nescafe  decaf which tastes like c**p. Also no water bottles in rooms."
724,D6920SVpatrickb,2018-10-31,3.0,"Definitely not a Hilton, useful for pre travel overnight stay. I do not see the connection here with the quality chain of Hilton hotels, in my opinion this is a backward step. Hilton, if you value your brand, drop the Hilton reference from the name!. The reception staff here are full of their own importance as they try to carry out the basic courtesy of serving the paying client.
This is a very modern box with rooms and little else to say about it. As it is a new hotel the rooms are clean and basic for an overnight stay. Food is also verging on bland and not very well presented. Expensive for what is on offer.
Would I stay here again? yes, solely because it is the nearest hotel to the airport terminal."
725,jeffswork,2018-11-30,3.0,"Handy for airport Stayed for one night and like 99% of the people there I was there for an early flight. Signage from the car park to the hotel could be improved but when you get there you find a new shiny, yet basic hotel. Staff at check in were not too friendly and totally forgot to mention or acknowledge my Hilton Diamond status. Rooms are basic but functional, bar area pretty much the same. Prices are low for drinks, more like pub pricing than hotel, which was nice.
Breakfast was basic to say the least, probably even below that of Holiday Inn express. They do serve hot food, but it’s low quality.

Walk to terminal is 5 mins and there is a covered walkway partially too, so even in bad weather it’s pretty easy.

I would use this hotel again, but that’s for its location, not as it’s a great hotel!"
726,224jkg,2018-11-30,2.0,"Good service, noisy air-con The service was good, the food was fine, and the beds comfortable. However the room was appalling, for just one reason: the noise of the air conditioning. Every couple of hours it would let out a 1-2 second blast of noise, sometimes followed by a couple of minutes of rattling. The only reason to stay at this hotel was to get an extra hour of sleep before a 4am check in. I was awakened at midnight and again just after 2am. Defeated the purpose of staying here. Complaining and changing rooms at midnight would have been even more disruptive and robbed me of even more sleep. This problem is mentioned in several reviews, going back months. Had it not been for this major flaw, I’d be happy to rate my stay as very good."

728,348angelb,2018-10-31,1.0,"Fraud at the hotel reception On October 18 I arrived in Bristol at night. I went to the Hampton hotel. H. Bristol Airport where I thought I had a reservation.
I made online  reservation several weeks before. This reservation had an error as it was for the Hampton hotel but for Bristol City.
The hotel receptionist was very ""friendly"" and she telephoned the Hotel Bristol City Center and canceled our reservation. Then she used my credit card and charged my account for the room at the Hampton Bristol Airport hotel, which was where we spent the night. 
They answered:  have spoken to the team on duty on the evening of the 18th and no one recalls receiving a call from the Hampton Bristol Airport I’m afraid.
 
As the booking was made through a third party, we would have been unable to cancel the booking without the authorisation of the third party.
 
I apologise if you were given the wrong information when you called, but without talking to Booking.com and cancelling the reservation through them we would not be able to waive the no-show charges.
I do not understand why that call does not appear in the hotel reception.
So, were we cheated by that employee?
If so, as you say, I'm going to write a critique in trip-advisor, showing my disagreement.

El 18 de octubre llegué a Bristol por la noche. Fui al hotel Hampton. H. Aeropuerto de Bristol donde pensé que tenía una reserva.Hice la reserva online varias semanas antes. Esta reserva tenía un error, ya que era para el hotel Hampton pero para Bristol City. La recepcionista del hotel fue muy ""amable"" y llamó al Hotel Bristol City Center y canceló nuestra reserva. Luego usó mi tarjeta de crédito y cobró a mi cuenta la habitación en el hotel Hampton Bristol Airport, que fue donde pasamos la noche.
Hice una reclamación cuando vi que me habían cobrado la noche en los 2 hoteles y ellos me contestaron que habían hablado con el equipo de servicio la tarde del 18 y nadie recuerda haber recibido una llamada del aeropuerto Hampton Bristol.
 
No entiendo por qué esa llamada no aparece en la recepción del hotel.
Entonces, ¿fuimos engañados por esa empleada de recepción?

Me siento engañado y quiero mostrar mi desacuerdo.
No volveré a ningún hotel de esta cadena."
729,DevonAdorable,2018-11-30,3.0,"Positives and Negatives I chose to stay because I had an early flight and it is close to the Terminal.
The single beds were wide, the room was clean however it lacked an easy chair to sit in.  The room was relatively quiet.
The Continental Breakfast offered a variety of choices.
I was very disappointed with the very limited choice that the complimentary tray presented; 5 Nescafe sachets, 5 Twining’s Breakfast tea sachets, sweeteners, sugar and a few small milks. No choice of teas, no hot chocolate, nothing else.  Maybe I could have gone down to reception, asked for different teas & been given some but after a journey delayed by an accident on the motorway all I wanted was to be able to get a drink in the room without any fuss.  Fortunately I had brought some of my own tea bags with me.  The choice was as limited as I have found anywhere and in view of the cost of the room I am marking the hotel down for it.  
Reception told me that the parking they offer at £16.50 a night on their website is only for the night you stay at the hotel, any other night is much more expensive.  That car park is the closest to the hotel and when I stayed was almost empty.  Premier car park was almost full and it seems a shame to have such underused facilities that close to the hotel."

We did not hear 1 plane during our 1 night stay. The staff on both the reception and the bar/food areas were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again."
731,GunillaB190,2018-11-30,3.0,"Nice hotel but not great for familirs We stayed at the Hampton by Hilton for one night as we had an eatly flight the next morning.
It is a clean and nice looking hotel and we liked the bar and restaurant area. To cater more for families with small children it would have been grwat witha small little playroom or such but unfortunately there isn’t any of that. 

Thought the food was fine and sufficient choice for both adults and kids. Did not get to try the hot buffet breakfast but only continental as our flight was too early. But we were happy with what was on offer.

The biggest reason to why our rating comes down was the extremely uncomfortablr fold out sofabed. We were two adults and two children and we slept one parent and one baby in that rock hard bed and it was horrendous. I really think the hotel should invest in better pullout beds or at least put on an extra mattress or something. The main double bed was fine and comfy though so if there are obly two of you will prob have a nice stay. But that extrabed was so hard that we would definately think twice about staying in this hotel again as a family at least.

Another slight minus is the website which is rubbish.

Other that that, good hotel and friendly staff (they were very forthcoming and helpful when our little three-year-old locked herself in the bathroom and then was unable to unlock it again....)"
732,FionaW1694,2018-10-31,5.0,"Happy customer- excellent service Stayed here with work, due to having an early flight home. Staff were amazing, having had an extremely long day at work, they accommodated my need for a quiet room on the ground level. Room was extremely clean and beds are very comfortable. Amazing nights sleep. Food smelt amazing, but did not have time in the morning, however with the amount of people sitting down for breakfast, I would safely say food must be good. Would recommend this hotel to anyone, especially for early morning flights and will say due to proximity to the airport, it is not one bit noisy."
733,115suk,2018-03-31,3.0,"Location Location Location I have read all the reviews on this place.  I have not got much to add except it’s really only good for one thing.  Slap bang opposite departures!

I wonder, how can it possibly get such a wide range of reviews from “terrible” to “outstanding”?? Can these be reviews of the same place?

Must just be a bit of a lottery? Depending on which staff are on? Which room you are lucky or unlucky enough to get? (Clearly avoid room 142!  Or room 8!) ....or on How busy it is?   

Reading between the lines this place was chucked up to make money.  Hence the countless complaints about noisy air con and defective plumbing.  And it’s pretty clear that there are not enough staff, and those that there are are probably underpaid, undervalued, demoralised at all the problems that they are powerless to fix, and have a horrible time trying to cope. No wonder they might be rude sometimes. Or, at best, just don’t seem to care.

I stayed here in March. To save getting up at 2am and driving up for the dreaded early flight. Just like very many of the reviewers. So I am already saving a poor night’s sleep and potentially awful night-time drive. Staff were so-so.  Not bad. Not great either.  Room was a clean bare box. Can’t recall if it was noisy or not.  

Did not use the aircon. Saved the shower for my proper4* Spanish hotel.  Spain knows how to do hotel accommodation.  We don’t. 

Ate my own sandwiches and snacks. These were clearly all wise choices.  Grabbed a coffee and croissant at 4.30am.  Both were ok. 

Saved myself for the decent food I knew I’d get at any one of the inexpensive Spanish cafe bars next day. For a fraction of our rip-off prices.  Knew too that I could get get great Costa coffee and toast quite cheaply in the airport. Just before boarding. Perfect. 

If, despite the really bad reviews you decide to “go for it” at this funny hotel, do so just because it really is very nice to just trot over to departures in a couple of minutes. And that’s all! 

And, I recommend that you:-

1. Don’t eat an evening meal here.
2. Pay APH parking in advance.
3. Bring earplugs, 
      & don’t bother to shower...
4. Be prepared for a slow check in.
5. Don’t expect pleasant staff, then you can only be pleasantly surprised.
6. Just stay for the location - nothing else.  
7. Be philosophical. Expect middling to bad. Expect soulless. It’s UK!  Everything about England is substandard and a rip-off, right? 
8. And don’t forget those earplugs!

Then you might say - “hey, it’s basic, it’s a classic UK rip-off, but it served its purpose”. 

Expect poor quality if you stay in accommodation in England..  especially at any airport hotels. I’ve stayed at two others near Bristol.  Both were dire!

They are all just factories for us susceptible 2nd class citizens who happen to be air travellers. 

If we could afford better we’d not be catching flights at silly-o-Clock... or we’d get picked up and dropped off at the airport by taxi, right? 

Expect substandard.  That way you can only be pleasantly surprised if anything is better than average..  or even, dare I say it, nice?"
734,Ali_bridger,2018-11-30,4.0,"Quick stop Stopped here for one night before flying early to Spain. Check in was seamless, very efficient. The room was lovely. Very quiet and comfortable bed, but could have done with firmer pillows. The resturant/bar was nice and spacious you didn't feel like you were sitting in the lap of the table next to you. Drinks aren't cheap but what else do you expect as they have a captive market (but they were by no means over priced). The food was good, great portion sizes there was no feeling of being short changed and it came out piping hot. The only gripe I had was that the floor and table were grubby. 
WiFi is fast and easy to connect to. 
All the staff we had contact with we're friending and efficient. 
If we visit again we will look into getting an extra night in the airport parking as having to pay 16.50 for just a few hours we though was a bit much, but hey ho we should have expected it to be a bit like that."

There is a walkway from the terminal but for disabled passengers like myself the long term car park bus will make a detour to drop off and pick up travellers.
Reception staff were delightful and helpful and we even got a drink to calm our nerves at 12.30 after a landing in horrendous conditions ! The rooms are perfectly suitable for an overnight stay with good shower and tea/coffee making facility. Beds were excellent.
Breakfasts both full and early continental were above average and perhaps the only criticism, as mentioned in several reviews, is the very minimalistic retaurant menu."

Cool.
739,Ziggyblue,2018-10-31,3.0,"Good Hotel Let Down By Food I am a regular visitor to Bristol Airport and always stay at the Hilton for the convenience.  However every time I am disappointed with the Menu and evening meal.

I was absolutely starving and as the menu is very limited I bought I would choose the burger again despite having a really bad one previously, surely it couldn’t be as bad.  Oh yes it could.  Despite requesting it be cooked medium rare I was told that was impossible. Why!  It arrived and was like shoe leather. Awful. Dry and tasteless.  However, the chips and salad were delicious but a lot of money to pay for chips and salad.  I would however mention a member of staff, Rebecca, with who. I discussed my concerns.  She was extremely helpful and said she would speak to the GM about this in the morning. 

Why oh why cannot you offer a decent menu with well cooked food.  The Holiday Inn down the road manage to do so so why can’t the Hilton.  

Such a shame as everything else is good."

The room was lovely - clean and very comfortable, as was the huge bed! 
We needed to check out at 5am, so I was wary of what breakfast would be available at that time. It was fabulous! Everything you would want - just wished we had more time! Cooked breakfast would be available from 06.00 which we missed, but that really didn't matter.

744,746fionaj,2018-10-31,5.0,"Excellent customer service & lovely hotel What a fantastic hotel. Deserving a particular mention Lorraine on the front desk was friendly & accommodating helping us with information. All with a lovely smile on her face - was such a nice welcome back to the UK.

The hotel was immaculate, good room sizes , excellent breakfast & convenient setting.

Would thoroughly recommend."
745,DavidBK,2018-10-31,4.0,"On airport Good clean and modern basic hotel. The rooms are small but ok for overnight stay. Very minimal choice of food for dinner, although it was good quality. Breakfast was good but the cooked breakfast was not ready at six o’clock so we missed out, however the continental breakfast was adequate. Would stay again if an early flight otherwise would stay elsewhere."
746,AMBHAMP,2018-10-31,4.0,Second  stay Comfortable rooms with good beds and soundproofing. Nice bathroom. Great location for early morning flights. Breakfast has plenty of variety. Lounge area is modern and clean but perhaps there should be more comfortable seating available. Check in and check out quick and efficient.
747,fisheatingveggie,2018-10-31,2.0,"Good location for airport but quality of room not for us. Stayed for one night before an early Bristol airport flight. Pleasant staff at check in.

You don't need a large room and ours was fine but the layout was not! To quote another reviewer (because I cannot improve on it): ""why on earth would you have a bed that was about a foot off a wall on one side so it’s hard to move between them and get in and out of it and on the other side a massive space that has a corner couch, a desk. chair etc. The corner shelf on the side of the bed against the wall holds a cube clock and a glass if you’re lucky, too small and impractical!!"" 

Our main issues were the bed and the air con. We like a firm mattress but this one (presumably quite new) was rock hard. The air con was noisy but, as usual, the windows don't open so no choice but to use it.  For both these issues, if we had been staying more than one night, we would have asked to move rooms.

The bathroom was fine, being nice and clean but, also to echo a previous reviewer,  why is the toilet roll holder so low to the floor? It needs to be about a foot higher up the wall. As it was ours wasn't 100% level so there were many scenes from an Andrex advert!

We found the evening food in the bar area and the  breakfast all very adequate for the occasion.

All in all the hotel is well located and generally well laid out, but sadly I can't honestly say we would stay again and therefore cannot recommend it."
748,llovetravelling,2018-10-31,4.0,"Three minutes walk to the terminal. Lovely modern and seemingly quite new  hotel. Good comfortable  bed, room was clean, light and spacious . Very nice bathroom. Towels sadly lacking, not really as white as they should be, a little thin/ tired looking and one had dark grey spots on it so at 11pm at night and having just got out of the shower had to use my husbands already wet one. Sadly no USB ports anywhere to be seen for charging phones/tablets etc. A slight let down in a new hotel. Decent enough breakfast included in the price. Excelllent proximity to Airport, just a few minutes walk and you are in arrivals. Easy access also to car park and reasonable size spaces. Would definitely recommend & stay here again."
749,Skas07,2018-10-31,5.0,Comfortable start to holiday  We stayed here the night before our holiday. A lovely clean hotel and the rooms are very comfortable. We had a view of the airport and it was very quiet so had a good nights sleep. There is no where decent really to eat nearby and the restaurant looks like it was going to have a good selection for dinner so was surprised the menu had more of a snack choice. This was the only thing I can say negative. Thank you for a comfortable start to my holiday

Short walk to the terminal.
Good food.

We will stay here again when travelling out of Bristol.  If you have a car, book the silver zone for an extra night because the hotel parking is expensive.  That really is the only negative.

Thank you"
752,whitcop,2018-09-30,4.0,Good overnight stay We stayed at the Hampton by Hilton as we had a 4AM check in or our flight.  We had a comfortable clean room on the 1st floor facing the terminal building. No problems with any noise.  There is a free breakfast but we checked out before it was available. The dinner menu is not huge and mainly has Pizzas or burger type food.  We would have liked to see a bigger choice of food available.  Just a few minutes walk to the terminal.

755,108carolf,2018-10-31,3.0,"Good value  Stayed for one night (a Friday) 2 of us.
Clean and comfortable, nice room but small, shower very weak but adequate.
Breakfast was in the price, basic but busy if you choose to go later than 8-9 am but they do advise this. If your fussy then don’t bother with breakfast but if not then there’s plenty of it but quality basic.
Parking in the NCP st. James next door was expensive,18 hours with 20% off was £18.50 so you will need to factor that in.
Location was very good, 5 mins walk to waterfront bars and restaurants so we thought was worth it,would stay again though."
756,jetbirdme,2018-09-30,4.0,A very good transit hotel Only 5 minutes walk to the departure and arrival sections of Bristol Airport. Some bedrooms have a good view of the english country. Rooms are well planed and the beds are comfortable. However you cannot open windows and the air conditionned is not 100%. The restaurant is good with simple dishes but no fish and chips ! Staff was helpful. The hotel is very new !

759,1952rcutler,2018-09-30,4.0,"Comfortable airport hotel  We stayed here as we had a very early flight out of Bristol (6am) and didn’t fancy a 3am drive & park or a taxi journey. 
Staff on Reception gave a friendly welcome, the standard of our room was very good, quiet with no aircraft noise. 
Because of the early start we were unable to have breakfast, although Reception had said it was ok to grab a takeaway, unfortunately at 3.50am no food was available. 
With around 30 flights departing before 7am and as such a very busy check-in period, perhaps the hotel could consider an earlier continental breakfast start time of say 3.30?"
760,Little_Me_2006,2018-09-30,2.0,"Poor Had to change rooms
On arrival which was s shame because first impressions were good... but the room wasn’t up to standard
Key was given in half a cut up envelope which wasn’t impressive
Rooms are basic and uncomfortable 
The air con is very loud and in general there are multiple noises going on from neighbours and plumbing and sporadic gremlins creeping through the air on
It isn’t restful to say the least
The bathroom shower had a rod stabilising the shower panel to the wall which if your a certain height over 6ft really doesn’t make it comfortable
My toilet roll holder was broken and my key operated electric point panel fell off the wall upon arrival
Various times during my few nights stay the place stank of fish/glue/bad plumbing 
The food on offer is beyond abysmal
I’m not sure who the staff are employed by or if many are students but no one seemed to have any idea what they were doing, even purchasing a meal wasn’t simple. Bar staff couldn’t operate the till, had to ask for help on multiple occasions and the word ‘please’ didn’t seem to be in their vocab
Also being ignored at the bar by someone clearly doing precisely nothing is beyond irritating 
I wouldn’t recommend staying here and wouldn’t want to return
I don’t think having to wear earplugs because of the constant banging and plumbing noises is a great hotel experience!"
761,martinbJ9614OJ,2018-09-30,4.0,"Late arrival In a walking distance from the airport, easy to find, good choice to stay for early flight or late arrival. 
Friendly receptionist. Quite fast check in.
Room was clean and cozy.
Vide choices for breakfast."
762,Raptormad,2018-09-30,4.0,"A comfortable airport hotel but access is poor! There is always a level of comfort and calming rooms at Hilton airport Hotels. 
Having said that...  who on earth designed the bedrooms?? 
Why on earth would you have a bed that was about a foot off a wall on one side so it’s hard to move between them and get in and out of it and on the other side a massive space that has a corner couch. a desk. chair etc. 
The corner shelf on the side of the bed against the wall holds a cube clock and a glass if you’re lucky, too small and impractical!! 
The bathroom/ wardrobe door is very heavy, once moving it could easily trap a hand in it. 
I’m intrigued that the toilet roll holder is so low to the floor!!  It needs to be about a foot higher up the wall!! 
The toiletries and towels provided are good and the shower is great. 
Food in the restaurant area could give a better variety of choice, it’s a bit basic to say the least. 
Access to the hotel is badly sign posted from the Parking areas, that certainly needs improving. The new stair access is fine but why is there not a ramp for those with mobility problems there as well. The existing airport ramps have to be used which means walking further than need be!! 
Why isn’t there an entrance onto the road level from the hotel so that there is a direct access on the same level as the terminal? 
It’s a comfortable hotel, but whoever designed it really has not thought it through !! 
It needs some consideration for those with reduced mobility!"
763,housered,2018-09-30,5.0,"Exceeded our expectations,  loved it! Booked last minute anticipating (correctly) a delayed late evening inbound flight. It was a delight to arrive tired and teasy to a cheerful welcome, an open bar and then immerse ourselves in this pristine, modern space. Breakfast also exceeded expectations and the room was really comfortable. Staff were all engaging and helpful - well done Mr Hilton! One point that maybe worth looking at is the outdoor  lighting at night as you come down the stairs from the terminal before you enter the covered walkway."
764,AlisonT165,2018-09-30,2.0,"Not good You would only come to this hotel before or after a flight, but don't as there is nothing around to provide you with other eating or drinking options. The choice of food is extremely limited, served luke warm and the boil in the bag colourless chicken is just unappetising. On top of that the bar and eating area was uncomfortably cold. Like other guest we retreated to our rooms at 7pm disappointed. Even for an airport hotel it is not worth the money at £130 per night."
765,Jeffweare,2018-08-31,3.0,"Holiday This hotel is ideal if you need to stop before or after a flight.  It is only a short walk to terminal and  is situated well for the long term car park if  you are lucky to park at that end of it.  The staff are pleasant and efficient.  The rooms were clean and the bathroom good with an excellent shower. Wake up call was on time as well as there being an excellent alarm clock in the room.  The coffee provided was very limited and some biscuits would have been appreciated.  The bar and restaurant area is very large with many tables.  The menu is very limited consisting of mainly burger, curry, pizza, jacket potato and sandwiches.  My wife had the jacket potato with tuna and sweetcorn, the potato was only a half and was dry and grey looking and at a cost of £7 overpriced.  I had the burger and what a disaster this was .  It was made of ground meat and was utterly tasteless, with cheese and bacon the cost of £12.95 was a complete rip off.  You would expect more choice and quality for a hotel carrying the Hilton name.  The bar prices are what you would expect from a hotel with a captive audience ,HIGH.  I would stay here again because it is convenient for the terminal and parking but I will eat somewhere else before arriving.  I would also suggest taking your own water as £1.90 for a small bottle is another rip off."

770,hazelr97,2018-09-30,4.0,"Ideal location We booked this hotel as it was close proximity to the airport and we had a early start in the morning. Having flown from Bristol many times we knew the exact location, however, having a substandard experience at the Hilton Gatwick our expectations were not high. That said, although the general ambience, cleanliness of the bijou hotel room exceeded our expectations the food on the other hand in the evening was basic but adequate and the meal was hot and served quickly. The staff on the whole were friendly and efficient but has to be said the girl with the Lilac hair was by far the best displaying a great deal of customer service  I would stay again as the location makes up for shortcomings on the food that’s on offer throughout the day."
771,neathmickey,2018-09-30,4.0,"Nice hotel Just stayed for one night on the 11th sept 2018. The hotel is a nice comfortable hotel and ideal for a short stay. We enjoyed the breakfast with plenty of choice.
We didn’t eat in the restaurant as we tried it last year and found the menu limited and service not great.

Downside of the hotel was the noise from the plumbing and the air conditioner was noisy with what seemed to be relays clicking in and out on a regular basis.

We do find that getting heavy cases to the hotel can be quite hard especially as we are in our late sixties. However we found that if you go to long stay car park stop G which is opposite the main entrance you are allowed to take the shuttle bus back and forth, this was a huge benefit."

Room was lovely, comfortable and very clean, couldn’t have faulted it. However this was soon let down by the restaurant (if you could call it that) there were very few poor choices of simple but expensive bar snacks, we chose Nachos which were appalling, sloppy and cold and drenched in what appeared to be tomato ketchup rather than a proper salsa. Didn’t bother ordering anything else as the only choice was burgers and the table next to us were complaining to the waitress about their burgers. The bar staff were very slow with our drinks because they were so busy gossiping amongst themselves, our expensive cocktails were eventually delivered to our table which the waitress then spilled all over the place with no apology, no offer of clearing up the mess or topping up the cocktails that she spilled. When going to the bar again I was asked if I knew what measurement my Baileys should be !!  Clearly inexperienced and lacking in training, pretty disappointing for what we spent."

Breakfast was very good and easily accessible.  Particularly impressed by the pour your own waffles.  
Very close to the airport, easy to find and perfect for a one night stopover.  The only negative is that considering the price of booking the room one nights parking is very expensive our advice is consider staying one extra night in the long stay car park.
Overall a lovely nights stay."

783,Shanzusam,2018-09-30,4.0,"CONVENIENT We stayed the night at Hampton with our children and grandchildren prior to an early morning flight. We parked at the adjacent multi-floor car park, an arrangement that proved ideal. The hotel impressed, in all but one regard - clean and efficiently run by friendly staff who coped very well with a number of issues we witnessed - a medical emergency among them. However, the service in the restaurant was, as we were warned by Trip Advisor, disappointingly slow at a busy time. We waited for over an hour for the ice cream that came with one child's meal. This was a pity, because although the menu was limited, the food proved surprisingly good and the main course was delivered reasonably quickly. That quibble aside, we enjoyed a very peaceful night and the usual noisy airport intrusions were completely absent; we didn't hear any aircraft taking off, nor doors slamming or people making their way up & down the corridors! Amazing sound-proofing! As for the continental breakfast - excellent! We'll certainly use this hotel again."

We checked in at 11pm after a fraught and worrying time trying to arrange alternative flights so stress levels were a bit high. The 2 lovely girls on reception were amazing. They could not do enough for us and should be recognised by this hotel for their outstanding service! Unfortunately We cannot remember their names but they were both blonde if that helps and we stayed on the night of the 7th August. The one girl had finished her shift but stayed on until she was sure that we had rooms for the night. We had a problem with one of our cards and she remained calm and professional while we sortedcsomething else out. With 3 children in tow this was invaluable. The rooms were super and the breakfast was very nice. Would definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone. Thanks again 😊"

786,345grahaml,2018-08-31,4.0,"A good airport hotel - excellent breakfast Having a late night flight arriving in Bristol and an early morning flight leaving 72 hours later, the Hampton seemed a good choice. Being so close to the airport terminal, I feared for the noise and when I was given a room overlooking the access road and the planes this just enhanced my concern. In fact, the room was very quiet. The only disturbance was a noisy A/C thermostat which kept making a loud click as it kicked in and out. The room wasn't enormous but was perfectly adequate for a short stay and the bathroom (shower only) was well appointed. The mattress (always a plus point in Hilton Hotels in my experience) was VERY firm but comfortable. Unfortunately, the down duvet was too hot for my liking even with the AC turned down to a minimum and the hotel doesn't carry blankets (why oh why do hotels around the world do this????). Breakfast was excellent for a hotel of this type - a good selection of hot and cold dishes and a good choice of fruit and cereals, and I was pleased to be able to have a good breakfast at 05:30 before I took my flight. All the major car rental companies are within walking distance so I hired my car the morning after I arrived, thereby saving one day's rental. The hotel staff was welcoming and efficient. I wouldn't want to spend a holiday there, but for a couple of nights between flights, this was a good choice."
787,667gavinj,2018-09-30,3.0,Wet room issue  Seriously ... have you ever heard of a slope.   Morning showers were so uncomfortable - the bathroom became flooded and a slip hazard. I appreciate that we were put in a room that was specifically for a disabled person . Booked plenty of time in advance seriously disappointed and whilst the bed was comfy and room quite nice - this issue has just literally set me off to my holiday on a bad note. Paid 89 pounds and I’m packing wet items of clothing into my case. Not good Hilton

The room was very comfy and had all the amenities we needed.  Unfortunately we were woken by an alarm in our room at midnight and a staff member had to come and turn off the aircon for it to stop, which woke our daughter and meant we could not use the aircon so it was very hot.  We had to get up at 3.45am for a flight so did not sleep much.  However, i complained at the desk in the morning and our full stay price was refunded within a couple of days and we were credited some Hilton points by way of an apology.

Unfortunately issues occur, and on the basis of the way that Hilton dealt with our issue i would absolutely recommend them for their excellent customer service.  I imagine without the alarm/aircon issue our stay would have been perfect and we would definitely stay there again."

Evening bar menu a bit limited but the burgers were good.  Fantastic cappuchino coffee - best ever. Very happy to recommend this hotel."
796,lyndawelly45,2018-08-31,4.0,"very convenient for the airport but not cheap ! I stayed one night before getting my flight the next day, the location is brilliant just a short walk through the car park and your at the terminal. my room was clean and comfortable, wifi worked well. I had a snack in the bar of a jacket potato which was awful blackened skin just warm and the Tuna mayonnaise was sloppy and was nearly all Mayo, so I wasn't really impressed the bar area was very busy with lots of families and a long wait for food so I didn't bother sending it back as I was on my own and didn't want to wait for another meal. breakfast was good nothing fancy just typical buffet breakfast, all in all I found it quite expensive at £107 for one person for one night, but only alternative is to get transport into Bristol."
797,Paganbilly,2018-08-31,2.0,"Poor food reflects badly on very comfortable hotel We stayed overnight due to an early morning flight. The hotel is very clean and comfortable and the staff are very helpful. However the food is poor and reflects badly on the hotel as a whole. I was able to talk to the manager about my experience but am not sure if this will make a difference. On looking at other reviews I see my complaints are similar to previous guests. Please do something about the quality of the food as it spoils a good hotel experience

798,Travelling_Footy_Fan,2018-06-30,4.0,"Turned into a positive experience  After a less than satisfactory booking process and stay, the hotel completely turned around our experience to make it a place we would recommend and hopefully return. We stayed before departing on holiday in a good sized and clean room. Hotel is within walking distance to terminal. Only negatives I can say now would be the car parking situation and the staff still need to be trained with it being a new hotel"
799,Kinellar223344,2018-08-31,4.0,"An excellent and conveniently sited hotel The bedroom was clean, very comfortable and well appointed. The entire hotel was tastefully decorated in a pleasing palate of colours. While the restaurant area was basic it was perfectly adequate for an airport hotel where most people are staying only one night. The dinner menu was somewhat curtailed the evening we stayed due to a technical problem with the kitchen equipment."

Ideal locations less then 5min walk to airport, Room was clean breakfast was amazing. Friendly staff. We arrived just after midnight as our flight to Bristol was delayed and we had a slight problem with payment as I'd left the cash at home and had changed the rest of my cash to euros our card wouldn't work in the card reader but my partner walked back to the airport to draw cash out the guy on reception checked me in so I could get to the room while waiting for my partner to return with payment he told us we could settle on checkout but I'm a worrier and like to pay before."
803,whatthetigerate,2018-08-31,3.0,"Decent airport overnight stop Stayed one night before an early flight, two adults and a toddler. Hotel is ideally situated on the airport site, a couple of minutes walk to the terminal.

Reasonable size room, clean and in a good state of repair. Main bed comfy, sofa bed ok.

Gym is basic but clean.

Restaurant let’s the hotel down a little. Stylishly decorated but menu very basic, mainly sandwiches and jacket potatoes, would have preferred something more substantial after a day travelling. That said, service was polite and quick. Jacket potatoes with tuna mayo were ok but this menu is more of a cafe menu than a hotel one. Bar again looks good but no fruit juice or other children’s drinks. Very confused staff when we asked for some milk for our son.

We would stay here again before a flight but would eat somewhere else."

805,marcinmL9232ZT,2018-08-31,1.0,"Please, Please AVOID if traveling for business Business trip from hell!!!
Checked in on Wednesday to stay for 7 nights during recent business trip. First impression clean room but very cold and noisy, air conditioning by default turned to minimum. Both air-con and fan in the bathroom extremely noisy. I was tired after trip, needed some rest, so decided to call for assistance with air-con and fan setup. Picked up the room phone to call service...no signal. Oh well, not a good start. The worst is yet to come. On Friday I left to London for business, leaving note on the door ""do not disturb"". I left some of my personal belongings and work business related documents in the room. Upon arrival on Saturday i could not re-enter my room. When spoke to staff, I was told that I was checked out by mistake, my belongings were removed from the room and no one knew what happened to it. Shocking!!!. 
From Saturday until the day of my departure no one made any proactive attempt to contact me, I needed to ask every day for updates with very little effect. 
The case was handled now to the plice to investigate. Waste of time, waste of money, stressful and disappointing treatment.
The worst hotel I have ever visited. Oh, almost forgot, if you drive there, you will have to pay £30.00 for overnight parking on top of your room price.

Really bad

Avoid and warn others"
806,markgro,2018-08-31,1.0,"Not the best Stayed here the night before our hols checked in to be informed i would need to pay £16 to use the car park over night,a great start to our hols,we have stayed in many airport hotels before flying and this was a first to be charged to use tje car park wherelse are you going to park? So the room was clean but the beds were very uncomfortable and the pillows were a waste of time,no room service so had to eat in the bar area there was a very limited menu and nothing to keep the kids occupied,breakfast was the usual buffet not to bad but we had prebooked to stay on our return from our hols just to finish it off but the parking charge left a sour taste and so ive cancelled,the hotel say they will still charge but good luck to them with that as ive cancelled the card.We wouldnt stay again we will stick to other airports that dont rip you off once your there"
807,bauloprincess,2018-08-31,5.0,"Airport hotel at its best.  We stayed here the night before an early morning flight. The price was very reasonable and included a complementary breakfast. We left early so only had the continental option. This was of a good standard and perfect for what we required. 
The room was very clean and spacious. Lovely bathroom with a great shower. 
Very comfortable bed. Hotel was very quiet and no aircraft noise heard at all. It’s very convenient for the terminal. We will definitely stay here again if we have an early morning flight."
808,RazorsMahd,2018-08-31,4.0,"Perfect and convenient location  Group of 11 adults and 3 small children stayed overnight at the hotel. The hotel was perfect, very clean. Location is very easy to find. 

Reception was great. We didn't eat an evening meal at the hotel but the bar was empty on our return so no problems with drinks. 

The breakfast was better than expected and not busy. Check out was very quick.

My only gripe would be that you have to pay 50% of the fee for parking at the hotel.

All in all I would happily stay again."
809,KernowSteve,2018-07-31,4.0,"Great overnight stay and very convenient location. Stayed in a twin room for a night prior to our early morning flight. The room was located at the rear of the hotel which we were able to select via the app. 
The hotel was clean, tidy and quiet for an airport hotel.
We didn't have any issues with our room, and departed early am without breakfast.
We definitely will use this hotel again as its so close to the terminal and we had a great service from staff on reception."
810,baron_robbo,2018-08-31,3.0,"Just don't go to the bar Great little hotel in regards to its proximity and general cleanliness/modernness.

Enjoyed using the gym, the kind staff and the decent breakfast. Dinner options are very limited - and not great - but I can take that. 

Most of my chagrin lies in the staffing of the bar (somewhere I frequented a few times due to a cancelled flight...your honor). Generally the staff seem more concerned with doing trivial tasks rather than serving the ever growing number of people waiting to order food or drink. The absolute highlight was, as a huge line of people formed, the barman saying to his colleague (herself a trainee, new to the job and the only other staff member behind the bar) 'I'm taking my break' and proceeding to swan past the huge line at about 730pm. Genuinely never seen such flagrant disregard for customer service in my life. Left a really bad taste in my mouth."
811,AlfieW_12,2018-08-31,3.0,"My goodness 🙄 Lovely hotel, super location great room although on the small side. Reception were great.. 
Menu terrible ... what a terrible small choice. Queue like McDonald’s at least 12people waiting... Service appalling Louie was great polite and spoke. One of the waitresses just plonked the food down and walked away without saying a thing. The bar staff were rude no please no thank you  a real shame as they all appeared to lack clear managerial guidance and guest service experience."
812,nickamywatson,2018-07-31,5.0,"Great airport hotel We stayed here before a morning flight, and the whole experience was a great way to start a holiday, situated right next to the long stay car park, which is the best place to park, and a few minutes walk from the terminal. Check in was efficient in no time we were checked in. we had one double and one twin room, both rooms were clean and well appointed with coffee making facilities. The bathroom was well lit with a lovely shower. The whole room had a spacious feel, the hotel was really quiet not like other airport hotels we have stayed in. The bar area is large and the food and drink served was first class and reasonably priced, the service was efficient and friendly just what we wanted for a relaxing start to our holiday. Breakfast was included and was available in a room off the bar area, it's a help yourself buffet style with cooked foods and cereals which means there is no waiting if your in a hurry. Check out was quick and we were on our way in no time and in the terminal in 5 mins. Would recommend this hotel unreservedly."
813,343clairem,2018-08-31,4.0,"great airport hotel Booked the hotel  as we had an early flight next morning. 
Reception area nice bright, check in was quick.
Room was lovely. Very modern, nice king size bed, dressing table and arm chair. Great walk in shower. Flat screen TV. There was tea coffee in the room. Also shower gel.
Food was ordered at the bar, although there was a queue, orders were taken quickly and food arrived within 15 minutes.
We slept well, the room is well soundproofed.
We did not have breakfast as only continental was available before 6 am.
It is a short walk to the terminal.   
My only criticism is, as I am coeliac, the only food that I could eat from the menu, was jacket potato or perhaps nachos.
Would defiantly stay here again."
814,3Pointers,2018-07-31,4.0,"Excellent airport based hotel Located only minutes from the airport terminal, the hotel is spacious and easy to access (though if you are pushing a trolley, you will have to walk further using ramps, not steps in the open - if it is raining, you will get damp). Staff at reception were friendly, quick and efficient. The long counter has check-in at one end with the bar at the other - the lobby acts as lounge, bar and restaurant and there are dividers to give some privacy. Meal orders are given at the bar end. There is even a small area in the front of the bar counter that sells snacks and bottled drinks. 
The hotel has two lifts which were clean and quick. The hotel corridors were colourful and quiet. Rooms are mostly uniform size and well insulated - no aircraft noise, in fact no sounds from anywhere permeated the room. Very comfortable king sized bed, arm chair with separate leg rest, writing desk with chair, remote tv, tea and coffee making up the main room, the ensuite bathroom had a walk-in shower but was so designed that there is no door or curtain. The curved side glass keeps water off the bathroom floor! Well lit and again very clean. Plenty of soap, shampoo and conditioner.
Breakfast was included and is all self service, available in a purpose built room off the lobby. Cleverly designed to avoid queuing, there was a very good variety of hot and cold foods, juices and hot drinks. Although it was busy, there was no waiting for people to move on. 
Check out was a breeze. The hotel has a big car park - the first hour is free, and with car rental companies right next door, it was simple to pick up a vehicle, and depart the airport. 
An excellent facility"
815,Scooteraande,2018-08-31,4.0,Balloon festival  Stayed in this hotel for two nights while visiting Bristol for the balloon 🎈 festival - first of all hidden car park charges - however hotel - nice big spacious reception area with polite and helpful staff - we had two rooms they were very accommodating placed us close together even though one was a family room. Rooms clean ample size nice big comfy beds tea and coffee iron ironing board and hairdryer - nice spacious bathroom /no bath but large lovely shower - nice size tv - air conditioning good as window did not open on third floor - literally right next to airport no noise bothered us at all good sound proofing - breakfast was beautiful good variety served at good times by this I mean you can go to some hotels and they serve breakfast like 7-9 which is not good breakfast here was from about 6-10.30 lots of choice. Ample lifts to upper floors. Only issue we had was that a member of housekeeping let themselves into one of our rooms around 23.30 when our family was sleeping did not knock first as they knew someone was in there - then again in the morning the cleaners again walked in without knocking - when they should never have been in - this was highlighted to the manager becky who was very apologetic and provided us with ample compensation and assured us that the housekeeping manager is dealing with the situation for which we thanked her. Overall a very good stay would recommend.
816,Teddycame2,2018-08-31,3.0,Hidden parking charges be warned  We booked this room last minute so paid a reasonable amount. Nothing prepared us for also having to pay overnight parking in the car park outside the hotel of £16.50. Having double checked on the website there is no mention of this additional charge. We also booked a family room to find it wasn’t made up on arrival so we had to swap rooms as housekeeping weren’t available to make up a bed. Disappointing.
817,BigRay54,2018-08-31,2.0,"This is a joke as an on airport hotel The hotel is nice.
Rooms are typical of most on airport hotels, well appointed and very clean with a super comfy bed.
Breakfast is very good.
Staff are nice.
Great value.
What I fail to understand is why it was built here in a hole two levels below the terminal at the far end of the airport property.
We both have walking difficulties and it IS NOT a two minute walk nor is it easy - a Fitbit said it was 3250 steps from terminal to hotel if you use the road route.
Four heavy bags, after midnight, raining — it’s a miserable walk with a trolly.
The signage is rubbish in the dark.
Why this wasn’t built opposite the terminal with a walkway between the two is a mystery - see the Gatwick example - pure ease.
This is typical of Bristol airport - NON USER FRIENDLY.
The management should be made to make the walk at midnight with four heavy bags, in the rain and then see what they say.
Pathetic position for an on airport hotel / shame because once you get there it’s nice.
Just another reason to avoid this pathetic excuse for an airport when coming to the UK - fly Birmingham and travel Sth West by car or train."
818,af935,2018-08-31,5.0,"Fantastic  We stayed here last night before flying out early this morning.

Nice breakfast area, dining space and bar. Meeting room is comfortable, spacious and has everything you need. The work-space just outside in the lobby near the reception desk is fantastic and a nice extra for the hotel. Easy access to the rooms and the rooms are great, everything you need and so clean & tidy for what is normally a short-stay at an airport hotel.

821,sarahwY5274QM,2018-08-31,4.0,"So convenient  My husband and I stayed here after getting in late from Tenerife. I normally don't stay in hotels like this, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It was very clean, the staff was friendly, and it was literally across the street from the baggage claim. You cannot get anymore convenient than this! I was very wary to stay here because of how many people must stay here for the same reason we did, convenience. However, it exceeded my expectations. It doesn't look like tons of people stay here each night because of how clean it was. We are staying here again in September, to make an early flight to Italy. I would totally recommend it!"

Nice room and hotel. Just avoid getting food here. 

It took 1 hour 15 minutes to get a jacket potato and risotto. 

Other guests were also waiting over an hour. 

Customer service was appalling. No apology and staff blamed the delay on a large order (table of 11).

The hotel rooms were fantastic and the hotel is within walking distance of the airport. 
They serve food 24 hours per day which is great. BUT the tables were sticky and not properly cleaned when we went for dinner in the evening and again when we went for breakfast in the morning. We suggest that the many waiters and waitresses who bring food to guests and are clearing the tables should have cleaning clothes and at least wipe clean the tables for the next guests."

All in all a great stay and one I think I will be repeating in the near future. Oh and the gyms pretty good too for an airport hotel!"
828,DevonCustomer,2018-07-31,2.0,"Nice place restaurant service a disaster Stayed late July on the way to holiday. Great location - a few minutes stroll from airport terminal building, free parking while you drop off your bags. Nice new hotel design. 
Large seating area also used for meals etc. 
Bedroom modern and clean, smart fitness centre.

Offers simple food menu. We ordered at the same time as friends who we were sat with - nothing complicated; jacket spud and burgers. We were given a number to display on our table.  Food was being delivered by vacant looking lads who carried one plate at a time (!)
After a while our friends food came. 
As ours did not appear I ask one of the waiters, who said ‘oh ye I’ve seen some with your number in but didn’t know where you were sitting’. After another wait the jacket spud arrived - like warm but my daughter decided it was better to have something !  Still no food for the rest of us so I asked again. This time he said our food has gone so is being cooked again.  After a long wait it arrived.
RUBBISH SERVICE. Surely when the food is ready you bring it out and walk through the restaurant calling ‘order no. 30’. It’s not rocket science. 
Bar staff weren’t on top of their game either. 
We walked to M&S to get dessert and returned to seats to eat them. 
We were up too early for cooked breakfast - continental breakfast was good, plenty of choice."
829,Jake_Tommasi,2018-07-31,3.0,Decent night stay before early flights  Just what you need before early flights the next day. Seamless check in and out. Good late night and early morning breakfast from 4 am and comfortable enough rooms for the night.

The breakfast was more than adequate and catered extremely well for the cosmopolitan range of guests.

832,KathyF136,2018-07-31,1.0,"AWFUL!!! I have to start by saying that I really dislike writing bad reviews but feel I must write this one to make others aware. 
After flying home from our holiday, my daughter had booked a room at this hotel 2weeks prior to our one night stay. We arrived at 03.45a.m, all four of us, my daughter, her 2 children, 15months and 8years old, and myself. We checked in, no problem went to our room, and as we let ourselves in the smell hit us, it was awful. I went into the bathroom and although the shower and wash basin looked clean the toilet certainly wasn't! The lid was up and had been left  In flushed!!! It was disgusting. Not only the smell but the state of the toilet. We were so tired so decided we wouldn't raise the problem until morning! 4hours later we were getting showered to go down stairs for breakfast. No problems there. 
On checkout the duty manager asked if our stay was ok? We told him what we had found when we arrived just a few hours before, His reply was il have to check with the housekeeper who cleaned it but it could've been a back up problem where it won't flush!!! And then proceeded to ask where we had been on holiday and did we enjoy it! There was no apology just an excuse that the toilet may have been backed up! Really??? I asked to see the manager, he said he was the duty manager so I asked what will happen once he's asked the housekeeper, he said he would email us to let us know!! 
Almost a month later we have had no email of explanation or apology which really isn't good enough. We paid a lot of money for literally 4hours in a room and not even an explanation can be made! 
We are so disappointed that I feel writing a review is our only option."

Room very clean, comfortable and a good size. Black our curtains and soundproofed so wasn't affected by airplane noise. Friendly reception staff. I didn’t use the restaurant for evening meal but thought the early morning continental breakfast was pretty good (served from 4am).

There was lots of parking, the check in was easy and the staff very friendly. The rooms were clean, spacious and well appointed. There was a huge variety for breakfast, and the layout was really good. My only comment would be that the quality of the cooked items wasn’t great. Check out was easy, we were disappointed to have to pay £17.50 for the parking having paid for two rooms! We would definitely stay again if flying from Bristol."
837,anthonyj26,2018-07-31,3.0,"VERY DISSAPPOINTED Having returned in the early hours we booked in and went to our room.   The bed wasn't as comfy as a Premier Inn … in fact we both had a bad night's sleep.   We got up in the morning only to find that the shower was cold!   Reluctantly we used it as we had a long journey to take.   At Reception we told them about this issue and left if with them whilst we went for breakfast to decide what they could do.   Breakfast was a let down, nothing flows in this self service section .. it's a bit like a cross roads!   We had our full English which wasn't that hot.   I got my coffee and husband got his.   He went back for another slice of toast leaving his full coffee there,  I went up for another coffee.  On his return his plate had gone with his butter and marmalade!   The Staff on duty had seen us sat at the table so they should have paid more attention to see if we were in the self service area.   Back to Reception to see what they could do regarding our room which we had paid full price for.   At first the comment was ""It's been resolved now and you can go back if you wish""!!!   No, we have a long way to go.   Eventually after making comments about paying for a service which we haven't received the on Duty Manager gave us a partial refund.    All in all a very poor stay at the Hampton in Bristol.   Not somewhere we would want to stay again.   I know things can go wrong but it is the way in which you deal with them that make the customer return … It was a very slow response from the Duty Manager and only after it had been suggested by myself was the reduction given.   You should have been offering to refund without my prompting you."

840,John_atte_Kiln,2018-07-31,4.0,"Very good and unexpectedly inexpensive This very new hotel has been built right on Bristol airport, as close as you could get. It's extremely convenient if you have a very early flight and fulfills a real need.  As you might expect from Hilton, it's very well thought out by people who know what they're doing. The staff are very professional.  Our room was very good, it had everything you might need for a short stay.  It's designed for people with an early flight out.  For example they serve breakfasts from from 4am (continental, adequate) and hot meals from 6pm.  We took a deal for one night including breakfast and with one week's parking for the car at Bristol airport's silver car park (in itself recent extensively refurbished and providing a far better service than  previously).  I can't remember exactly, but I think we paid about £120 for all that (2 people, 2 breakfasts).  The hotel has a large holding car park which you can use as you book in and you have 1 hour free to settle in.  The hotel prices for meals etc were unexpectedly inexpensive, bearing in mind it's the Hilton.  Small dishes £5ish, larger meals £12ish, that sort of range.  Very acceptable quality.  A pint of beer was around £3.50;  they really aren't taking advantage of their prime location at the moment.  It's a very easy walk to the departure lounge in the morning.  I recommend this hotel if you're taking an early flight out of Bristol;  we'll certainly use them again."
841,jimmyg931,2018-07-31,5.0,Very nice Very nice hotel. Good rooms. Good service. Good prices. Rooms were very comfy. Walking distance from the terminal. As its a new hotel everything is very good. Would definitely recommend to family and friends
842,gingeblakes,2018-07-31,4.0,"10/10 for convenience and quality Needed a hotel near the airport to catch an early morning flight. We didn’t want the hassle of moving the car in the morning so plumped for the only hotel on the site of the airport.

The hotel is immaculately clean and modern. Price (booked a week before the stay) was really good value £80 especially as it included breakfast (which opens at 4am) for me and my husband.

Breakfast set up was a little confusing but it wouldn’t put me off. Definitely the most convenient option for an early flight - terminal is less than a 5 minute walk.

Only other negative - room above us were very noisy. Not sure if they were particularly heavy footed or if floors are thin. It did disturb us a couple of times."
843,34lynb,2017-12-31,5.0,Sleep before you fly. Hotel is opposite departures/arrivals so just perfect. Early flights receive a buffet breakfast but after 6 ish there is a full hot version available. Good choice of meals for lunch and evening and the bar and seating area is nice
844,clairebbz91,2018-07-31,4.0,Great stay noisy air con Great hotel very comfortable and friendly helpful staff. Food also good evening meals and breakfast great choice to choose from. Only downside is the air con or something in the roof in every room I’ve been in which is 3 making a banging and clanking noise which wakes you up and scares the hell out of you every hour through the night. Also sounds like water is running through the toilet and never stops either. Not great when your trying to sleep and have work the next day. Apart from this great hotel.
845,katief218,2018-06-30,3.0,"Basic  Three of us stayed at this hotel before an early morning flight.

We arrived in time to have our evening meal. The restaurant felt more like a canteen where you find somewhere to sit and then go to the bar to order.  There was a long queue when we were there.  The food was ok but nothing special. 

The rooms are clean and serve their purpose.  It has everything you need eg tea and coffee etc.

Breakfast was continental and there was a good selection of food but we didn’t actually have anything as 4am was a bit early. 

The hotel is in a good location for the airport terminal and I would probably stay there again if I had an early flight purely for the convenience."
846,_ksifostratoudaki,2018-07-31,3.0,"Lovely hotel, shame about the noisy plumbing! The hotel was ideal for Bristol Airport.  The room was spacious and clean, with a nice bathroom. Unfortunately, there was a noise coming from just above the entrance to the room, loud enough to wake me several times.  It wasn't the air-con as I had switched it off in the hope of it helping with the noise. I presume it was a boiler or some kind of plumbing."
847,nickpC3902TK,2018-06-30,3.0,"Handy for the airport but eat before you arrive Rooms do the job, the internet works and it si good to be able to get a coffee and a quick bite before an early start over to the airport. However the evening food is poor, overpriced and with a long wait. Stay at the hotel but eat before you arrive"
848,felixthepurplecat,2018-05-31,3.0,"Very convenient for an early flight. Overall this hotel was clean and quite satisfactory and the location is excellent if wanting to be close to the airport.  The early breakfast was useful for us as we had a morning flight. 
However we found the reception staff aloof and not inclined to be helpful.  The screen on the shower area was so small that most of the bathroom was sprayed by the shower, which was a little annoying.
It is an easy distance to the airport, however the covered section is only part of the way, and due to the heavy rain at the time we needed to cross over, we got quite wet. There needs to be some solution for this."
849,icylight,2018-06-30,3.0,"Hilton by name not by nature If you stay here, don't order food, you may get it by midnight, if your lucky. Cannot handle anymore than 30 people asking for food...The duty manager had to go in the kitchen to help out, as he couldn't stand the abuse he was getting and the poor girls were left to try and sort it all out. We have wrote to hilton, on the night it happened. All they could say is glad you got a refund.  By the look of things people travelling after us had the same experience. So clearly they don't want return business.We went to the airport to get marks and Spencer food and brought it back and ate in the bar. We got our refund for the none food service we asked for. The room was ok and check in was swift in and out, that's much as I can say about it.  Hilton if you cannot cope, get vending machines in...As least people will get food they have paid for."
850,afairdeal2018,2018-06-30,1.0,"Stayed for overnight- never again! Arrived late pm on 23 rd June for flight at 6 am the next morning. I and two complete German coach loads arrived at the same time with very few reception staff. The plan for an evening meal is to order at the bar- this took hours as the coach travellers were first and there were only two young girls working very hard, I suggested the manager removed his jacket and go and help!! I also enquire whether the coach travellers were expected and if so why were no extra staff called in. The food was foul but cost Hilton prices and all eaten in the bar under a tv showing a German World Cup match. No breakfast was available for my early flight and the short taxi ride to help a 76 year old woman get to the airport was £18- I carried my suitcase in darkness at 4 am. Never ever again will I pay Hilton prices for this level of service. Judith Davies"
851,633adelad,2018-07-31,5.0,"One night stay A quick one nighter after having a very delayed flight and arriving at 11:30 pm. The staff were friendly snd the hotel was clean and smart. The hotel is litterally a 2 min walk from the arrivals at the airport and ever so convenient!!! The room was spacious clean and had all the necessities one would need. The breakfast was lovely with vegan choices and hot dishes, it is a self serve type buffet. If i ever needed to come back i would definetely stay here. Highly recommend!!!"
852,Webelly,2018-06-30,4.0,"Easy Stayed prior to early flight. Everything was fabulous. Prices for food and drink reasonable considering there is no competition All staff we met were very friendly and polite. They appeared happy. Room small but clean and comfortable.
Would recommend highly."
853,Nathcuk,2018-06-30,5.0,"Stress free  What a cracking hotel. Situated 5 mins walk from the terminal, it provided a stress free start to our holiday. 

You get an hour free parking to drop bags etc off, simply give your ticket to the receptionist and they'll sort it for you. Once checked it, get your luggage up to your room. After a few minutes drive to the silver zone parking area, just drop your car keys off at the desk and they will give you a card to take with you which you present on your return. The bus will then pick you and take you back to the terminal, where you can walk back down to the hotel. Very straight forward!

We ate in the hotel too. The food was fine and was more than enough to eat. The menu is a little limited, but there should be something for everyone. Children's menu's are a sip able on request.

We didn't eat breakfast, as we wanted to get another half an hour sleep. In any case, 4am is a little early to eat if I'm honest. We ate in the airport, and whilst a little expensive, there was an abundance of choice. Nothing much else to do anyway, so may as well eat!

When we next fly from Bristol we will be sure to stay at this hotel. Easy, stress free and good value"
854,Karen_Kingswinford,2018-07-31,5.0,"Impressed! Close to the terminal (5mins walk) and yet incredibly quiet. Nice modern, new, light and airy hotel with good sized bedrooms and a fabulous shower and bathroom. Comfortable large bed and good AC ensured a great night’s sleep.
Products in the bathroom were of a good standard too for hotel amenities.
Breakfast was very good. Completely self serve but such a wide choice available. Fresh fruits, porridge continental and full English all available. Staff are all pleasant and friendly, and a good ambience in the foyer area where a small bar serves reasonably priced drinks and there is a small tv area ( World Cup viewing for those who wanted it) 
Our only gripe is no fridge or chill cabinet in the room - but otherwise all round excellent! We will be back and happy to recommend."
855,maurice12345566,2018-06-30,3.0,Does the job Was there for two nights. Decent hotel. The highlight was their waffle machine for breakfast. You heard me right a waffle machine. A part from that I didn’t hear any planes pass by when sleeping but you could hear the people in the room above. For a quick stay it was worth while.
856,justhadtosay,2018-06-30,4.0,"Good airport hotel Stayed here for early flight.   Very happy with room, comfortable reasonably quiet for an airport hotel.  Good value for money.  We thought the bar/restaurant was good for the type of hotel and service friendly.   Have used before and would use again as it is next to the terminal, in a perfect location.  Breakfast is from 4am.   Only downside is that you can't park there for a week or two.     Also as you walk in you have to walk past the nicotine addict area through tobacco smoke - not nice right next to the main entrance, but otherwise v nice."
857,EmmasTravels,2018-06-30,4.0,Perfect Airport Location I booked the hotel because of its proximity to the airport. Having an early flight I stayed here. I was able to drop of a rental car at the airport drop off point and walk to the hotel. The room was comfortable if a little small . The AC  in the room was not very effective but I was unaware of any noise from the flights. Breakfast was available from 4am but my check in was before this time. I was able to walk from the hotel with two cases to check in for my flight. A perfect place to stay if you want to be close to the airport.
858,fransic,2018-06-30,5.0,"Good stopover hotel  We stayed one night before an early flight out .The hotel is right next to the airport. We parked checked in then you have an hour free to move your car , check in is1uick and easy ,the rooms are nice ,comfy beds and a fab shower .
We left at 4 30 so only had the continental breakfast which was fine .
The walk to terminal takes 5 mins and is all outside and up steps or via ramps. 
We didn't est at the hotel ,instead we drove to a harvester before leaving our car in silver zone parking .
Definitely recommend and definitely stay again."
859,fiftysomething100,2018-06-30,4.0,"An excellent choice for an early flight Like most, we had an early flight and this hotel was really good ~ much better than the one at Gatwick. Reception staff were welcoming, the room had plenty of space for luggage, there was a comfortable bed and arm chair and a good shower. The early morning call was bang on time. The bar/restaurant is spacious and the food was surprisingly good. We ate in the bar and it was reasonably priced and very good. The atmosphere was pleasant and not as souless as many airport hotels. Continental breakfast begins at 4 (cooked from 6), and it was all ready at that time ~ a reasonable range and far better than the one we had at the Gatwick Hilton by Hampton. If you ask for a box you can pack a breakfast to take into the terminal, if you prefer.
There is a hotel car park, which is free for the first hour so you can check in before moving the car to whichever car park you have booked. Hotel parking is more expensive than the long stay, so we moved our car ~ very easy walking distance to the car park. The only criticism is the walk from the hotel to the terminal. It is worth noting that this hotel is NOT attached to the terminal. Hilton have utilised the existing paths, so you have to pull your cases up a couple of long slopes; however, there is plenty of room for a more compact access alongside the steps. It was fine on a dry June morning, but I would have been less happy on a wet November day! It is something to bear in mind if you have mobility problems though. Halfway along the path is a stand of luggage trolleys, but you need a couple of pounds to unlock one. 
We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely use this hotel again, if we had an early flight from Bristol."
860,DavidRSymons,2018-06-30,3.0,"Good Location l, More attention to detail required  I stayed in the Hampton before catching an early flight out of Bristol airport. It was a mixed experience. 

Pros:

Helpful, friendly staff
Location - 5 min walk to airport
Comfortable bed
2 soft drinks and 2 chocolate bars for Hilton gold members

Cons:

I arrived just after 9pm and good service was in melt down. Lots of complaints of people waiting over an hour for food. Eat before you arrive. 
Shower was hot or cold and difficult to get to a comfortable temperature 
Shower drain blocked

On balance I would stay here again. It’s just too convenient! However they need to fix the food situation and would benefit from a little more attention to detail. 

My tip would be to book parking online with Bristol airport in the multi-storey. It’s a 2 minute walk and better value than the hotel."
861,jhooker6,2018-06-30,1.0,Rooms great but not if you want to eat!ur The rooms were clean and bright but don’t do there if you plan to eat. Even when it wasn’t busy we waitied an hour and a half for our food! They gave us a refund but that wasn’t really the point they had already ruined the first day of our vacation!
862,simws,2018-06-30,3.0,"Average hotel but so convenient Flying out from Bristol airport early doors makes this hotel perfect being minutes from the terminal but there is a lot of room for improvement. 
The evening food menu is very limited for choice and there is a big shortage of staff on the bar which becomes a bit confused as it kind of falls into reception, I don't think the open plan design of it works really.
Staff this visit were all really friendly, we ended up ringing reception to ask for a change of room and the air con/extract unit in the bathroom was so noisy and were told that they have many complaints of the same problem, seems the hotel needs some work to fix this, our new room didn't have the loud noise but the air con didn't work properly so it was a warm night and it wap too late to change room again.
Breakfast was pretty decent tho, overall an average stay and we would probably stay here again but the location is the best thing this hotel has going for it."
863,Sumz8,2018-06-30,5.0,"Most convenient  My girlfriend and I stayed here the day before we flew to Kraków. Just a stones throw from the airport and our coach stop from Plymouth! 
Superb hotel. Lovely spacious clean room. Quality bathroom. Comfy beds. Had a great nights sleep before getting up at 4am. Breakfast (continental only until 6am) was really nice. A great start to the day. Filled me up for my flight! 
Food the night before was fine. Nothing overly exciting but nice enough. Was convenient to eat in the hotel and get an early night. 
A very pleasant stay and will use every time we fly from Bristol including our next trip to Spain in September."
864,HelenW2376,2018-06-30,1.0,"Horrible service! Had meal before flight, placed order at bar. Had to wait ages for meal was surprised as it was empty. When meal turned up, the meal was so small!

Wouldn't eat there Again or recommend anyone else to !!"
865,GailN562804,2018-06-30,4.0,"Great but noisy air con Like many reviewers, this is a great convenient addition to Bristol airport but the noise from the air con (even when it’s turned off!) is unacceptable for a new hotel. With a 6.00am flight I really didn’t appreciate being woken by clanking every 30 minutes or so. Please get it sorted management. I have stayed a number of times since the hotel has opened and it hasn’t been addressed."
866,pib48,2018-05-31,5.0,"Affordable Quality Stayed for one Sunday night before flight to Barcelona. Paid £69 for great room, including breakfast.. I considered it a bargain price and it would have been the same if double occupancy.
The bed was large and very very comfortable, as were the 4 beautiful pillows.
Spotlessly clean, great bathroom with powerful shower and the room had tea making facilities, a iron and ironing board was even included. 
Concised bar menu for evening meal, and large selection of hot and cold buffet breakfast food. 
Friendly effience staff throughout, and easy check-in 
WiFi excellent 
A wonderful start to the holiday. 
Well done Hilton at Bristol Airport!"
867,ShirleyThomas,2018-06-30,5.0,"Excellent A late flight back meant we didn’t fancy driving the 2+ hours home. Hotel was great, a quick walk from airport, easy check in, comfortable room. Lovely breakfast the next morning, couldn’t wish for better"
868,Maturity,2018-06-30,2.0,Ideal place to stay before boarding a flight from the airport IT IS NOT POOR BUT I CANNOT GET PAST THE RATING it is good We stayed here thank heavens as the traffic was shocking on the way to the airport and it meant it was stress-free staying at the hotel. We had breakfast and wheeled our luggage on a trolley through to the terminal. Bit of a steep walk way be warned! The bed and the pillows were extremely comfy and there was a good shower BUT the floor in the shower was extremely slippery. They should do something about it. Be awful to break a leg before a flight.
869,Misog,2018-06-30,5.0,"2nd stay! Another fantastic experience  This was our 2nd stay at the hotel. On this occasion, it was after a late night flight into Bristol. 
Reception - extremely efficient and quick check in by friendly staff (we were in our room within minutes)
Room - lovely size, immaculately clean with everything you need comfortable beds, quality bedding, tea/coffee, shower gels, shampoo, body lotion, etc plus iron and ironing board. Rooms are so quiet, which is brilliant given the close proximity to the airport plus the number of travellers.
Food - we only had breakfast this time, which was again very good. It was hot, plentiful, and varied. 
Staff - all very friendly, efficient and helpful. Keith in the breakfast room today, was very friendly, helpful and kind. 

Excellent hotel, in prime location. Looking forward to our next stay in autumn"

871,49carolynb,2018-06-30,2.0,"Oh dear..never again We stayed here for one night on the first night that England were playing in the World Cup. Clearly the chef decided to hang up his apron and watch the match because the service was diabolical.  The restaurant was like something out of an episode of the Hungarian chef in the Muppet's. I have to say I'm appalled at some of the guests as well as the staff. We waited over an hour for our burger and chips with salad and coleslaw. We got the burger and chips but no coleslaw. It's not cheap..£10.95 I wonder how much we'd get back for the lack of coleslaw? We didn't bother finding out!
This is the third time we have stayed here and every time we come they have run out of wine. 
My advice...eat before you come here and bring your own wine, they can't cope and I don't believe they ever will. Absolutely atrocious. The rooms are clean on a plus...but forget everything else."
872,960NeilC960,2018-06-30,1.0,Awful Food Service Now been waiting over 90 minutes for curry of the day - absolutely ridiculous for a airport hotel !! One minute the excuse is “it is because it is so busy” next “the systems have been down” I think someone needs to get their story straight !!
873,spudder123,2018-06-30,1.0,"Alot for not alot We arrived after many hours in the car, we would of at least expected the bed to be made for our child. Nope! For £90 a night you have to make it yourself, and also miss out on breakfast if you have a early flight, they will not provide you anything, even if kids are in tow. Not alot of good things to mention here I'm afraid, lack of thought all round. 

The sofabed is also like rock, our 12 Year old had to sleep on it sofa style as it was so uncomfortable, not to mention the lack of bottom sheets!

We have  stayed four star in Barcelona and not had any issues at all. What a let down as we have no option when flying in and out of Bristol regularly, this hotel is the closest. We're sad to say, and regret to pay such a lot for not a lot at all."
874,Lindsey253,2018-06-30,5.0,"Perfect stay  Booked this hotel due to an early flight on Sunday morning, the hotel is very nice and convenient if you have an early flight!

875,Arrecife,2018-06-30,5.0,"Perfect Stay Before an Early Flight We stayed here the night before our early morning departure. We found the hotel to be perfect in every way for our needs.
As Hilton Hhonors members we could check in online via the app and when we arrived, Reception were expecting us and handed us our room key.
The room was very comfortable and adequate for our needs. As other reviewers have said, it is immediately across the road from the airport but in spite of this there is no noise at all. I agree the menu is limited for choice but we both had a meal and found this to be excellent - if a little on the expensive side. However, we were aware of this and as we were on holiday - indulged. The bed was comfortable and we managed to sleep before rising at 3.30 to cross to the airport for check in.
There is a covered walkway so far then you either go up steps to the terminal or you follow a path for step free access - either way it is no worse than crossing to the Hilton Gatwick from the South Terminal there.
All in all an excellent stay and a lovely start to our holiday. Would we stay again? - Most definitely. Would we recommend? - Certainly.  Try it - I'm sure you will not be disappointed as it is both comfortable and convenient for the airport terminal.
In closing I should add that the staff were excellent - all very friendly, professional and welcoming, which is another plus point in recommending the hotel and encouraging us to want to stay again."
876,RehanaL-Y,2018-06-30,5.0,"Great hotel Stayed here for one night last week. The hotel were helpful in giving us two rooms with sofa beds. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable.

877,Pammy0,2018-06-30,3.0,"Great location, comfortable room, terrible menu and food  Stayed here before an early morning flight, the hotel looks lovely, is very clean, the bed was very comfortable and the room amenities were good. Because of this I would stay again.

The bar however was both under stocked (4 things we asked for, they had run out of) and they were understaffed, they had 2 people on the bar to take food orders and serve drinks which meant the wait to be served was about 15 minutes.

Then we come to the menu and food, this has to be one of the worst choices of menu I have ever had in a hotel, very very basic menu and the food wasn’t much better, I had a burger and would have been better with a cheap frozen burger coked at home, no flavour and very little meat in it more bulking agent.   I would never eat in it again.

I would stay but make sure I ate prior to arrival."
878,HuwandFlea,2018-05-31,5.0,"Excellent This is the place to go if flying early from Bristol. Less than a hundred yards from terminal building, plenty of car parking space, and free internet service. Bar and restaurant excellent, though gets busy at certain times. Buffet breakfast is included, but our flight was so early, that we missed out. However, it is so close, that they suggested that we check in our luggage and then return to have breakfast. Could not be easier. After checking in to the hotel, and taking our luggage to the room, I took my car to the silver parking area, a mile from the airport, and used the shuttle bus to return to hotel. ON arriving back, took shuttle bus to silver parking area; car already driven close to departure point, and easy get away. NB the new road bypasses a great deal of the traffic and congestion of old. As stated before, this place is going to get very popular, so don’t tell everyone!"

880,eventhorizon,2018-06-30,1.0,"Wish I had stayed elsewhere Arriving back from Holiday at midnight after a 7 hour trip we thought it would be a good idea to book here for a decent nights sleep rather than drive through the night.  On arrival there was a queue of very tired looking travellers and as we observed the slowness of the 2 reception staff I and my wife were slowly losing the will to live ! In the night The fire alarm went off , 4 a.m for about a minute, then stopped for a short time and went off again  and again.  Eventually it stopped but a brilliant red flashing light carried on illuminating our room for some minutes.  Looking through the window I saw some guests in night clothing, pyjamas walking in and out of the hotel and the manager allowing people back in while he struggled at the fire panel by the exit door. I phoned reception to be told there was no fire and it was set off by accident and the duty manager was unavailable as he was with maintenance. We were unable to get back to sleep.  The next morning I asked what compensation we would get as I thought it extremely bad that the duty manager could not deactivate the alarm in one go instead of letting it carry on several times but I was met with a blank stare, a verbal sorry and told I was being aggressive!!! I was angry, not aggressive. I asked could I have free parking as a gesture ( £16 is the overnight fee !!!!! ) and was told this was not possible.  It was  like an episode of Fawlty towers and I was exhausted driving home that day.  I WILL NEVER stay at this place again."

883,cg26Bath,2018-06-30,4.0,"Good quality hotel opposite the airport I stayed here in June as I had an early flight the next day. The hotel is right opposite arrivals and departures, and is a two minute walk, albeit it up steps or a slope. You could however get a taxi if you had mobility issues. 

Check in was quick and efficient, and the rooms were very comfortable, quiet and well equipped.

There is a large bar area which serves drinks and snacks. However the system they have for serving is ridiculous and lets the hotel down. You order drinks and food from the same till and so all night from 6.30 - 8.30 there was a queue of around 6-8 people waiting to be served. People were understandingly getting frustrated and so were ordering several rounds at a time which just added to the problem. When I complained I was told they were unable to offer waiter service so we had to go to the bar. I would suggest that they have either separate tills for food, or else have somebody walking around taking food orders from people seated who will be adding the cost to their bill.
By 8.00 pm they had also run out of 2 of the 3 dishes I wanted.

Breakfast was included in the price and was good quality, hot and varied."
884,jadiepoos,2018-06-30,1.0,"Worst hotel I have ever stayed in First surprise was on arrival, I had not been informed that I would have to pay for parking £16.50 for the night on top of the hotel price of £85.00 given that we arrived at 3am that’s a lot of money for a few hours ‘sleep’ I use the term sleep loosely!  Then we got into the room and had been given a disabled room, with a wet room, having a two year old with me after a whole day of traveling it was not ideal as I couldn’t bath or wash her as I was scared she would slip over. Then there was trying to get to sleep with what sounded like a water boiler heating up continuously throughout the night, I had to call reception in the end because I had been trying to sleep for an hour and a half and every time I nearly got to sleep the noise would happen again. I was told it was the air conditioning and to turn it off, I did and it still continued throughout the night. I got a total of 3 hours sleep maximum which was great for a 3 and a half hour drive home. When I asked the receptionist in the morning what was going on I just about got a sorry no offer of any compensation or anything for a terrible night. Won’t be back and would 1000% not recommend."

Room comfortable, modern and clean. Lovely bathroom. One issue was the air conditioning- as mentioned by so many- ours was not even switched on but it was still banging and humming all night!
Continental breakfast was excellent. Will stay again but probably eat before we get to the airport!! Please sort out the air con????"
886,V2054PNsarab,2018-06-30,5.0,For the crack of dawn flight  I stayed at the hotel to make my pilgrimage back to work less painful. I was pleasantly surprised for an airport hotel. It’s steps away from the terminal. The bar food was great. The room really clean fresh and comfortable. Added bonus nice shampoo and shower gel.  Breakfast is laid out at 4 ready for the early morning flights.
887,554benp,2017-10-31,3.0,"Nice hotel with some flaws This hotel is very close to the Bristol Airport terminal - about a 3 minute walk under a sheltered walkway and up some steps. Very easy to check in and out, nice gym equipment.

Rooms are a good size with comfy beds - although I agree with other comments that the air conditioning system is very loud, which woke me up several times in the night. A fridge would've been useful in the room for bottles of water etc, although I'm aware they want you to pay restaurant prices. Hot breakfast was only available from 6am, which is a shame for travellers who leave before then.

While I understand the car parking prices are set by Bristol Airport, my partner was charged a few pounds solely to drop me off (under 20 minutes).

Would stay again if I can get for around £70 a night."
888,Tucker010780,2018-06-30,5.0,Great hotel Good hotel convinent for airport just a 3 min walk to the terminal breakfast great good selection iron and board in every room staff friendly easy to check in and out quiet rooms very good soundproofing will definitely use again
889,roaming11,2018-05-31,1.0,Horrible experience On checking in on the 28 May for one night before an early morning flight; we were disgusted at finding the toilet had not been cleaned and the previous user's remains still in the toilet bowl.  I complained at reception and was told the manager would be in touch with me. - I am still waiting!!  I was not offered another room.  I have sent several emails to Hamptons upon my return but even these have not produced a response.  Customer service definitely lacking at this hotel.
890,MrsMerlin,2018-06-30,2.0,"Disappointing Although this is a fairly new hotel we were disapointed - the room had an unpleasant smell which seemed to get stronger during the night. We also had cause to complain about the evening meal we had. I would have thought it difficult to mess up a Caesar salad, but they managed to do so, heavy, stodgy and very unpleasant. Although we were offered a desert as compensation we did not feel we wanted to eat anything more there!
All in all the hotel is what it is an overpriced airport stopover!"
891,RionaWorcestershire,2018-06-30,5.0,"Everything a hotel should be!  We stopped over for the night before our early morning flight at 6am the next day.

Keep up the good work Team Hampton By Hilton!"
892,Slapschtick,2018-05-31,5.0,"At long last a Hotel at Bristols Airport! ... and what a cracker it is.

Position, is everything and this Hotel is right there within walking distance of the Terminal... Everything was a-okay and then some.

Check-in was a breeze and very pleasant. 

Rooms were superb and very comfortable.

We enjoyed the little restaurant area for dinner and an early cooked breakfast.
 
I wouldn't hesitate to use this excellent hotel again if I had an early flight, it takes so much stress out of the whole thing with the added bonus of extra hours sleep.

The airport was easily accessible via an exit in the restaurant area where you go through a tunnel under the road. The two flights of stairs up to the road crossing were very manageable if not inconvenient but it is what it is, I was happy enough to do it.

My top tip, foam ear-plugs, I never travel without them and they guarantee a peaceful nights sleep ...

Thank you ... Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport."

It's a new hotel and everything was modern.
Bed was comfy and the toiletries very good.
Excellent breakfast.
And WiFi worked.
Very polite check-in and the lady that took our food order was very attentive. I forgot her name but her customer service was really amazing.

The only negative was no hot water at 420am, would have liked a shower to wake me up.

Definitely recommend"
894,aimzarose,2018-06-30,1.0,"Unprofessional Due to an error on our part, we had confusion with our room booking- the gentleman checking us in was very confused, but polite and as helpful as he possibly could’ve been. His colleague was incredibly rude, rolling her eyes in front of us- snapping at him when she didn’t understand and then noticeably speaking negatively to her other colleague about the original gentleman serving us and our situation. As an experienced assistant manager in this trade, I have never witnessed this level of unprofessional behaviour, and felt genuinely uncomfortable and embarrassed. From what we saw, the hotel is lovely, modern and clean- shame this staff member didn’t maintain the high standard set!"

Check in was easy and pleasant. Rooms are quiet, comfortable, clean and light.  It was an easy walk to the terminal.  Breakfast hot and cold buffet was included in the cost and was all we needed.  For convenience we had dinner at the hotel last night.  The menu is ok though a bit pricey for what is available.  However, dining and bar staff were pleasant and efficient.  The Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport is ideal for anyone staying overnight to catch a flight.  Happy to recommend."
896,979huckf,2017-08-31,4.0,"Perfect in all but one way This was the perfect location to begin and end our adventure in England. steps from the airport entrance and rental car locations, yet quiet with easy access to Bristol, Cornwall, Wales and all of southern England. In minutes, you are driving in the Cotswolds, eyeing the Roman baths or on the highway to London.The free breakfast is top-notch, a front-desk-located bar is open late and departure times for all flights are prominently displayed in the lobby and breakfast area the morning of your flight to keep you on your toes.
I had mobility issues, and a very kind front desk clerk assisted me in returning my rental car and getting me and my bags to the airport gate and handicapped service attendants. Really went out of his way to help me. Exceptional service!
DO NOT stay here with your rental car very long. The parking fees are very high. Pick up and drop off the vehicle before checking in/checking out."
897,JazzJP,2018-05-31,5.0,"Ideal pre flight hotel Well located right opposite the terminal, and next door to both the main front of terminal car park and the new multi-storey. Comfy modern hotel with good breakfast included. Would certainly use again.

Only down side is the walk to the terminal with cases as some of it is a bit up-hill and although not far in distance the footpath is not exactly direct. Ok in good weather not so good in wet or winter."
898,Nicander33,2018-05-31,4.0,"Great location We stayed here the night before we were due to fly to Spain as we had a very early flight.
The Hotel was very quiet, clean and comfortable (we walked over to the terminal in two minutes)  We had an drink and a burger in the bar which was okay.  One small detail was a bit annoying we asked at check in if we could have a breakfast tray made available as we had paid for bed and breakfast -we were told that would be fine even though the restaurant would not be open they would be able to do that, however when we arrived at 3.15am to have this breakfast we were told no sorry, not a great start to a long day."

Our flight was delayed so we were unable to check in until after midnight.
This did not affect the warm ,friendly welcome we received.
The check in was quick and easy and we were able to get to our room promptly.
The room was well appointed and very clean.
Breakfast is serve yourself with a good selection of hot and cold dishes on offer.
Check out was easy and it was only a few minutes walk to the car park.
A first rate stay"
902,LaGalouise,2018-05-31,5.0,"Great for Convenience I stayed here last week. I travel a lot from Bristol airport and find the Silver Parking Zone the best. yes you can park on site but it takes you longer to get to the terminal!!!! I had a package for stay and park. More expensive than some of the local B&B's but I loved the safety, comfort etc. Restaurant is very basic and hardly any choice though."
903,Cymru13,2018-05-31,3.0,"Ok airport hotel Stayed because of early flight following morning.

Couldn't park and stay, only available for a couple of days Max.

Rooms OK, all the necessaries, nothing you don't get in every other airport hotel.

Food, ok however a limited choice, and an absolute nightmare to order. Long wait at bar, in same que as anyone wanting to order just drinks.

Short walk to terminal, however not so short a walk from the parking on terminal."

Rooms are nice with good bathroom and tea and coffee facilities. Food is a bit basic, pizza or burgers I think but the burgers were good. It was a welcome surprise that the self service continental breakfast was up and running at that time in morning, the coffee and Danish pastries were lovely. Would stay again."
909,pa3ddg,2018-02-28,5.0,"I had an early flight, so I chose this hotel to stay before leaving England Instead of leaving extreme early from Bath, I took this hotel to stay before taking off. The advantage was that I could bring back the rental car at the evening, so no stress in teh morning. The restaurant is not a high flyer, but is was for sure no bad food. You order at the bar, you get a number to put on your table and they bring your food.
I had a excellent sleep in a very comfy room. In the morning a quick breakfast and walk a few minutes to the terminal.
This is foor sure a hotel to keep on my list."
910,88hays,2018-05-31,4.0,"Excellent airport hotel I have stayed in many airport hotels, and this is probably one of the best one. It's modern, clean and surprisingly quiet.

Apart from that, everything was very good. Will stay here again if I have to fly from Bristol early in the morning."

913,C3278ZUianl,2018-05-31,4.0,"The best (and only) airport hotel at Bristold Rapid check-in with all details correct from prebooking. Room of good quality, only thing lacking was a fridge. Bathroom very modern with excellent shower (no bath).

Food was just OK (and the only place to eat with airport lacking in landside facilities). It was typical pub fare at hotel prices. Wife had to send back pasta for more time in the micowave. Breakfast included in rate but only serving continental before 6 am - but this was a good spread.

Check-out rapid.

My only real criticism is that if you care carrying heavy cases the its a long walk up ramps to airport if you want to avaoid steps.

Good choice when coupled with Silver Zone parking."
914,keswickpenarth,2018-05-31,5.0,"Very good standard  This hotel is very convenient for Bristol airport and if booked well in advance offers good value parking packages.Breakfast is a good standard buffet.

The rooms are well appointed, the evening food of 'pub grub' standard, and breakfast is open access buffet to a reasonable standard. Hilton have got the offering and the mix right!"

Our car was already parked in the silver zone so we were left with 12 hours to kill at the airport   I rang the hotel and they immediately offered us a room for the day at £75.  This included a fantastic breakfast for 2.  The hotel staff were excellent great choice on the buffet brekkie.  Nice comfortable room that was spotlessly clean   We were able to relax for the day enjoy a drink in the bar and check out and walk 100 yards to the terminal to catch our evening flight feeling refreshed.   Next time we fly we will stay the night before in the wonderful hotel that ensures a perfect start to your holiday

919,lhershon,2018-05-31,4.0,"Ouch Parking stings! Yes it does, really and truly. We stayed a night over the bank holiday. We weren't using the airport but visiting relatives nearby. Let me say right now the hotel is really nice, modern, comfy, clean, and spacious it has a really good vibe and delicious breakfast. Ok so the menu is a bit limited for other times, but it is available 24/7 so I don't expect an enormous choice. Its ok price wise, not too expensive. The rooms were really light, spacious and very comfortable., Didn't hear a thing all night. So my only gripe is the parking. No where is it mentioned on the Hilton website and we had to pay the discounted rate of £16.50 for 15 hours in the hotel. I say thats a lot. Why its so dear I don't know but it lets down the Hilton and Id think twice about returning for that reason alone. If you stay at a hotel parking is usually thrown in or nominally £5 a day. So beware the hidden parking. Otherwise a lovely hotel experience."
920,pilgrim_father_47,2018-04-30,2.0,"An airport hotel - not really! If you are a young agile person with your backpack needing a stop-over before going off on a fun weekend to Amsterdam or if you are a business person needing a stop-over before going off to an important meeting in Berlin and if you can choose between a burger, a curry of the week or a salmon fillet then the Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport will meet your needs.
BUT, if you are a couple who are getting on in years who have never travelled light on a two-week holiday to the Med and who fancy something more than a burger, a curry of the week or a salmon fillet, then the Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport is definitely not for you.
The hotel is new, clean and quiet, BUT the menu is unbelievably limited and then there is the long and torturous walk from the hotel to the terminal – see photos. First you need to walk to the covered walkway, then walk up the gradual incline, then out into the open air and perhaps the rain, then a short walk to the first challenging 14 steps then another short walk before the next challenging 15 steps then onto the pavement, then negotiate the busy road in front of the airport, then finally into the terminal – sweating profusely and totally exhausted!
“Ah!” I hear the hotel staff say “But you do not need to climb the 29 steps. You can use the long and winding ramp and spend more time in the open air and perhaps in the rain.”
With just a bit of imagination Hilton could have employed a clever architect to design a covered walkway from a higher floor, accessed by a lift which could have provided direct covered access to the airport terminal. BUT alas, they didn’t!"
921,betertrycamping,2018-05-31,2.0,"Parking cost! Stayed at this hotel but we were not using the airport. The price for the room with breakfast was ok but the parking was expensive and a pain. I wasn't expecting the overnight £16.50 charge to park in the car park. Additionally everytime we went in and out of teh car park we had to get a ticket and persuade the people on the desk to give the 1 hour free.
Apart from that the room was good except for ne of the bath towels had stains on and the shower didn't drain properly and became a paddling pool."
922,slj20192019,2018-05-31,4.0,"Good Airport Hotel Stayed here with my husband for one night before a flight the following day. Hotel is perfectly located to the airport. I was concerned I would hear flights through the night as it is so close, but that's not the case. However what you can hear is noisy plumbing systems throughout the night, every time someone uses water you hear a loud noise through the ceiling! Bit of a shame because everything else was perfect, check in, staff, bar, room. Also breakfast was fantastic, some bad reviews of breakfast but on this occasion you couldn't ask for more. Would stay again if the noises get sorted."
923,RacheyPink,2018-05-31,5.0,"Perfect  We had an early morning flight and as we don't live close to the airport we stayed here the night before our flight. The hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from the terminal and a 10 minute walk from the long stay car park. The hotel also has its own car park. The location next to the terminal could not be better. Our room was clean, comfortable and very quiet. The shower was huge. The light from the clock was very bright but you can turn the display off whilst keeping the alarm set,  unfortunately we didn't discover that until the morning. Breakfast starts at 4am, and although at that time only continental is available there was plenty to chose from. The apple juice was horrible, it looked and tasted watered down, but that's the only thing we could fault. We enjoyed a meal and a couple of drinks in the bar, the chicken ceasar salad was delicious, the chicken was very tasty. Check in and check out was quick and easy. We weren't asked how our stay was when we checked out, but we were told to 'have a good day'. Will definately stay here again."
924,Wardsonthego,2018-04-30,4.0,"Great hotel - apart from the noisy plumbing! We stayed at this hotel ahead of an early flight to Portugal.  The hotel is modern, clean and the room we had was spacious and functional.  We ate dinner at the on site restaurant, the choice was good and the staff attentive, it was also good value for the location.  We had two issues, one was the noisy plumbing, in the middle of the night the plumbing would make various loud weird noises!  Bristol airport has not yet integrated its parking regime with that of the hotel.  So when we went to drop our bags off at the hotel before we parked the car, the parking system assumed that our long stay pre-booking had been activated, it then took our ticket when we left the hotel car park and would not recognise our booking at the long stay car park barrier.  Apparently this is a known problem that is being fixed!"
925,F1993SAdavidj,2018-05-31,4.0,"Nearly Great I stayed 1 night here before going on our holidays from Bristol airport. We paid approximately £80 for the night including breakfast which is quite reasonable. The hotel is directly opposite the terminal. The staff were very friendly and the hotel modern and clean. Nice large lounge area with lots of seating including flight time boards. The price for food and drinks is expensive, airport prices. On the whole I was very impressed especially on the cleanliness. The rooms were spacious and had everything we needed, TV, kettle, iron, hair dryer. My only faults were the noise. I had a very poor sleep for a number of reasons which may no affect everyone. The bathroom extractor fan was very noise, like a plane taking off. I had to cover it with a towel/toilet paper to make it quiet. All through the night there was clicking of switches, the sound of what I believe was water pipes/heating systems were very loud and seemed to be happening very regular. It wasn't even for water in our room. I can't really explain it well, maybe we were just unlucky on the 3rd floor but either way I was awake more than I was asleep. Also to be picky the alarm clock was very bright. Im not petty, just need quiet and darkness to sleep well, which I certainly didn't get. Other than that the bed was comfy, and had no other complaints. Would recommend with ear plugs :)"

Bright open reception/ bar/ lounge area.
The whole hotel is very light and airy
Bedroom well presented if a little small but with it being an on site Airport hotel, it is perfectly adequate. 
Eating here is very restricted- menu restricted to 3 basic items. I had a beef burger which could be described as just about adequate. Almost tempted to go to the M&S shop in the terminal for some food.
Overall, it’s ok for an overnight stay prior to catching a flight. 
Situated between terminal and car rental village it is very well positioned."

As we were travelling from south Wales we did not want the early morning hassle of the M4 so decided to stay for the night before.
I checked the wife in with our bags and took our car to the Airport tavern for the duration of the holiday, they dropped me back at the hotel in time for a couple of drinks in the bar before retiring to the room.
The room was comfortable with a lovely soft bed and tea making facilities. It was also very quiet.

930,nilufardi,2018-05-31,2.0,"Terrible food and poor menu We stayed here one night only. The family room was great, fresh and crunchy clean beds, welcoming atmosphere. No problems there.

The problem was the ""food"", if you can call it food. The menu is poor, limited, very little choice. I ordered beef burger and had to wait 30 minuted for it to arrive. Finally, it arrived and the look of it disgusted me to my stomach.  The burger bread was super dry, no sauce on it, then the beef which looked more like a rat's meet. The color was grey greenish, dry, and i mean just dry, a suspicious large not so fresh green leave on it and ta daaaa, enjoy your ""meal"", if you can say so.
I was very hungry, so closed my eyes and had a bite. It was the most disgusting burger i've ever tasted. It had no taste. It literally tasted like rat's meat. I am saying this, because that taste was uknown to me. (Rat's meat is uknown to me.)
It didn't end there. I complained and got it changed to the special chicken masala. It was ok, but because i was very very hungry.  I wasn't feeling good after the ""meal"", so eventually i got a sick stomach at night and before departure. I'm still not feeling well. I just hope they didn't spit in my ""food"", just because i asked to change it. Otherwise why would i get sick. 

I gope the management will see this and try to fix a better and more fresh menu. You are feeding humans after all and we pay for the good service, which we didn't get. 

Not happy at all!"

Booked the hotel turned up late in the evening only to be told it was for the other hotel. Not a problem same chain , no !! They wouldn’t transfer the booking, 10:45 pm they asked me to call my travel agent and cancel the booking , what a joke. I had no option other than pay again. Apparently it happens quite a lot . What a great business model. Whilst waiting to sort this out ,other customer were coming down saying there were people already sleeping in their  room , people were being wrongly charged for drinks they didn’t have. Couldn’t have been more comical had I stayed in Faulty Towers . Want an expensive laugh come and stay otherwise go somewhere else or stay at home."

933,janaffieux,2018-04-30,5.0,"Makes an early flight tolerable One of the most - if not THE most - comfortable, calming and quiet airport hotels imaginable. How do they insulate it so successfully so near to the airport?
Staff are very helpful.
Excellent selection for breakfast, which is available from very early. The dinner selection is limited, but acceptable.
Truly within walking distance of departures, as is the Hampton by Hilton at Stansted. And even closer to the car rental office, so if you are staying on arrival, don't bother to book your car till next morning. 
Every airport should have one!!"
934,Sammythesmiler,2018-04-30,4.0,"Convenient and quiet hotel    Having used this hotel before when we had an early start, we thought we would stay again for convenience and make the holiday longer with comfort. 

The first time we stayed here we had no major problems. The rooms were comfortable, with the sofa bed made up and had everything we needed. The only thing missing was an extra towel because there were only two and there were three of us and we could have asked to get one but it wasn’t essential. 

However, the second time we were less impressed that the sofa bed wasn’t even made up when we arrived. We had to do it ourselves and okay we could have asked but we shouldn’t have to. Again we didn’t have enough towels for the three of us but that wasn’t a major issue. 

However, that said, we have been impressed with the food in the bar and the drinks, although a little pricey but it’s understandable with the location. The breakfast seems very good and overall we were very happy. The hotel seemed quiet and comfortable and we will be back."

937,kathryng214,2018-04-30,2.0,"customer service I have stayed in the hotel now 9 times in the past year and each time I hope the service will improve ..sadly it hasn't .
Good hotel for those who just need to stay once whilst in transit for a flight . The food is ok bar food and the beds are good , but that is were it ends"
938,Thewhitefamilyuk,2018-04-30,5.0,Perfect Lovely clean modern hotel at a reasonable price. Friendly & efficient staff. Excellent location immediately opposite airport terminals but amazingly not noisy! Parking available at reduced rate. 24 hour availability snacks & refreshments. Both my husband & I have stayed here recently once on business and once as stopover for a late flight & we wouldn’t hesitate to stay again. We have previously struggled to find decent accommodation close to Bristol airport but thankful this lovely new hotel is perfect!
939,Eddylevel,2018-04-30,4.0,"Second visit I first stayed in this hotel back in the winter, as a sort of insurance against snowy roads stopping me from catching my flight. This time we stayed simply for the convenience of just having to make a short journey across the road to Departures. It’s clean and reasonably comfortable if not offering the most spacious of rooms, and we found it very quiet and restful. That’s about as much as can be said for it - it’s convenient and no more, you certainly wouldn’t want to stay there for a pleasurable break!"
940,simoncH840EE,2018-04-30,4.0,"Nice hotel, bad location unless visiting airport Hotel is great unless your not visiting the airport. Flight status screen in generous restaurant area. Lots of snacks fairly priced. Nice meals available. Not served by any takeaways and no grocery shops for miles. Nice staff. Remember to pay for your parking before driving to the barrier as reception only puts the discount on."
941,emmad534,2018-04-30,2.0,"Great location but very noisy at night We booked this hotel because we had an early morning flight from Bristol. We live 2 hrs away so wanted to not miss out on too much sleep the night before and be right on the doorstep on the day we were travelling. The room was very noisy at night. Either water pipes or a heating system located above our room above made so much noise I was awake past 2.30am and we needed to wake up at 3.30am! getting 1 hrs sleep before you travel is not ideal and completely defeated the objective of our stay. Our hotel stay was pointless as I was completely exhausted when we travelled the next day. We left the hotel quickly and there was no chance to give any feedback on departure. I had the impression from the level of interest we had from the receptionists upon check in, that they wouldn't have cared anyway.  On check in, I had a stamped birthday card I needed to post, and I asked the receptionist really nicely If I could please put it in your post box but she said 'we don't have one you will have to post it at the airport'. My husband and I both work in the hotel industry and I find it very hard to believe that any hotel/business address has no post collection service! As a result, my mother in law didn't get a birthday card because there was no post box at the airport. Our fault for not posting it on the way to Bristol, but we never thought twice about the fact that we couldn't be able to post it at the hotel, and I was really shocked at the unwillingness to help from the receptionist. Room was clean, and the restaurant staff very friendly. Food was ok, but a very limited menu. Hotel has a very fresh and modern feel, and the location is the best feature without question. However, if you're looking for a good nights seep, don't expect one!"
942,stefanocL6891AS,2018-04-30,1.0,"The noisiest room I have ever been The hotel is clean and tidy but there is no insulation in the rooms, so we could hear noises all night long from corridor, other rooms and plants. The bathroom vent was so noisy that we had to take the card off the slot to turn it off.
Parking overnight costs an awful lot of money. 
There is a good selection of food for breakfast.
After a night awake we are not so keen to come back to this hotel and strongly suggest to anybody to avoid this hotel."
943,CORNISHGIRLXX,2018-04-30,3.0,"Stop over before morning flight  I had high expectations about this hotel as it has recently been built I assumed they would have learnt all the mistakes of other hotels - but no it appears they have totally ignored them !
The room is actually very nice, it was clean and had nice facilities. It is however an airport hotel - but this is the noisiest airport hotel I have ever stayed in. There appears to be very little soundproofing as I could hear a lot of noise for outside during the night and also water and creaking noise from above the ceiling - thinking it was the air con I turned this off in the night but to no avail the noise was still there it can be heard above the entrance part of the room ALL night - room 202. 
I reported this to reception in the morning but mostly the girls on reception then were too busy talking amongst themselves to be remotely interested in the fact that I was complaining and just said sorryyyy and carried on talking. So customer service has not been fought either. 
I am very disappointed and will probably revert back to the holiday inn in the future."
944,grahame745,2018-04-30,5.0,"Great start to a holiday Six of us stayed here before an early flight the following day. A very smooth booking in process. We all met up in the restaurant for a meal and a drink and the service and food was good. A good choice of drinks in the bar at a reasonable price, this was followed by a good night's sleep and an excellent breakfast the following morning. We used Silver Zone for parking and this all worked out very convenient."
945,Lizzie72,2018-04-30,4.0,"Great stopover pre-flight A long overdue hotel on the airport grounds! Perfect when you have a 5am check in, just a minute walk away. We found our room was modern, very comfortable bed, great shower room, in fact, could not fault it at all. Staff were very pleasant, service was good, all in all excellent value and very glad we gave it a try. We'll be back!"
946,paulamw2016,2018-04-30,5.0,"Good value We paid £149 for a one night stay, breakfast and 5 nights parking in the silver zone. It included a very good continental breakfast which could be taken away.
The beds were comfortable and the room was excellent - the bathroom was particularly nice with beautiful smelling shower gel and plenty of towels.
Despite being at the airport, we didn’t hear the noise of aircraft.
We’d definitely use it again"
947,AlisonT165,2018-04-30,3.0,Nice enough Given there is no other hotel on Bristol airport this hotel is ok. The food choice limited but on a par with other budget hotels. The down side was having to pull our cases through thick mud from the long stay car park to hotel. Until the construction work is finished I would recommend using silver zone and catching the bus back to terminal/hotel. The receptionist could also deal with complaints about the mud a lot better. This hotel is fine but needs competition.
948,Z4466FKalanh,2018-04-30,2.0,"Convenient, but that’s about it. We booked a family room (2 x adults and 2 x children) as our youngest child had an early flight in the morning. On arrival we were very impressed - the hotel is very modern and well presented, however after we checked in our first experience of a “Hampton by Hilton Hotel” went rapidly downhill. The room was really just for 3 people, a nice double bed, but with a rock hard and small sofa bed (quite cosy for a 14 year old and his 11 year old brother) 3 x towels and 2 mugs. Really disappointed. I did suggest to the management that it was not really fit for our purpose but their response was we could have another room for an additional £50 - hardly helpful (we thought we had booked a family room, at £120 we certainly paid for one), but I picked up on where the focus appears to lie. The evening meals were expensive and underwhelming (I have had bigger starters than the curry I had); add on the leaving whammy of paying another £16.50 (on top of the £120 already paid for the box room) just to park the car over night and the whole experience was over priced and pretty dreadful. That said the staff were fantastic and they deserve better than trying to defend this rather poor offering. Premier Inn for me next time, sure it’s a 15 / 20 min drive away, but is superior in every department - convenience is great but it’s a mistake to abuse that and from what my family experienced (on our first visit) we would not risk it again."
949,JoeOrdinary,2018-04-30,4.0,Does the job well. I am guessing no one stays here who’s not flying. And as a sleep over just before or just after you fly it does the job well. £80 ish is fine and includes a surprisingly good breakfast. Staff good. Rooms clean and contain all you need. Would I want to stay here for a week? No. Is it ok for a flight sleepover? 100% yes.
950,AlisonW26,2018-04-30,3.0,"Great accommodation shocking food I have to admit my first impression was of pleasant surprise. The hotel is modern, the check in efficient, the room lovely. The dinner was a real let down. There was a really limited menu. We waited a while, but didn’t mind as we’re starting our holiday. My daughter’s pizza was really good but our chicken burgers were shocking. Cold, cold onion rings, cold chips, leathery chicken breast and wilted salad. We politely returned the food and it was returned in a similar condition, luke warm onion rings, very hot chips, leathery and cold chicken breast and the same wilted salad. When we complained a second time we ordered a pepperoni pizza, which was v hot and v pleasant. However , there was no offer of reducing the bill or compensatory drinks. Very average. Which is a shame as the environment was lovely. We topped up on food from M&S at the terminal."
951,gillybobs,2018-03-31,4.0,Served its puropse clean comfortable and quiet We booked in in March as we had an early morning flight and we had so much snow didn't want to risk leaving in the early hours. Very clean warm and friendly staff . Not really a restaurant but more a pub like bar service. We did not eat there food looked ok though. As it was an early  flight not much choice for breakfast think it should reflect on price.
952,Ninion,2018-02-28,4.0,"Excellent Choice ! A very good hotel next (walking distance) to the airport. Rooms are nice decorated and well equipped.  Limited but good quality , options for dinner. Breakfast was very good. Overall an excellent choice if you want to stay (very) close to the airport."
953,969suziea,2018-04-30,4.0,"Perfect for an early morning flight We parked in Silver Park and got the complimentary shuttle to the airport (roughly five minutes at the most), then walked another five minutes to the hotel. It's very well signposted (and well-lit when we walked back to the airport in the wee hours of the morning), and at the moment is the only hotel on the actual airport itself. We checked in at about 8 pm and there was a little bit of a queue but didn't take very long. We are fortunate enough to be Gold Members and it was a surprise to receive two tokens for a free soft drink and a snack each for me and my other half. Snacks consist of crisps and chocolates and then there's waters or some fizzy alternatives; I thought this was a really nice touch. 

Our room was on the third floor, very well put together, new, fresh, whites mixed with aqua-marine, soft sea blue and natural earth tones throughout. Perfectly fine bathroom with a large shower; the entrance to the room hosted a huge mirror, then there was a small entertainment unit with TV and tea/coffee making facilities, adjacent to a desk with wheelie chair and opposite a small two-person L-shaped couch, large bedside table/draws and a queen comfy bed. Even though the air conditioning was off it was loud throughout the night, banging and making strange noises, waking me up on several occasions; this is the only thing that I'd say was less than great.  

We received a complimentary continental breakfast (which starts at 4 am and ends at 6 am I believe, then there's a hot breakfast after that). We had a time for a swift espresso, few slices of meat and cheese, a croissant and some fruit. Love that there are so many charging points through the hotel, both in the room and in the very stylish check desk come bar and dining areas. 

Overall, a great hotel and a very reasonable place to stay before an early morning flight."
954,dmbthb,2018-03-31,4.0,"Ideal for an Early Flight We stayed here in readiness for an early flight so did not really use any of the amenities, however, the room was comfortable and the early breakfast was very adequate.  The hotel is very close to the terminal so no problems getting there.

We were able to obtain a competitive rate for the one night stay.

The advertised nightly parking charge is £16.50 which seems rather expensive but other than that, very good."
955,kimmX5419JY,2018-03-31,3.0,"Good location but uncomfortable  Cannot fault the location for a morning flight, a quick walk across the road.

Breakfast was brilliant, but we were not very impressed with the evening meal the night before and our expectations are not high.

We had a disruptive night sleep with a noisy fan that kept waking us up.  The bedding was not the most comfortable and the sofa bed for the kids did not look the safest due to exposed parts / big gap that the little one could get trapped in."
956,pembrokeshire1,2018-04-30,4.0,"Mr Nice hotel only problems were the queen room we had the bed was 9inches away from the side of the wall on one side, difficult to get in and out of bed. 
The shower also had a problem in that as you showered the water would splash out of the basin you stood in and flood the bathroom floor which inventually also went into the bedroom. You dont notice this while having your shower.
Breakfast was ok nothing special and no were near the choices you have at the Premier Inn."
957,SeanMendis,2018-03-31,5.0,"Convenient and efficient The hotel is literally steps away from the airport, so the perfect location if you have an early or late flight. The rooms are the typical Hampton brand standard - clean and functional - and the staff are friendly. Breakfast is served from 0400hrs which is convenient if you have an early departure. Dinner is served at the bar with a limited but perfectly adequate menu for a quick bite. However the main selling point here is the convenience of location and it simply cannot be beaten on that front."
958,Gorthleckgirl,2018-03-31,4.0,"Very Comfortable Arrived here to stay for the night before a flight. I was really cold from having a long journey to get to the hotel, staff were welcoming and the hotel/room were lovely and warm.  Food is available to order in room or at the restaurant.

The shower in the room was great, and no shortage of hot water. Would defo stay here again !"

Parking for the night was 16.50, which was a little expensive. Moved car next morning to the Silverstone before our flight. Would definatly  stay again but will not leave the car  overnight again."
960,AlisonD717,2018-04-30,4.0,"Stayed one night before an early flight Very clean, good facilities, friendly staff.  The soundproofing is not great though.  We could hear people in the next room plugging things in and flushing the toilet.  There was also a hissing sound going on most of the night - not sure what it was as we switched the heating/aircon off and it wasn't coming from the bathroom.  Sadly didn't sleep much."
961,alanw258,2018-02-28,3.0,"Very early flight meant overnight in area , on site at airport, Not for me again. having a very early flight out of Bristol had us choosing this accommodation. For modern hotel it only had a very austere bar area. Not at all comfortable with being as it seemed in a shopping concourse . Open cold and featureless. It was very windy and cold even snowing outside and the huge automatic doors let blasts of freezing air into the space. Resorted to eating back on the A38 as to eat here - and only a burger type menu was very unappealing. The room itself was a bit cool but that was due to the heating system not having enough oomph to heat the hotel I suspect. Bonus an airport display board arrivals and departures made keeping abreast of the flight easy. Another negative , the breakfast self service area  is lacking in signing and searching out associated items butter for toast and milk for cereals - where are the bowls ? etc. made that an inconvenient start to the day as others were also milling about trying to make sense of this too.  Parking fees are extortionate beware . Luckily we had a hire car to overcome these costs ."
962,Grumpybrother,2018-04-30,4.0,"Nice place, good location, couple of niggles This place is ideally located for the airport (literally minutes away by foot). The rooms were clean and well furnished which one would expect from a new hotel, albeit small. 

Anybody reading the website would know that parking is charged for, so be prepared for that, but the good news is that it is reduced for those staying overnight.

The breakfast was reasonable and there was a good choice between continental and cooked (depending on the time of the morning). Having read about the food situation we opted to find a local hostelry to eat in for dinner, but the added bonus was that we were able to have the first parking period for free: we only paid for the subsequent overnight parking.

I will agree with some contributors that the heating was not overly brilliant and was occasionally marred by loud clunks from the system. The thermostat also did not seem to be very effective as the room remained cold even when set to the maximum of 25 degrees.

Staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. This did appear to be a calm period so people did not appear to be rushed off their feet, so cannot comment on what it would be like during busy periods.

Would stay here again if necessary and would recommend to others with the caveats about eating, parking and heating."
963,665leilaj,2018-03-31,4.0,Great for an early morning departure Checking was very quick and pleasant staff.  The room is a decent size and has good amenities.  There are shower gel dispensers and shampoo together with iron and board and tea and coffee facilities. There is a normal alarm clock too.  The bed was very comfortable and there was a 2 seater sofa corner unit in the room together with a desk and chair and a good size tv. Upon check in I asked whether I could have a breakfast done up to take with me. I was advised that breakfast (continental only) would be open from 4am and boxes would be provided and to help myself. I checked out early morning and went to grab a take out box - none were to be found anywhere. I asked at reception and was met by a stern faced receptionist. After about a 10 minute hunt around the bar and breakfast area a pack was found.  There were also no napkins which I had to ask for.  I would recommend a stay if you are having an early morning departure but good luck with the breakfast.
964,phleby,2018-03-31,3.0,"Great location. We stayed here on 7th March before an early morning flight.We checked in at 7pm and the bar area was packed. This is also the restaurant area which is all open plan. Our room was lovely, very clean and a big comfy bed. However, the air conditioning made a very loud noise. Throughout the night it would kick in with a bang which constantly woke us both. We were up at 4.45 for our flight and were absolutely shattered! We ate in the restaurant and like other reviews, the service was terrible, so slow. We ordered a pizza and duck spring rolls, which were very tasty but we waited well over an hour! We had a continental breakfast as we were too early for  the hot food option but it was plentiful. We did complain to the very nice receptionist about the noisy air con and lack of sleep and she refunded the room amount (£84) with no quibbles.Fair play, this was brilliant and unexpected.
The hotel is approx 5 minutes walk from the terminal either via steps or a ramp, some of the walk is through a well lit tunnel, it is very easy to find, alongside the long stay car park.We would definitely stay here again but would email beforehand for a quieter room."
965,marqueemark2016,2018-03-31,4.0,"You don't have to compromise for convenience Literally, a two minute walk with bags from the airport.  And a two minute walk from long-term parking. Price-wise, at least comparabe with other hotels nearby that require a shuttle bus.  And all very shiny new and classy. The room was well equipped.  Just what you want from an airport hotel.  The restaurant menu was somewhat limited, but the pizza we ordered more than did the job. Two quibbles: the alarm call we booked didn't happen - make sure to set your own alarms!  And the pillows are horrible slabs of hard foam. Top tip: if leaving your car, BRING YOUR OWN PILLOWS from home, and spend five minutes in the morning taking them back to your car."

Booked at last minute , very busy on arrival , very nice room , extremley  clean and modern . However service at bar was appalling , 15 minute queue to order , was told it would be 45 minutes for food however it actually arrived after 1 hour and 15 mins , and that was after another 10 min queue to ask where food was 
Which was only a burger , chips and nachos ! 
On arrival chips were warm and nachos had been thrown in a bowl with most of the cheese on the outside of the bowl 
Staff were so slow 
I get that it was a busy Bank holiday and probably minimum levels of staff but service was abmismal and the supervisor was useless , no manager around to speak too 
Topped of by the outrageous parking charge of 16.50 for staying at hotel , very disappointing for a Hilton chain hotel"

It was very convenient and the room was excellent.  Very clean.  Warm. Dark Perfect.  I have only given 4 out of 5 because I think it is unacceptable to have to pay to drop someone off outside the hotel.  The charge was £1 but surely you should pay to drop off in front of the hotel.  And there were no breakfast boxes to pick up on our way out, which had been promised the evening before.  We'd be very happy to stay again and it would have been a 5 if these niggles had not existed."

There is one hour free parking outside the hotel so you can check in and drop off your bags. You can then park wherever you like for your holiday. 

Check in was straight forward and welcoming. 

The lobby area is quite informal and relaxing with a bar area along with 3/4 televisions. It also has the airport feed with flight arrival and departure times live.

Rooms seem fresh and clean. Tv, tea/coffee facilities, good sized shower along with complementary shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Plenty of towels. Hairdryer, iron and ironing board as standard along with a room safe. Extra tea and coffee were available from reception.

Lots of freeview channels and free WiFi.

Continental breakfast is served from 4am which had a variety of cereals, pastries, waffles, teas, coffee, dairy and vegan milk, juices and fruit. Full breakfast available from 6am. 

Hotel shuttle available to the terminal but only a very short walk with steps or ramp for those with mobility issues. 

Overall, an excellent stay. 

Would like to see some sort of outdoor space for time to relax the day before or after a flight."
973,AthinaCon,2018-03-31,4.0,Ok stay Booked a night with my mother for 2 nights. One night was when she was arriving in the UK from the airport and when she was leaving about 10 days after. I was very excited when I first saw the rooms. However the room was very noisy and the duvets were very thin. I understand that they are trying to fix the noise pollution problem and improve the heating system. I had an issue with the payment as it seemed like they made me pay twice for the room. I talked about this to the reception lady just before I left but she was rude about it. I then called them after I left the hotel and they were relatively helpful and the matter was resolved. I appreciate the help. I would stay at the hotel again as I really enjoyed the breakfast and the location of the hotel is great. The rooms are ok but they have to fix the issues.

If you are Disable or cant walk too far this could be a problem, coming from the airport its all downhill, with either lots of stairs or for wheel chairs a zig zag path that seems a lot more than the quoted 250M especial when you have the misfortune to do this journey when poring down with rain and icy which is was for us."

Only issue was the shower easily flooded due to the 'wet room' type style of base but we easily mopped this up. We ate in the restaurant in the evening, there was not a great deal of choice and what we had was pricey but sufficient. I did not find the staff very friendly or welcoming considering they weren't particularly busy. Had a good night's sleep and had a small breakfast of cold food items at 4.30am before we left.

On returning to hotel, coat was not in lost property. The receptionist said lost property often gets mislaid, as it had been a ""hectic"" weekend after the snow and would post it on, when it was found. Another call to hotel, 3 days later no call returned from manager. nothing has been recieved in the post.. We realise my daughter should take some responsibility, But it should have been safe in the room. Honesty is always a big thing with us and this coat cost more than the booking.

984,WelshgirlMel,2018-03-31,4.0,"Very good hotel for an airport hotel and a decent price too We stayed here recently and thought it was a good airport hotel. The rooms were clean, modern and fresh looking and a decent size too. The foyer is large and open plan, you can order food and drinks in the foyer. No restaurant as such and a limited food menu - pizza, burgers and sandwiches basically. Considering there is only a couple of cafes in the terminal before security and no other restaurant nearby you would think the food options would be better.

One note - do not order the chicken burger as it was awful! Saying that the breakfast was good and included in with the price. 

The best thing is that it is a short walk to the airport, less than 5 minutes and is the nearest hotel by far. We did not hear any plane noise which I was amazed about.

We would definitely stay again, but please sort your chicken burger out!"
985,W1779KVjob,2018-03-31,3.0,"Convenient however poor service on this occasion Very convenient as on the airport site with a short walk to the terminal. From that point of view, you cannot get anywhere closer.
We stayed on the weekend with particularly poor weather (the beast from the east!) and we have been told that the very lengthy queues for the bar were down to staff not being able to make it in for their shift. Lets just say that we had a 90 mile trip to get there and although it took a little longer than usual, we made it....therefore we only partially accept this explanation.
No eggs at breakfast and we accept that the hotel did n to get a delivery due to poor weather however again, with good forecasting the F&B Manager could have taken this into consideration perhaps (we were all warned about the weather)?
As mentioned, if you want somewhere next to the airport, it's 'ok'"
986,Bonio,2018-03-31,3.0,"Airport hotel ...so it's noisy Located 2 minutes down the hill from the terminal....But that's also its downfall. The place is .....ok I suppose. The rooms are not very well sound proofed and the early morning showers on each side of our room were noisy. The breakfast was enjoyable with pretty good choices.

If I was getting a flight before 9 am I might book again, as I'd be in the early morning shower too.....but I definitely would not stay here if returning on a late flight. The water pipes really were too noisy around 6 am. Also I didn't like the pillows at all. Too springy."
987,TruroTim,2018-03-31,2.0,"Very poor service Stayed here on outward journey to our recent holiday and surprised that there was no Bacardi behind bar !  Also very basic food and very small menu . Although it is convenient for morning flight .
On return we also stayed as got back at 23.00 and wanted a good sleep before drive home . Checked in no problem , rooms clean . Went to bar for a quick drink before bed (Not Bacardi obviously) to be greeted by a very charming member of staff called Landra, (Not!!) Decided she couldn't cope with the 8 people that we're there and shut the 24hr bar ! She spent so long arguing over how busy she was that it wouldve been quicker to serve customers , only to turn around and do her hair in the mirror ! So we decided to go to bed . Next morning we went down for breakfast which was ok but no eggs due to weather when all the roads were clear . Surely a member of staff could've just pooped to local shop and bought some ? 
On top of this when showering the water wouldn't drain away so only 1 of 3 of us got showered ! In our other room there was a turd I  the toilet on arrival as well . 
Decided to report our issues on check out and to be fair to receptionist she said she would discuss with manager and discount our bill , which we accepted . Only for them to charge my credit card full amount literally minutes after we left !!
Have stayed at premier inn sidcot on several occasions and will be next time as well . If you only want a convenient room then this will be ok ish , but not for me again .
Prefer somewhere where they make you feel welcome , do good food and actually have some drinks behind bar.  
Save money ... don't stay here !!!"

989,55BoraB,2018-03-31,3.0,"Convenient for Airport Terminal We stayed here for one night during the extreme Winter snow #Beast from the East. This new modern Hotel is in a great location and conveniently situated for the terminal just a short walkway partially covered then steps up to the terminal. This proved challenging in the deep snow and carrying the luggage up the steps was tricky as the snow had not been cleared.  The room was comfy and clean but unfortunately even with the thermostat set as high as it would go at 25 degrees there was little heat. The bathroom was also very cold, not what you want when it's freezing outside and a blizzard. There seemed to be a problem with the entire ventilation system it was clattering & banging and woke us several times during the night. I thought someone was trying break into the room! The duvet was also quite thin so little warmth to get from that. The safe in our room had several numbers on the keypad that wouldn't register so a bit random finding a pin that worked to lock it. We had two friends with us who also experienced the same issues in their room and a safe that wouldn't lock! The public areas were also not very warm but it was extreme weather outside. The doors kept sliding open to allow people in and out at both entrances to the Hotel which created a very drafty wind tunnel it was freezing if you were sat nearby. There were plenty of seating areas in the bar and a reasonable menu of snacks and meals. The food was acceptable and we didn't wait too long for the burgers we ordered. There's a very good choice at the buffet breakfast serving continental from 4am or hot breakfast choices from 6am. The staff were very friendly & helpful, I would have given a higher rating had I felt cozy & warm and the noise from the ventilation wasn't an issue in us getting a good night sleep. Being a Hilton Honors member we have experienced other Hampton Inns of better standard. Maybe we'll stay in two weeks time as we have another trip booked it was so convenient and hopefully things will be much improved including the weather!!"
990,NamShanMan,2017-09-30,3.0,"Hilton Hotel Bristol Airport The hotel is adjacent to the terminal building, very convenient and modern, clean rooms etc.. however....be wary if requesting an alarm call.  The one we booked wasn't made, fortunately we were awake.  We mentioned this to the reception at check out and they were rather indifferent and tried to make some excuse.  Not good enough.  People book hotel airports generally because they have an early departure or late arrival.  Why else would you choose to stay at the airport.  Wanted to alert other travellers to be aware of this."
991,idleauk,2018-02-28,2.0,"Generally OK but some key areas for improvement To start with the positives, the hotel is well located for the terminal, check-in/out was efficient and the room/hotel was clean with a comfortable bed and chair.  The inclusive breakfast was also a good spread, although felt a little canteen-like (but I appreciate this I almost certainly the 'brand style').  Unfortunately there were several key aspects which made my stay rather disappointing, especially for the rates currently being charged.

Firstly signage from the terminal is less than ideal.  On approach from the airport flyer bus stop it felt right to walk under the covered walkway which was straight ahead, but I ended up in a carpark (with the hotel to my right, the other side of a fence and road).  Luckily there was a parking attendant who directed me back to terminal and across the zebra crossing opposite the arrivals door.  At this point I did see the hotel signage and the remainder of the route was obvious.  This sign would be visible when exiting the terminal, but is not in line of sight for those walking along the footpath.  Unless I missed another sign, I think signage could definitely be improved.

Secondly, as a diamond elite member I was entitled to a complimentary drink and snack from the bar, using the voucher supplied at check-in.  Unfortunately the queue for the bar was extremely long (15-20 mins), and didn't seem to get any shorter all night!  It was clear that everyone was ordering food alongside drinks, and staff couldn't cope.  In my case to avoid the lengthy wait it would have been helpful if the voucher could have been redeemed at the check-in desk, but separate to this there must be another way to speed up the queue.  It also didn't seem a great design that the queue blocks the main walkway between entrance and check-in, and that every time the main door opened we were stood in a cold draught.  Newspapers around the seating area were also several days old.

I was aware of ongoing issues with the air conditioning in guest rooms, having already read many reviews on Trip Advisor.  I contacted the hotel a couple of days prior to my stay, and was assured that only a handful of rooms were impacted.  Despite the cold night, I made a point of making sure the system was off before going to sleep but regrettably I was awoken several times during the night with very loud clicking and 'whooshing' noises.  There was little point trying to get moved to another room at that time so I sat it out but was very frustrated (and quite cold, because the duvet seemed quite thin).  A related problem also appears to be the metal grilles under the A/C units above the door entrance which rattle.  I am amazed that this issue was not identified and rectified prior to opening, or certainly not before now.  I am also very surprised that as a known problem, highlighted as applicable to my stay at check-out, that no compensation by way of a points gesture was offered.

I have thought carefully about what rating to give my review, however unfortunately my experience was lower than I would expect for this type of hotel.  As a result I cannot currently rate it as average or higher, however I would happily return once the air conditioning is 'fixed', and expect the rating should then be at least 4 out of 5."

We ate downstairs in the lounge / bar area, menu was ok with a few hot dishes and toastie. Short walk from the terminal, ramp plus steps and last 100 yards is a well lit covered walkway. Building work in car park behind hotel did not impact with noise."
996,732helena,2018-03-31,4.0,"Very convenient, clean & good value Given the recent travel problems caused by the snow, we changed our origin plan to travel down for a very early morning flight to booking a hotel room for the night before. 

It was a good plan! The room was clean, bright and airy with all the facilities you might need (including hairdryer!) The bed was very comfy and the room had more power points than I have ever seen in a hotel room before. The Wi-fi was free and worked well throughout the hotel. The staff were helpful and friendly. 

There is not a huge menu for the evening meal; it is somewhat limited, but if you like a burger, pizza, curry or salad, you’ll be fine. It was however a bit draughty in the lounge/ dining area. These are the only aspects which brought down my scoring. 

If you’re travelling early, they have a buffet continental breakfast available from 4 am and that is included in the cost. We paid £77 for a double room on a Friday night which for an airport hotel, I thought was excellent value. 

It is a short walk to the terminal building, so very convenient."

Room was large with a lovely bathroom and also a very nice TV. Most of the satellite channels worked which was a bonus as I usually find the range limited.

Main bed was very comfy so I'm informed as I was relegated to the sofa bed which was a bit hard but not uncomfortable enough to ruin my stay

Five minutes walk to the terminal and car parking right outside = family friendly and less stress

Prices are typical for food and drink ie more than I like to pay but not unexpected

Food service was very fast possibly helped by limited choice

1007,TJeffP,2018-01-31,5.0,"Convenient location and efficient service As we live a long way from the airport we booked an overnight stay before an early flight. We chose a package including car parking for the duration of our holiday. Entry to the car park was straight forward as the system recognised the number of the car and gave us a prepaid ticket.  We parked as close to the hotel as possible. We have had trouble finding our car at Bristol before as the car park is very big so we took a phone photo of the sign marking the space. 

Access to the hotel was a bit difficult as they are building a multi storey car park and a large area is fenced off. We should have off loaded the bags at the hotel then parked to save dragging heavy cases a long way.

The hotel is only about two years old so is modern and tidy. Check in was handled efficiently and we were soon in our room. The accommodation was as expected in this style of hotel with everything needed for an overnight stay and well presented.  After a comfortable sleep we awoke early as we aimed to be at check in by 5.30am. A cold buffet is served from 4.00 am.  Checkout was simple and we had some breakfast before walking to the terminal. Much of the route is under cover but does involve a climb up to the terminal entrance. There are steps for a direct route or ramps suitable for cases on wheels. This route is longer so allow time. A bit of early morning exercise is a good idea before a four hour flight.

Picking up the car on our return was simple, aided by the photo, and we were soon on our way.

Altogether a comfortable well organised hotel making for a convenient departure from Bristol Airport. We will certainly use it again in the future."
1008,SueEd65,2018-02-28,3.0,"Convenient, but not good value. Stayed at hotel prior to our half term trip to the Algarve a couple of nights ago.  There were a few positives to our experience there, but also a few disappointments. On the positive side, the hotel is clean, staff extremely pleasant and attentive and the hotel is very convenient for Bristol airport.  However, there were a few niggles to our experience; the dinner menu has very little choice and not good value for money, you have to collect you own cutlery from baskets, which I found most unhygienic, who knows what dirty hands have previously been rummaging through the baskets? The rooms are extremely small, so cramped, made worse if you have an extra bed in the room for a child. We had to leave the  hotel by 6am, as the majority of most of their customers would, we couldn't smell a sausage, no cooked breakfast prior to 6am which is very disappointing as you rave ""start the day with a hot buffet breakfast included in your stay"" - would be interested to know how many guests miss out on the cooked breakfast because they need to leave by 6am. The last niggle for us was the walk in the dark, fully laden with golf clubs and suitcases, we experienced no lights up the pathway to the airport and two or three sets  of steps to negotiate. You should be proud of your staff at Hampton by Hilton Bristol hotel, but you need to improve on the basics that you can address as it's not cheap to stay there (you obviously can't change the room size now, but take it forward to the next project!!).

As mentioned in some of the previous reviews there was noise from the air conditioning unit. Sleeping was difficult as the noise would start without notice.  The hotel is replacing the entire air conditioning system at the start of next year so you may experience some noise in the meantime.  The room was also cold and the beds were hard.

I tried turning it off, on, hot, cold, and each time it would be silenced then after half an hour or so then either rattle like an old fridge (10 x louder) or screech very loudly until I adjusted the controls again.

Too tired to go and face the hassle of asking for an alternative room, I lay in bed shivering under a paper thin duvet and accepted that I would not get any rest whatsoever.

Getting here from Bristol train station using the Airport Shuttle bus – cost £8 each for a single – and that bus dropped us off right outside the terminal. From there it was a short walk across a couple of pedestrian crossings and down a flight or two of steps, though there is a separate ramped route, to the hotel.

When we checked in we were attended to by very friendly and helpful front desk staff.

Comfy room, good size nice easy chair and footstool, good desk chair and writing desk facility, decent television, kettle and coffee making facilities, comfy bed and nice bedlinen. 
Wedidn’t find it immediately, but there is a safe in the top drawer of the bedside chest.

The room was very quiet even though we were right beside the airport.

There was a well appointed shower room and good shower; shampoo, conditioner and soap dispensers in shower, and hand soap and body lotion dispensers also beside the wash handbasin.

There was good wardrobe hanging space, and an effective heating system, except it made other noises intermittently at night even after we turned turn it off. Had to turn off bedside clock because put out so much light which disturbed our sleep.

The excellent broadband was very easy to connect to, though on an unsecured network. 

There is a decent restaurant area, contemporary furnishings nicely done, and we had a nice cheeseburger and chips and drinks provided very promptly after ordering.

A continental breakfast is available from 4 AM and cooked breakfasts from 6 AM. We had to leave to catch a very early flight and so we used continental breakfast. Good selection of cereals, pastries, cold meats, fruit, toaster and brown and white bread, coffee from an automatic machine dispensed different sorts of coffee. “Carry out” bags are available if you just wanted to grab a few bits and make yourself breakfast “to go”.

In all this was a very comfortable and convenient experience for us. Very easy to find a hotel, and it has plenty of parking if you want driving to it, and it is only a very few minutes walk across to the departures airport terminal.

Big bonus-- breakfast starts at 4am which is great if you are flying at 7 as we were.Then only about a 5 minute walk up to departures!! 
I will stay there again next time I fly out of Bristol."

Very clean hotel commune all areas and rooms Bed is good , shower hot and powerful . An hours free parking for hotel guests . Everything you need from an airport hotel with friendly staff on top . Continental breakfast served from very early - a great plus point"
1025,misslaa,2017-09-30,5.0,"Cannot recommend highly enough! Excellent Hotel. I have stayed here on 2 separate occasions and would highly recommend this hotel to others. The location is fantastic! It is located directly across the road from Bristol airport (3 minute walk!). The hotel itself is very modern. The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable and I have not experienced any noise disturbance during either of my stays. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The bar food is excellent and there are a varied range of dishes to choose from. Breakfast is automatically included in the price of your room and is open from 5am which is fantastic if you have to catch an early flight. I must point out that I personally found the room price in this hotel extremely reasonable, and was surprized on my first visit to discover that breakfast was automatically included. I have often paid higher rates in other hotels just for the room alone! The hotel is located approx 30 minutes from Bristol city centre. We take the airport shuttle bus from Temple Meads train station out to the airport/hotel and have also used it when going from the hotel into the city centre. It is very convenient as it runs frequently and is reasonably priced. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to others and hope to stay here again when flying in/out of Bristol."
1026,Gwg1211,2017-10-31,4.0,"Very small  I came with my family of 4, two adults, a 16 year old and a 13 year old. We booked a family room and were quite shocked to discover that meant one double bed and a sofa bed. This was a big shock and also a big disappointment. The rest of the hotel was good, it was clean and very convenient being next  to the airport. The breakfast was average and the staff were very nice. Would recommend if you have an early flight but be aware of room sizes"
1027,bob1323,2018-01-31,5.0,"BRILLIANT AIRPORT HOTEL... LONG NEEDED AT BRISTOL Excellent hotel at Bristol Airport.  I had booked in as my flight landed at 00.30 and did not want a 2hour drive home.  Access to the hotel which is across the road and down steps or a long ramp could be a little easier, but there is lots of building going on so maybe this will be rectified.  The hotel itself is brand spanking new and has all the facilities you would want.  The rooms are modern and really fitted out well, the bed is really soft and the pillows are a dream.  Breakfast the next morning is very much a help yourself arrangement but you cannot fault the choice.  The cooked could have been a bit warmer, but it is the same in most buffet type hotels.  I am really glad to have this hotel now as before you could only ever stay near the airport so if returning could not have a drink on the flight as you would need to drive at least a few miles.  Happy days."
1028,PeterandBeccy,2018-01-31,4.0,Spot on convenience  Arrived in Bristol late. Straight onto a shuttle bus from Temple Meads (£8) which stopped by the hotel. Swift check in. Comfortable bed. Breakfast helpfully served from 4am (though not hot breakfast until later). 2 minute walk from hotel to terminal building in pouring rain which was not all under cover (yet). Very convenient though and highly recommended if you have an early flight out of Bristol.
1029,891georgek,2018-01-31,1.0,"Dinner Was very disappointed with the salmon meal , it was extremely dry ,in my opinion it was microwaved , my opinion, there was so much green beans they would have fed 6 diners , two very small new potatoes sliced to make it look more,altogether a very unpalatable dish ,did mention it to bar staff and was offered a cup of tea !!!  Was not a cheap meal either."
1030,Lawsonio1,2018-01-31,4.0,"Not too bad Stayed in room 9, on the ground floor in a double room.
Room was clean, tidy, quiet but lacked character....but to be honest this hotel is serving a purpose for the airport only.
We ate in the restaurant in the evening and the portions are generous.
Breakfast is included and starts at 4am!
Will probably stay again next time I am on business and need to stay close to the airport."
1031,Seatonlady,2018-01-31,4.0,"Ideal Newly opened, nice design. Literally 2 minutes walk away from the departure lounge. Excellent for an overnight stay if you have an early morning flight.

1032,NZAnnaMc,2018-01-31,3.0,"Perfectly fine for an airport hotel  It did its job being across the road from airport ... room was a little noisy but very clean and very comfortable

Usual great service as you would expect from Hilton! The breakfast was again as expected at Hilton."
1034,Eddylevel,2018-01-31,5.0,"So convenient I booked this hotel before my flight because I was concerned about forecasts of snow during the night - a false alarm as it turned out,but worth it all the same because it made life so much easier. It’s not very well signposted if you’re on foot - I was trudging through some filthy cold,wet weather after parking my car in the long stay car park and wasn’t best pleased at the the circuitous route I had to take.(Be advised,incidentally,that half the car park is now a building site and spaces are very limited.) It’s a bit soulless of course, but otherwise it ticks all the boxes - quiet, comfortable and convenient."
1035,groovychick1958,2018-01-31,5.0,"Overnight stay before flight We stayed at the Hampton at Bristol Airport prior to an early morning flight. Our stay included parking for the time we were away in the long stay car park right outside the terminal and was very competitively priced. The hotel is clean, bright and airy and all the staff we encountered were polite and very helpful. We enjoyed a bar meal and a drink during the evening, although a fairly brief menu all the food was excellent, piping hot and very tasty. We were pleasantly surprised that continental breakfast is open from 4am a bonus we haven’t managed to have at other hotels near airports."
1036,Tromsopete,2018-01-31,3.0,"Jingle bells ... Bright modern reception with a genuine warm welcome at check-in.

Public areas are spacious and comfortable. The rooms are ultra-modern, generous size with a top quality walk-in shower. The beds are very comfortable. Wi-fi is free to all guests with a reasonable signal and speed. Modern flatscreen TV with the British FreeView package. Unfortunately, with many of those channels not working. That is annoying as there is not much else to do here.

Noise insulation room/room, room/corridor and room/outside world very good. However, sadly, that is occasionally spoiled by noisy aircon which comes to life and jingles during the night like Santa’s sleigh. Otherwise, a very good sleep in a very comfortable bed.

I have visited before but only on a day business event. Food was very good back then but sadly, seems to have deteriorated since. Cuisine is only ever going to be basic here but it seemed a real struggle to produce hot, edible sausage and mash.

You cannot beat this place for convenience and comfort. It is the only airport hotel on site, with literally minutes walk to the terminal. Herein lies the problem - a touch of complacency.

I do not expect miracles from a Hampton but there are problems and some slippage here which management should address. Otherwise I would have given top marks. A kitchen which cannot produce bangers & mash would be a good starting point for improvement!"
1037,Love-the-weekends,2018-01-31,5.0,"Great place to stay and fly - does what it says on the tin Stayed here one night prior to an early flight for a long weekend away in Reykjavík. It’s just a couple of minutes’ safe and well lit walk to the terminal building so really ideal. Staff very friendly and happy to pass the time of day. Check in was prompt, informative and cheerful.

Being a limited service hotel, the food options aren’t extensive but we enjoyed the curry of the week which was hot, tasty and just the right amount. 

The room was very well appointed and the bed SUPER comfy, we both awoke fresh, despite the early hour. The bathroom has a great shower, perfect for waking up under at an ungodly hour! Breakfast for early flyers is served continental from 4am with hot items after 6am. There was plenty of choice on the continental with cereals, toast, pastries, porridge pots, fruits, juices and hot drinks - a great start to the day! 

The hotel was clean and well presented and although very busy with a high turnover of people, staff worked quickly to keep the tables clean and clear to keep the bar area nice to stay in.

I did have one little issue while I was there (an honest mistake) which was rectified by Jess on reception who has obviously embraced her training and the Hilton values. Not only this, I had a follow up email from her supervisor just to check that all was ok - great customer service!

I will actively seek to stay here another time if I have an early flight and would urge you to do the same!"
1038,FionaHelene,2018-01-31,4.0,"Clean and comfortable Only there because of a flight problem but very good place to be stuck.
Rooms and beds good as is the WiFi .
Breakfast good but be careful not to miss it as they close the doors promptly.
They gave us a little extra time to check out as flight not until evening.
Staff generally friendly and helpful"
1039,shannons676,2018-01-31,4.0,"Not bad at all I arrived well before check in and they let me check in about 3 hours early (check in is 3pm). Room was clean, modern and warm. It's about a 2 min walk from the terminal so perfect if you have an early flight. I thought the room was really expensive for what it was - the price I paid I really expected a bath or something just a bit flasher. It was still a good room though. Breakfast was included and there were  good continental options (after 6am they start the hot options, my flight was very early so didn't get to try). Overall a clean and modern airport that provides a restful stay before an early flight!"
1040,Exetercitydenise,2017-12-31,5.0,"Short walk to Airport Stayed here before an early morning flight, perfect.  Lovely room, queen double, very comfy bed,  everything very clean, nice bathroom too.  Breakfast also very good.  Continental served from 4 am, very nice with everything you need and a coffee cup so you can take it with you avoiding high airport coffee shop prices!  Cooked breakfast from 6 am but I ad an early flight so can't comment on this element.  Parking expensive but check with reception on pricing when you get there, I understand it's variable, depends on whether you're a hotel guest or just dropping someone off.  Reception staff very smart and very polite and helpful, I would most definitely use again.  Thank you, this was my first visit to this chain, pleasantly surprised bearing in mind other reviews!"
1041,ASB777,2018-01-31,3.0,"Very noisy air con I had expected better from a virtually new Hilton hotel.

It was spotless, very comfortable and had friendly staff.  2 minutes walk to departures partly covered by a walkway.  Wi-fi was free but we couldn`t access it at all during our stay which was a bit annoying.  All in all we would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again."
1044,JerandJoA,2018-01-31,5.0,Perfect Given this hotel 5 out of 5. This is a 3* hotel which is immaculate with good rooms and a decent breakfast particularly for those on the go. Staff were very nice couldn’t fault it for the type of hotel it is. It is a 1 minute walk from the airport.
1045,StephenBarton,2018-01-31,2.0,"Convenient but disappointing  This newish hotel is 5-10 minutes walk from the terminal (but not under cover, so you could get quite wet if it is raining). The external sound-proofing is good, so we were not aware of aircraft noise. The room was a reasonable size, clean and well-designed, with a comfortable bed. And the staff were very pleasant and helpful. However: 1) The sound-proofing within the hotel is not good -we were kept awake by noise from the heating/air-conditioning system, and the plumbing both within our room and from adjoining rooms. 2) The dinner menu is fairly basic - of the pizza and burger variety. 3) The breakfast is 'free' (ie the cost is built into the room rate) and again is a fairly limited buffet. More problematic was that the so-called hot buffet (bacon, sausages, scrambled (but no other) eggs and tomatoes) was in practice barely lukewarm, and was cold before one had chance to eat it all."
1046,morriswoodyman,2017-12-31,5.0,Check your luggage in then go back for a free breakfast. We used this brand new hotel to avoid a night time drive for an early morning flight and were very happy with service and facilities. By booking direct on the hotel's website rather than via the Bristol airport link we got a room and breakfast for 3 people for £75. It's so close to the terminal we were able to check our bags in then go back to the hotel for the cooked breakfast. This saved us at least £30 compared to eating in the airport and more time in bed.
1047,Q4766FAlisap,2018-01-31,2.0,"Disabled accessible rooms It would appear that the Hilton chain of hotels as with most hotels in the U.K. have no consideration when it comes to disabled access. Whenever we book a hotel with disabled facilities our 19 year old daughter is expected to share a bed with us. She is currently staying at Hilton Bristol Airport hotel where her accessible room provides a ""queen"" size bed but no put up or sofa bed for her carer. Having spoken to ""Jason"" a manager who refused to give his surname several times he told me that she should have booked a queen room and paid for another room adjoining. She needs someone in her room to help during the night, but not share her bed. We are living in the dark ages here, talk about discrimination"
1048,kathryn_hurd,2018-01-31,5.0,"Excellent  A perfect place to stay before travel from Bristol Airport, 
Modern,sleek & efficient.
The experience from checking in to checking out we couldn’t fault.
Very friendly helpful staff, the room was perfect, I emailed before we arrived to ask for extra pillows, they were in the room on our arrival.
Comfortable bed, excellent walk in shower.
We had a snack in the bar which we enjoyed and good value.
The breakfast buffet was superb too.
I would recommend this new on airport hotel, Especially if you have an early flight!
Perfect in every way and a good hassle free start to your trip."
1049,kashan83,2018-01-31,5.0,"Perfect! We booked 1 night as our flight got in at 11:30pm.However we were delayed by almost 10 hours so didn’t get to the hotel until 8am of check-out day. As you can imagine we were exhausted and frustrated at our huge delay. We had called to advise the hotel as soon as we found out and they said they’d try to let us have a slightly later check-out. When we arrived this hadn’t been noted and we were ‘no shows’, however the lovely receptionist (Becky) worked some magic which allowed us to check out mid-afternoon, have breakfast and get some much needed sleep before our 2-hour drive home. The room was so nice, we were gutted we couldn’t make full use of it overnight! Thank you, after a night of sitting in an airport and flying at 4am your hotel was a saving grace!!"
1050,oldmandar,2018-01-31,5.0,Overnight stay We had a one night stay in the hotel booked online before arriving. Everything went smoothly hotel and staff were excellent. We had a complimentary continental breakfast hot breakfast not served till 6am.

The room was excellent but again it was new with a nice and comfortable bed,well designed and fitted bathroom and tea/coffee making.Cold when we arrived but a call to reception resulted in heat within a few minutes.(How did they do that?)We faced the runway but no noise could be heard.
One complaint was the bar system. We went and there were two people serving and just 2 customers in front.We had drinks and thought we would order food later as it was early. From the time we sat down and for the next hour there was a queue waiting to be served and at least 6 there.We gave up as not prepared to wait what was at least 10 minutes."
1052,pastie311,2018-01-31,5.0,"Last minute visit  Our plane was delayed arriving into Bristol and, combined with the bad weather, we decided staying at the airport was the best idea.
It was easy to book over the phone and the hotel is on the airport site - two or three minutes from the terminal.
The night reception staff were really efficient and friendly, helpful when we needed extra things and we were in bed in minutes.
Breakfast is provide from 4am to 11am, and was absolutely fine. I’ve always had good experiences at Hampton by Hilton - you need to remember that this is a cheap Hilton Hotel chain - but would definitely recommend for an overnight at the airport."

We checked in at the airport around 4am, went back to the hotel for breastfast at 4.30am, then head back to the airport at 5.15am to catch the flight at 6.30am. That's how near it is. We didn't even bring our bags to check in because we only had carry on bags. Left it at the hotel room and took the bags after breakfast. Price of the room was also affordable. Worth it.

1060,Nerys829,2017-12-31,4.0,Excellent apart from one thing! Had an excellent one night stay before Christmas. Fast check-in and out and very comfortable stay. However there was one problem. The wake up call we ordered for a 6.00am flight never arrived! Luckily we had set our own alarm clock as well. When we told the girl on Reception she said that she had made the call to our room and it had rang a few times but maybe the volume was down! Would not have been happy if we had missed our flight because of this. Surely a wake-up call means you are woken up and you should answer the phone to confirm that you have received this. I have tried to email the hotel to make the Duty Manager aware of this issue but found it impossible to get anywhere with the email system they use from their website.
1061,jojoc25,2017-12-31,1.0,"Last minute booking due to weather  Because of forecasted bad weather and we had an early flight we decided to book this hotel, we normally book the Holiday Inn down the road but being  an honours member thought we would give this hotel a go. 
What a mistake; lovely hotel and staff but the noise in the bedroom from heating or whatever unbearable didn’t sleep a wink!
Something seriously fundamentally wrong with the fan/ air conditioning/ heating system whatever it is making that racket.
I have recorded it and will be playing it back to reception when we check out! 
By the way this was room 8!"
1062,MIfamilyguy,2017-12-31,4.0,"Very nice, just don’t be in a hurry This is a new hotel, (I think it opened 2017,) and just a few minutes walk from the Terminal and car rental area. It has a huge open lobby/bar/restaurant area and fresh, modern décor. My room, while a little small, was comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate. I especially liked the walk-in shower. The bed was comfortable and lighting was very good. (No USB points though.) 

There was quite a lot of noise from the adjoining rooms, and a lot of guests seems to let their kids treat the hallways as a playroom. Not much fun when you have an early flight next day.

I ate in the restaurant, which was okay. Food quality was good but there’s a very limited range to choose from. (And for American visitors, remember to order at the bar. Don’t wait for table service!)

My gripes: when I checked in the receptionist was frankly unfriendly. I felt I was disturbing whatever else she had going on. A simple smile would have made me feel more welcome. And at checkout, well there was only one person serving, very slowly. This is an airport hotel! People have planes to catch and we really don’t want to be waiting in line. So here’s my tip: allow plenty of time to check out."
1063,pb1642,2017-12-31,5.0,"On site hotel at Bristol airport Thinks the second time we have used this hotel. Previous trips had required using hotels off site which was not ideal.  The Hampton is well positioned on site and access to parking and the terminal is an easy walk.  The accommodation is modern, clean and high quality.  The bar and restaurant offers a limited menu but the food is tasty.  Rooms are clean, well proportioned and well sound proofed.  There were sufficient power sockets to allow us to replenish the batteries in all our tech.  Checking in and out is easy, especially with the app.  All in all this was an excellent hotel experience and I would recommend the Hampton to anyone."

Functional clean rooms with good linens, comfortable beds and powerful shower. Plenty of plugs and tea/coffee making facilities. No room safe. Quite a good range of reasonably priced drinks and snacks in the main bar area for dinner. Breakfast at 5.30am was a complete shambles, with both coffee machines not working, they ran out of croissants and no cheese or meats keft(I saw someone finish them off). No serving spoons or napkins either.  Real shame as otherwise we enjoyed our stay here."

The room had some problem with the air conditioning and many times during the night it started to make noises and I had to woke up several times. Later when I spoke with reception the didn't give me a refund or offer me a free nigh or something. 
I read this on Hampton website
Plus, you can count on friendly, helpful service and so much more. Guaranteed. If you're not satisfied, we don't expect you to pay. That's our commitment and your guarantee. That's 100% Hampton®.

The room was small but adequate for our overnight stay with a warm bed and quiet atmosphere. The bed was very comfy too. A buffet breakfast was served from 04:00 which for our 06:00 flight was ideal. There was a good selection and it was all clean. Cooked breakfast from 06:00 which we obviously didn’t try due to time constraints. Price was good and the hotel was better than we expected. The room was air conditioned too.

1081,TremersT,2017-12-31,5.0,Great location. Quiet rooms Great location to airport for our pre & post holiday flights. No aircraft noise in rooms at all. A lift for easier access to the terminal level would be good instead of the steps / very long ramp walk with heavy cases.
1082,Iowkid,2017-11-30,5.0,"Well placed hotel. We stayed in this hotel for the third time this year. A good nights sleep, before flying, with breakfast included.If you park at the far end of the car park it’s easy to reach the hotel and you’re right opposite the airport."
1083,64janeq,2017-11-30,4.0,"Quigley  The Hotel was good, clean and the breakfast good. BUT I was disgusted that we had to pay for the parking (£16.50) for one night. This was a bit of a shock! So beware add this in when comparing prices to other hotels as there might be a better deal close by."
1084,Vanessa186342,2017-11-30,4.0,"Best hotel for bedside reading light Stayed two nights and found hotel very clean, with well thought out room.  Surprisingly quiet considering its nearness to airport.  Excellent breakfast choice.  Food choices outside breakfast not good.

I've stayed in many hotels and found the bedside lamps  inadequate for reading in bed.  This hotel had powerful bedside reading lights which made all the difference.

Only quibbles no provision for toothbrushes or hanging dressing gown in shower room/toilet, and unable to open bedroom window so a bit airless.

Parking is expensive but this seems to be the same throughout Bristol.

I would recommend this hotel for a reasonably priced stay."
1085,38Bella,2017-11-30,4.0,"Perfect location for airport The hotel is new so all clean and shiny.
It’s a few minutes walking distance from the airport and there is a choice of a ramp or steps to get to departures.
Parking is expensive £16.50 per day.
There is a totally unnecessary charge of £1 for a drop off.
If you are paying nigh on £100 per night this should not be charged as extra.
The hotel is very quiet considering the proximity to the runway.
Staff are friendly and efficient but I  think that there should be an offer to take luggage to the rooms.
The hotel is cold!!
The ground floor temperature is acceptable but corridors are distinctly chilly as was my room on arrival. I had to raise the thermostat to 24 degrees to reach an acceptable temperature and this took some time.
I also had to leave the bathroom door open to warm it up in there.
When standing near the window with window and curtains closed there is a cold draft which may  explain why the hotel feels cold.
Having said this, the queen room I booked was very clean and a good size and the bed very comfortable.
Sandwiches made by bar staff were fresh and tasty and the continental breakfast was good except for the lack of decent bread and no bread rolls.
Sliced bread is not enough.
The choice of a cooked breakfast after 6am is great and it looked pretty good.
On the whole I would give the hotel 8/10 but there are details that need sorting out."
1086,Bats24,2017-11-30,5.0,"Last minute gem Our original flight home from Rome was cancelled and the next available one got us into Bristol very late at night. Rather than drive the 2 hour + journey home tired, we chose to stay here for the night.
We’re very glad we did! Check in staff were lovely. Very helpful and friendly. Room was great, spotlessly clean, comfortable with a great shower.
The bar was open all night so we were able to get a nightcap. The decor was inspired, and the breakfast the following morning was wonderful with lots of choice available.
We had some noise all night coming from the bathroom (the extractor fan I think), but being so tired we slept through it eventually.  I understand this is a known issue and is being resolved though.
The location next to the terminal is great, and I will definitely stay here again if we have an early/late flight."

My only regret was that We didn’t take the opportunity to have the complimentary breakfast as our flight was very early. But as it turned out we could have left the hotel a lot later, had breakfast and still walked to the Airport as it’s so close.  I ended up buying breakfast at the airport at an additional cost of £40"
1091,Megan0001,2017-11-30,4.0,Great location ..... BUT very noisy room :  no sleep! We paid around £80  for a room at this hotel it's a short walk across to the airport so it was really convenient. We were allocated room 8 ground floor and I checked with the receptionist to make sure it was definitely a quiet room  as our alarm was set for 4.30 am the next morning. ....the triple glazing was excellent we couldn't hear any outside noise at all .....BUT when we got to bed we could hear a loud clicking noise and whirring which seemed to be coming from the ceiling area above the door  we turned the air con off  but that noise continued all night and by 2.30 am I was so tired and annoyed as we couldn't sleep  I rang reception and explained about the noise-  she said she would  turn off the aircon remotely -(but it wasn't on )  ....the noise continued all night.  When I got to reception around 5 am I explained we couldn't sleep at all due to that noise in our room and I suggested an engineer sort it asap for the next occupiers- we really wasted our money staying here and probably won't stay again.    Another issue but nowhere near as annoying ..... after a very early morning shower we realised there were no bath towels we managed with the 2 small hand towels  and we mentioned this to the receptionist as we checked out at 5.30 am she said .... I've got some here if you want them .  . . .   Maybe we were just  unfortunate with the  room we had.

1093,Lakota75,2017-11-30,3.0,"Lovely hotel, horrendous sleep  My friend and I arrived last night for 1 night, as we were leaving for Glasgow at 7am the next morning.
Alarms were set for 4am.

The rooms are lovely, the restaurant menu is very very basic, with little option, but good food.

The problems happened when I went to bed. (I had a room on the first floor)
Between 10pm and 4am, the room clanked, clunked, whistled and rattled.
I was woken up pretty much every hour between 11pm and 4am due to the noise of what I can only guess what the heating.

I’ve never had such a poor nights sleep at a hotel.

In the morning, I cane down for a continental breakfast (only option at 4:30am, which is fair enough) and my friend said she had exactly the same issue.

When you are staying at an airport hotel with the aim of getting a good nights sleep before a very early flight, you expect to be able to sleep.

Please Hamptons, sort this out. It’s a lovely hotel in a great location, but the noise is horrendous."

However I think they have forgotten that it is the first night of someone's holiday.  It is far from a special meal , food is great but not really a restaurant. Order at bar and sit at one of the tables . If they organised their staff to look after check in , bar and restaurant rather than all doing every everything would definitely improve.

Just a hop and skip over the road to the airport.

Check was quick and the Staff very polite and helpful. 
We had breakfast which was continental as we left early. It was very good and there was a lot of choice. 
I would definitely return here if I was taking another early flight from Bristol and it was a good deal with the airport car parking included."

Reception was quick and the bar reasonably priced for where it was. Food was good and the 24/7 food was brilliant as I took a pizza up to the room.
Didn't want to give a 5 but thought that 4 was too low."

The hotel is new, clean, modern and the staff polite. After reading poor reviews about the food, we decided to eat locally at the George, Backwell. This was a positive decision, with a lovely meal. However, the breakfast at the hotel was delicious. As I said, we didn’t eat dinner here but I think the menu could do with an overhaul, but again, this is an airport hotel and a Michelin Star meal would be out of place!!! 

Our room was light and modern. The walk-in shower was powerful and warm, and we had a very comfortable stay which has set the scene for a relaxing holiday. 

Thanks for getting us off to a great start."
1105,lindahE4048LD,2017-11-30,5.0,Pre holiday stay Our overnight stay at the Hilton was excellent value for money. It minimised the potential stress and worry of early morning adverse weather conditions or motorway disruptions. It was a very short walk from hotel to the airport arrivals.
1106,529Anne,2017-10-31,1.0,"Dreadful  We stayed one night at the Hampton. My husband enquired earlier in the week did the hotel have a car park. No mention of a charge. On arrival we were informed it would cost us £16.50 for overnight parking  !! Reception staff staff were less than helpful and told us it was not their problem. When we queried the high cos.   We then found the dinner menu was practically non existent so we were forced to leave the hotel and the carpark which cost us a further £8 !!!! To search for a restaurant. Which we did which had a free car park and is a hotel. A mile from the airport. We will stay there in future.
There many other disappointments in the hotel room so would not recommend a stay there."
1107,SarahJR83,2017-10-31,4.0,"Great airport hotel We stayed here before an early morning flight and couldn’t have hoped for anything more. We had a family room which had the sofa bed already made up for our daughter. Room was lovely and clean with a lovely bathroom. It was a bit on the small side with the sofa bed out but for one night it was fine. Tea/coffee provided. No decaf coffee though which I would have liked. 
Only negative was the air con (presumably) which was off made a loud noise a couple of times in the night which was enough to wake me up. 

We had a meal in the bar which was lovely - daughter had a tuna sandwich, husband had the burger and chips which he absolutely loved, and I had a tomato and mozzarella salad with a bowl of chips. Prices were reasonable for a hotel and they had lots of snacks and essentials to buy if you needed it. 
I can’t comment on breakfast as we left the hotel at 5 for the 5minute walk to the airport, but continental was available at that time.

I booked the hotel in combination with airport parking which I felt was very reasonable. 
Wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again if we had an early flight."
1108,ShaneMcGuinny,2017-11-30,3.0,"Good hotel - terrible caesar salad  Nice hotel located 5 minutes walk from the airport. Friendly engaging staff, new clean rooms, and good breakfast.

Packed full of a tasteless and rubbery cheese and covered in a sauce that at best could be described as bland. I would stay in the hotel again and avoid the salad."
1109,spainkt,2017-10-31,3.0,"Great comfortable rooms, but food disappointing  Stayed second time here, due to flight times, and the room and access to departures is brilliant, although it is quite a steep walk if you are trailing a heavy suitcase ! However, there is a free bus you can get from close to the hotel that will drop you off at departures. Rooms are well equipped and very comfortable, bathroom great too. All very clean. The noise from the air conditioning though frightened me to death, I thought someone was trying to break into the room ! Only disappointment was the choice of food in the bar, to me this was very poor, I don’t normally have a bowl of chips as my main meal, but there was nothing that I wanted. Even the choice of (3) different sandwiches was poor. Will stay again for an early flight just for the convenience and the cleanliness, will just bring something with me to eat ! One hint - you get 1 hr free parking at the hotel which means you don’t have to drag your luggage across the car park, plenty of time to check in and make a drink after a long journey!"

Myself and my son was travelling to Cardiff to watch boxing. He is the wheelchair user everyday!. I booked a queen size with mobility Access! I think if I'm being honest the guy who checked me in saw I didn't have a wheelchair and stuck is in a normal  room with minimal access!  Bathroom not accesible like the pictures feel disappointed that such a hotel brand can make serious mistakes like this! I didn't have time to make a fuss as we where on a strict time scale watching a major event! To come back to find a small double room if that wheelchair had to drive to the furthest room on 1st floor( no idea why, glad there wasn't a fire?) All.in all if you are a disabled user I wouldn't recommend staying at this place! Same old same old story I'll add some pictures of laughable queen size room and the accesible bathroom! If you wish to take the time to see the pictures on there website there nothing like what is in reality very very disappointed overall would never stay again disabled travellers beware please don't get caught short! By what I can only describe as poor poor customer service as I don't have the wheelchair present at check In!

I thought parking was in the airport long stay but the hotel does have its own car park. It can be quite a hike from the long stay so even though the Hampton parking is expensive, the convenience might make it worthwhile.

Nice touch having breakfast starting at 4:00.

This is where I would stay again if travelling from Bristol Airport."
1114,gwynnie2001,2017-10-31,2.0,"Conveniently placed hotel close to airport. On arrival outside the terminal building (by bus) there was no signage to say how to approach the hotel although the building could be seen.  This resulted in a trek in the rain across several car parks and roads. However, my departure was simple out the rear of the hotel through a covered walk way and then up the steps/ramp from the short stay car park. The hotel is new and fresh and the room was comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was included in the room price and one of the reasons for booking the room was the promise of a continental breakfast starting at 4 am which fitted with the early check ins for EasyJet flights.  On entering the breakfast area at 4, there was no sign of any breakfast just many people waiting around so I went to the airport for coffee and croissants with security and check in completed. One thing I must mention is the Caesar salad I ordered from the bar shortly after arrival.  It consisted of a bowl with a thick layer of croutons on the bottom, some shredded lettuce on top and then some grated cheese.  On top of this were strips of tasteless chicken with the texture of rubber so I definitely cannot recommend the food! Still for me being on site and so close to the terminal building was the biggest bonus of this hotel.  I can certainly recommend it for sleep comfort but not for the food."
1115,Ziggyblue,2017-10-31,3.0,"Food Needs attention My second visit this year.  Room good although disappointing that I couldn’t open bedroom window, very stuffy.

The food in the evening was appalling. Beefburger was so over cooked and dry I could have used it to patch my shoe. Chips were either cooked in old oil or had been cooked previously and refried. When I spoke to the waitress she said what do you want me to do about it, they are all the same!  She then said she would ask her supervisor to come over.  He or she couldn’t be bothered.  Compare this to the food at the Holiday Inn, Bristol Airport and very much lacking.

However the continental breakfast at 4am was a big improvement on my last visit. Excellent choice all fresh and far superior to the evening menu."
1116,fivedeltadelta,2017-10-31,3.0,"Not the best night's sleep. I booked this place at £109 on the basis of good reviews. Room 166 was fresh and clean and bedding all good. My first problem was the noise from AC or plumbing in the roofspace outside the toilet door. I thought of asking to be moved but at 1130pm, I couldn't be bothered. I regret that. During the night I discovered that the worst noise would come from vehicles...buses I think idling on an exit ramp outside. The hotel room was well-insulated for sound, but somehow the rumble penetrates to shake the bed. 

None of this was the fault of the very pleasant hotel staff, but whatever short-sighted crew thought it a good idea to put bedrooms so close to a road. 

I'd  consider staying here again, but only if I could get a room on a quiet side of the hotel.

The receptionist did waive my charge for a glass of beer when I reported the noise, but £109 for a disturbed sleep is still about £109 too much."

1125,37nialll,2017-10-31,4.0,"Check-in helpful in getting better price. accommodation great, some disorganization Accomodation is great for what this airport is for - an airport layover.  I booked on booking.com but the hotel had no record of the booking - and I overheard the exact same thing happening to the next person checking in.  Luckily they had accommodation and they recommended one room rather than two for our overnight accommodation for my wife, two children (one teenager) and myself.  Free breakfast (a substantial all-you-can-eat with classic cooked breakfast stuff), and free wifi.  All for £139 which is good for 4 people.

Dinner menu is very limited, but food was fine, and reasonably priced.  On 1st night, I received a free dinner - here's why:  At 8pm, I ordered a salmon for myself and a burger for my son, along with two waters. Waitress came to table at 8:35 pm to explain they did no have salmon.  I was surprised to say the least - at that point a salmon should be cooked an served. But in fairness, the waitress gave me a free burger instead. Food and drinks arrived together, at 8 53pm.
On the second night, all four of us ate there.  I was thinking the dinner might take a long time again to serve, so we ordered well ahead of when we needed to eat.  But it all came out within 10 mins (perfect).

Anyway, fine place to stay.  Perhaps they are having teething with some organisation things (the place looks new).  Friendly staff too."

The room itself was very comfortable.  We popped down to the reception for some food, very basic menu so we decided on chips, they came out very quickly but I'm guessing they were triple cooked as they tasted very greasy.

1132,Kelbel974,2017-09-30,4.0,"Great night sleep!  Stayed the night here before an early morning flight. 
The check in lady was very friendly and helpful when we arrived late evening. 
Our room was really clean and comfortable, with a nice bathroom. 
We had a drink and a burger in the restaurant. They don’t have a huge selection of food on the menu, but it was ok. 
We slept amazingly well, I woke up refreshed at 4am! I have never had a good sleep at an airport hotel before. The bed was so comfortable and the room was nice and quiet. We will definitely stay here if we fly from Bristol again."
1133,Bee5912,2017-09-30,4.0,"22nd September - One night stay Came here on Friday 22nd September 2017. 
Me and my boyfriend stayed here for one night due to our early flight to Mexico. £99 for 2 people including a breakfast of continental and full English buffet. 

We were in room one on the ground floor. This was very easy and quick to get too and right opposite the gym which was very handy for me, 

The whole place including the room was very clean and decorated lovely. The staff were also very nice and helpful. We had our evening meal here too which was very large and good value for money. The breakfast was also very good. 

I did find the room very cold though :( 

Easy and quick access to the airport which was VERY handy!"
1134,PK61,2017-10-31,4.0,"Ideal place if you have an early flight...... Everything you would expect from a Hampton. Clean, business like rooms with everything you would need for an overnight stay. Expensive car park so we had already purchased car parking in the airport long stay car park. On arrival they had a single receptionist working front of house so it delayed check -in. They serve a continental breakfast from 4am which was perfectly fine however there is no restaurant at this hotel and you take your food back into the bar / reception area to eat. We did not see it busy as we left shortly after 4am however I suspect it could get a little crowded when the hotel is full."
1135,MontyBob17,2017-10-31,4.0,"Holiday begins Stayed the night before our flight as it was an early morning flight, hotel in an ideal location to Bristol airport 3 minutes and you are at departures, rooms were comfortable and very clean would definately stay again. Thank you"
1136,blackbirdclara,2017-10-31,4.0,"Very Good It's new, its clean and does what it should ie provide a great stop-over pre or post holiday. The walk to the airport is probably 100 metres. Bar and restaurant area were standard but good and breakfast very good. I will certainly stay again. A word of warning, I arrived in my car which I'd pre-booked into long stay car park. I entered Hilton via barrier to drop off bags and exited Hilton before entering main car park to park car. On collection of car post holiday the exit barrier didn't open and I had to go the the staff attendant to sort out. I was not alone, it appears that if you have pre-booked and enter Hilton barriers first, your Hiltonexit cancels out the long stay booking as they are on the same system. They resolved it quickly but seems to be something they need to address."
1137,andmarCornwall_,2017-09-30,3.0,"Good - apart from the restaurant! Typical 'business' style airport hotel. New in 2017 (?), spotless, clean, good standard rooms which are fine, and which are very quiet. You would not know you were at an airport. Location is 5 minutes from the departure building - so really good if you have an early flight.

So all good. But for heavens sake why the dreadful food? The food 'eating area' (its not a restaurant) is downstairs - order at the bar. Its a canteen approach. And our offering was burger, pizza or curry. We had the burger at @ £11 - frozen & really bad.  So for 2 with a glass of wine each it was over £30!

We do not want a gourmet meal, but this It would stop us returning. Why not more choice & a less canteen like dining option?"
1138,Retired_Traveller12,2017-10-31,4.0,"Health & Safety We only spent a few hours in this hotel as we had to catch a very early flight.
We were allocated room 4 which is on the ground floor.
The room was very comfortable with all the usual extras expected of such a hotel.
However, our sleep was interrupted several times by what we think was the extractor fan from the bathroom in room 3. This was almost a severe vibration in the wall, and as we were looking forward to a good night's sleep due to the early rise, it was very annoying.
I also noticed that the emergency cord in the bathroom, which is supposed to be free of obstruction and almost touching the floor (to enable a collapsed person to reach it), was in fact tied up around towel/radiator bars, and was about 2 feet above the floor - well out of the reach of any collapsed person. I untied this, but I am sure that it would be tied up again quite soon, as cleaning staff find it tends to get in their way. But their annoyance should be secondary to the Health & Safety of guests.
Otherwise, the hotel was very good, and if the neighbourly vibrations could be eliminated then I would recommend others to stay there. But until then - only book if you intend getting to sleep after your neighbours get to bed"
1139,GlennAndrews,2017-07-31,4.0,"great hotel great location had a nice stop here, nice room plenty of car parking and pleasant staff. Location is ideal for the airport, food is great bar and restaurant are also great . Yes i would definitely stay here again if i am in the area"
1140,thomastravelsworld,2017-10-31,4.0,"Perfect for what we wanted Stayed overnight before catching a very early flight out of Bristol airport the following day. Reception is nice and very business like. Big spacious and plenty of charging points for all technology gear, providing you have your leads.
Room was simple but we heard a few noises from the people above especially when they were having a shower with the drainage making a funny sound. But we heard nothing from the planes all night and got a good few hours sleep. The breakfast was a bonus with the coffee and pastries being nice. Could not comment on the cooked breakfast as left at 4:30am where the walk to the terminal was lit up automatically when we approached it."
1141,IAmBigJim,2017-10-31,4.0,"Over night stay Stayed at location due to attending a do locally. 
The hotel very well presented and clean, greeted by reception staff who were all full of smiles. Due to me being in wheel chair didn’t make me fill awkward or out of place. 
Given an easy accessible room on the ground floor.
The room was very clean and well presented with tea and coffee making facilities.
Being that this hotels based within the grounds of Bristol International Airport thought there may have been a issue with noise, but no I was wrong slept very peacefully. 
Snacks are available at location both of us had beef burger and chips very nice hit the spot.
Awoke went through for full English breakfast although the variety was there should you require anything different.
Car parking at location is good but at a premium £16.50 for one night. 
If anything could not fault location or staff, although one niggle was a guest/hanger on at the reception bar location who was constant try to obtain cigarettes from guest. At first didn’t mind but on return he was still there and still trying to obtain cigarettes. Whether it’s because they don’t sale cigarettes or he just wanted to test people he did on a few occasions offer to buy one. Hopefully this was a one off."
1142,Startrekers,2017-09-30,3.0,"Missing a trick This was my second stay here to catch an early morning flight, 
Pros. Location
Cons. Double the cost of the premier inn.
           Poor food choice, burger or salmon.
           Reception, bar and restaurant are the same area.
           No atmosphere"
1143,167gillianw,2017-09-30,4.0,"Very convenient for airport Stayed here for one night as we had an early flight out, and the best part of this hotel is the convenience to the airport, just a short walk to the terminal. 
The hotel itself is very new and modern and also very clean and comfortable. The staff are all very pleasant and helpful.
The breakfast needs some improvements, not much to choose from before 6 am, but all in all i would stay here again if travelling out of Bristol."
1144,RobertMac2017,2017-09-30,4.0,"Great location for Airport Great place for access to airport especially if you have a early morning flight, you can
walk straight out of hotel into Airport departures. However the air conditioning was very noisy and we had to contact reception to turn it off, not good if you have a early morning 
flight and just want to sleep. Was disappointed that at 4 am there is no cook food available for breakfast just the basics cook food is only available from 6 am. overall very much like a travelodge  hotel at twice the expense, however worth staying if you want easy access to departures."
1145,James0630,2017-09-30,5.0,"Ideal for an early flight out I picked this hotel based on location mostly.  It is located near the car parking area and just a few minutes walk to the Terminal. 
Things that I liked:
1. Convenient location, right at airport, 3 min walk.
2. Early breakfast, starts at 4am.  Great for my 6:20am departure time (check in at 5am).
3. Room was very clean and was a decent size for this country.
4. Room was very quiet.
5. Reasonable price.
6. Check-in staff was friendly and polite.
Things I didn't like:
1. Food quality was so-so.
Overall, I recommend this hotel and I would choose it again."
1146,elenasandrah,2017-10-31,4.0,good experience I reccomend this hotel to everyone but also for disabled persons. The stuff is very kind and they helped with things I needed. If you need bus from the hotel to the airport they can provide you and it is free.
1147,bethi,2017-09-30,3.0,"Great rooms, motor way services style restaurant/lounge. We stayed in this hotel for one night prior to a holiday. 

Check in was a bit slow but was friendly and the manager explained a little about the hotel i.e. that it was constructed from old ship 'containers'. So when we were shown to our room we weren't expecting it to be as lovely as it was .... it was small but very comfortable with a delightful walk in shower and a lovely bed. We were supplied with extra pillows on request. It overlooked the airport but we were not troubled by any noise. 

We had three disappointments the first was in the public areas; lounge, restaurant etc. There was nowhere comfortable to sit and relax with a pre-dinner drink except for a very few lounge chairs (all occupied) beside the front entrance. Everything else was a bit like a motorway services, modern, sparse and a bit chilly with a too enthusiastic use of air-conditioning. 

The second disappointment was with the food; there was nothing on the menu that was attractive to us and what we did order was just about OK but certainly not to the standard that we expected. What a shame; anyone going on holiday is in a good mood and ready to celebrate the start of the event. It would have been nice to have the choice of something a bit more up-market by way of food and venue. 

The third problem was that it is quite a long uphill walk to the actual airport. We are not young and we had 2 suitcases each so it was a bit of a struggle. Also had it been raining (and we were going to a hot dry country so had no waterproofs with us) it could have been disastrous. I think a covered level walkway accessed from roof level and accessible by lift is essential. This difficulty of access means that it is unlikely we will return to the Hampton by Hilton at Bristol because it is easier to stay at a more distant hotel with a shuttle service to the airport doors. 

I think for anyone who wants low prices and doesn't mind fast food and a longish walk to the airport the hotel is a good choice as the rooms are very good but for oldies like us I believe there are better options. 

The hotel is very new so perhaps things will improve."
1148,AlistairS505,2017-09-30,3.0,"Handy for airport The hotel is ideally situated being just 3 minutes walk away from the airport. The room was very comfortable, the room was chilly when we entered but I simply adjusted the air conditioning unit (which in our room was not noisy).  I was disappointed in the meals available in the evening and the seating in the lounge/bar area was not that comfortable. We found that the buffet breakfast was fine and well replenished"
1149,CornishHoney,2017-09-30,2.0,"Noisy air conditioning Two rooms were booked  on the 2nd floor and their air conditioning was appallingly noisy.  The system rattled (I thought someone was at my door) and then made a loud click before starting to roar.  At 10.45, having just settled to sleep it started up and roared for 15 minutes.  I was desperate and had just decided to get up, dress, and go down to reception when it stopped.  The same thing woke me several times in the night.

I made a strong complaint to the reception desk when I checked out and was just told “You should have rung down and asked for a change of room” hardly a practical suggestion to dress, repack, and move!!

I will never stay at this hotel again, nor recommend it, even though it so convenient for the airport."
1150,vikkibryant,2017-09-30,2.0,"Poor This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel when using Bristol airport. 
The hotel is modern, clean and tidy. 
First stay was ok, although we found it strange that they would situate a restaurant in the lobby area. Second stay has been awful. We arrived and were allocated our room. As we entered our room we noticed shoes and a bag on the floor..........yes we had just been given access to another guests room. We immediately went down to reception and explained what had happened and were told ‘the computer shouldn’t let them do that’. I understand computer glitches happen therefore we let that go. We went down to eat and although the menu only seems to have around four options we decided to have salmon. Well......the salmon was awful, It was hard and the beans were undercooked and cold. I explained this to the restaurant manager who within 10 minutes had arranged a replacement meal so again I let this go. Finally after our ‘meal’ we went to our room as we had an early flight to catch and as we went to enter our room the key would not work. After my husband went back down to reception they advised him that he had been ‘checked out’. At this point we had had enough. Never will I stay at this shambles of a hotel again. It is by far the worst. I would recommend the holiday inn if you would like to stay near the airport."
1151,StuartD1586,2017-09-30,1.0,"Bring your own breakfast! Don't stay here if you have an early morning flight as they do not start to serve breakfast until after the time of the first check in, nor is a packed one available which would be an acceptable alternative"

Easy access from Bristol temple meads station there is a regularly bus service close to the hotel  for those travelling by train.  There is also parking for those travelling by car. The only disappointment was that the hotel does not have a proper restaurant. There is a bar and a very limited choice ( 5 or 6 choices} of bar meals in the evenings just burgers and chips that sort of thing. There is a good choice  at breakfast if you have time .

The location is ideal if you are flying from or to Bristol airport."

Evening meal really good and not expensive; wonderful to be able to have breakfast early in the morning, and to be able to take with us what we couldn't eat there."
1156,219jillw,2017-09-30,2.0,"Convenient for airport but they are overpriced for single travellers. Awful breakfast. For couples, the price is expensive but not overly but Hilton seem to be penalising single travellers by not having a single rate and not even having single rooms available. This puts up the price to businesses who are sending staff abroad too.
The room was fine but there was a constant noise from the water supply in the bathroom and it was impossible to sleep because the a/c was coming on and going off all the time and was noisy too (cheap unit I expect). I turned it off but it might be a problem in the summer.
Evening meal - little choice and not that nice. I was overcharged for my drink. 
Breakfast - is free but you certainly would know it. It was just like going to a cheap hotel 20 years ago; scrambled eggs which tasted like they were made from a powdered egg, dry bacon, everything only luke warm. If I had been paying £40 a night I might not have minded but £98 for a single person is a joke quite frankly."

Rooms were great, clean and comfy.
Best feature of the hotel was the staff.  They were so helpful and one member in particular couldnt do enough for us. Her name was Lilla(hope i'm allowed to mention her name). She was so helpful from helping us to book a hotel   for our 2nd night to helping me access my suitcase after i'd lost padlock keys! 
Well done hilton! Would recommend"

This is my first bad review!"
1159,trevannhobbs,2017-09-30,4.0,How to get soaked at Bristol Airport!!! Very satisfactory providing it isnt raining and you dont have to leave a car outside the hotel for long as parking is extortionate. The evening menu is very disapponting but the complementary breakfast is adequate.
1160,karengshropshire,2017-09-30,4.0,"Good for a stopover!  Stayed here for one night to break up the trip down to Cornwall! Felt slightly strange as most people seemed to be going on holiday!
Right next to the airport but we didn't hear a single noise from the planes all of the time we were there!
Check in good, we were early but they still had a room available. Staff were friendly and advised us where or more importantly where not to go to eat! In the end we stayed at the hotel, dinner was fine and prices reasonable. Breakfast next day was very good with a decent choice, we enjoyed it! 
Hotel is typical Hampton, you know what you're going to get and this one didn't disappoint. Lovely clean room, good air con, comfy beds and a good bathroom.
Only issue for us was that we felt a bit stuck there as we didn't want to drive out again and were warned how expensive taxi's are so we decided to stay put. Parking, while right outside and plentiful was an extortionate £16. I believe it's owned and managed by the airport but surely Hampton could have negotiated a better deal???"

The room is adequate,Travlelodge standard.
Clearly despite being open for 6 months they are still having teething problems with the logistics of accommodating & catering for  their footfall.However-at £75 for the night can't complain.A good breakfast selection available from early doors.So,would stay again on balance."

1167,AmmaarUK,2017-09-30,4.0,"Major change of staff!! Hi everyone,

I've stayed at this hotel a few times before a flight the following day

It's okay for a transit stop, food and drinks available by the most unwelcoming staff I've ever seen in my whole life, experienced on a few occasions 

Don't get me wrong people the foreign staff from overseas have always been 10/10! men and women, and male uk staff! but the local UK women were the most unfriendliest ever!! When I stayed there last week one of the local reception/bar staff were literally arguing in front of my face when I was trying to get checked in...and then gossiping to other staff how the other ones not working and sitting around bla bla in front of my face when I was at the bar

Check out this morning again by an overseas young lady, pleasant and sweet whereas local girls chatting away at Main reception and discussing personal circumstances with the most disgusting fed up looks, no smiles nothing 

I've got names but would save them for now but clear up your act girls, if you don't like your job and can't show respect towards clients then do something else, the managers need to look into this.

Otherwise rooms nice and clean, food basic, good for stopover."

The following day after spending time in Bristol city we returned to the hotel to collect our bags and head to the airport. After an airport 'night mare' we were forced to spend another night at the Hampton. The staff were fantastic and even assisted us to book another on line flight and print tickets etc. The usual check out time is 11.00.

She and Dwain could not have been more helpful: Dwain even found an extra cushion to help me sleep. At 5.15, as early travelers left, Iandra found us a room for a few hours. What bliss.

Our room was lovely with everything we needed and cleaned to a very high standard. The breakfast was lovely and check out was easy and quick. I would love to rate 5* but in our room some kind of water or a boiler would kick in nearly every half hour/hour which woke us up followed by a bang, we tried to figure out what it was but being so tired we just wanted to sleep, maybe it's the pipes in the wall or the air con? 
This won't stop us from staying again but we may stay clear of that room.

One hour feee parking to drop bags off and then park your car in long stay which is directly opposite. You can walk back to the hotel and not have to wait for the shuttle bus. Booking. Hotel and car park separately is the cheapest option. Hotel still has the 'new carpet smell'. Breakfast from 4 am is great (continental until 7 am). Only downside of the stay is the often reported long wait for evening food. Good when arrived but an hour wait. Overall a really good stay but so t eating the evening if you are on a tight schedule."

I arrived at 2am for a flight at 6 *sigh* and upon check in, the staff where polite and efficient in getting everything sorted quickly.  

The hotel lobby is clean and modern and the room does what it needs, mine was clean and light.  

I did not use the restaurant / bar which would have been interesting as this is where the hotel seems to have let itself down.

For reference, the hotel is about 2 minutes from the airport entrance (walking). 

Overall, I have no faults here. I received an on time wake up call and enjoyed a short but enjoyable stay."
1181,Cornishbruce,2017-08-31,3.0,"Could be better Comfortable rooms and convenient for the airport, especially if you have an early flight or a late arrival. We had an early flight and arrived at the hotel late afternoon. Strangely it does not have a ‘proper’ restaurant, this may be alright in a city centre but in the isolation of Bristol Airport there is very little alternative to the limited and expensive bar snacks. Compared to hotels at other airports we found this one on the expensive side and the public areas very functional and clinical. OK for one night. You can leave your car at the hotel but at an extortionate price but you can park for one hour free which is handy to drop of bags then go and park somewhere cheaper like Silverline."
1182,acmemc,2017-07-31,4.0,Value for Money We were passing Bristol & broke journey for the night here. The reception staff were very courteous. The room was large very clean & cozy. Wash room was spacious too. The morning breakfast spread was very good. Food very good & quality too. Good place

Spotless room, lovely linen, comfy bed. Great shower.  Really good selection at breakfast.

Airport parking pricy but that's not the hotel's fault as run separately. You can pay for the parking at the hotel which is convenient.

Looking forward to returning very soon!"

They serve breakfast from 4AM, which is a good service. The breakfast is nothing special but will do the job for most of the travelers. 
3 minutes walk to the terminal."
1187,W799LCpatriciar,2017-08-31,5.0,"Comfortable stay! What a nice & comfortable hotel. So nice and clean. The bed was so comfortable and the Egyptian cotton sheets were a nice touch. We stayed here as we're flying out early and it made all the difference.

We had an evening meal of burger & chips and chicken korma. It was good and sufficient. 

Would highly recommend if you have a very early flight from Bristol Airport. It's less than a five minute walk to airport. They serve a breakfast buffet at 6am or they can do you a breakfast package to take away."
1188,C3996TUmarkb,2017-09-30,1.0,"Please do not bother with this hotel it is awful. This hotel thinks it will get customers falling over themselves to book simply because it is on the airport grounds. It does not excuse poor facilities, bed and customer service. Do not rely on a wake up call- if I had not used a back-up I would have missed my flight. Avoid at all costs!!"
1189,931sallyw,2017-08-31,5.0,Ideal for early Bristol Airport departures This hotel is ideal for early departures from Bristol Airport as Continental breakfast is served from 4.00 am and it is only a 5 - 10 minute walk to the check in desks. We used the Bristol Flyer bus transfer from Temple Meads Station and it was a short walk from the drop off point at the airport. Food is served in the bar area so we could have a meal on our arrival at around 8.00 pm. The hotel was very comfortable and made it a lovely start to our holiday. Would certainly use it on future trips.
1190,DavidHCP,2017-08-31,5.0,"Pre flight overnight stay It's only a short walk from the terminal to the hotel so it's location can't be faulted. 
Our room was very clean and fresh with a very good ""office"" chair plus a comfortable chair with a footstool. 
The evening menus is simple and breakfast offers a wide choice of items. 
All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful, a reflection of care when selecting them and the level of training given."
1191,Travelquay,2017-09-30,2.0,"Waiting.......... First the good news, walking distance to the terminal and decent rooms for an overnight stay.
And then there is the food, first you have to get in a queue at the bar to give your order and then wait while the staff serve drinks and eventually take your order.
Then you wait and wait and..........two hours later your very sub standard food arrives, I think my burger was an ice hockey puck in a previous life! We felt sorry for the staff who spent so much time apologising to everybody.
Then, rather later than hoped, we got to bed and tried to sleep but some infernal motor droning away kept us waiting to get to sleep.........."

1194,stevemU3261MA,2017-08-31,5.0,You won't beat this This new hotel is 3min walk from the terminal. For a reasonable price for business rate under £100 including continental breakfast it is good value. I've used this airport for many years and the local hotels are dated and a short drive away. This is a good modern facility on the airport which was badly needed for those early flights.
1195,976amys,2017-08-31,5.0,"Great hotel for airport We stayed at the Hampton by Hilton before our early flight the next day. Had a great rate through expedia. Lots of reviews compared to a Hilton. This is a Hampton by Hilton so don't compare to this hotel to Hilton standards. 

The hotel is new and very clean.. rooms are spacious and bathrooms modern. All the staff were polite and helpful even at 3.45 in the morning when we left. Breakfast is available from 4am we didn't make use of this as we needed to leave just before. Walking distance to the terminal and like others have said it's cheaper to book the car into airport parking for an extra night than paying for a nights parking at the hotel. We found it cheaper to book Bristol airport parking and the hotel separate. The deal on Bristol airport for parking and hotel together worked out more expensive. 

The restaurant is an open space- we didn't eat at the hotel but seemed a good choice. The toiletries in the bathroom were good. 

A great hotel, great price and great for early Bristol flights. 

Would use again in the future!"
1196,MartinH208,2017-06-30,5.0,"your holiday starts right here For an overnight stay before a flight, book the car in at a separate parking facility as the rates here are, to be honest, unreasonable. My previous visit featured amazingly friendly staff - yes, every one of them - a perfectly comfortable room with every expected facility, a good dining room for an affordable evening meal and a first-rate (inclusive) breakfast. And only a couple of minutes' walk into the terminal. One of the best airport experiences in Britain."

We stayed here for one night before travelling, the staff are really friendly here, greeting you whenever they pass and always happy to help with anything. The hotel is very modern and smart looking, the rooms are really nice and comfy. The first hour of parking is free if you want to drop stuff off then head back out. There are lots of parking spaces too, so should be no problems parking. The breakfast buffet is free and there is a large seating area, it's also nice and quiet yet the food is very high quality, a huge variety of different breakfast items and set us up for the day. This is literally a 2 minute walk to the actual airport so a perfect location. The only one thing that was a bit frustrating was how noisy the air con was - very noisy, however would not put us off staying again, we are definitely looking forward to returning here."
1200,Davidincognac,2017-08-31,4.0,"Room and food The hotel is brilliantly located for the airport and as you would expect of a high standard chain. Our food  was of average quality overall. The worse thing was the hour wait, we were told ten minutes. A number of people had the same problem but the Hilton did refund us. I would stay again"
1201,Janetuprop,2017-08-31,4.0,"Fabulous contemporary ambience Wonderful facility to have at the airport. This is definitely the place to go for pre-flight, post-flight drinks and food, business meetings and a comfortable night before an early flight. 

Unfortunately I believe some of the young staff to be in need of some further training. When approaching the reception area to ask for some food, I was advised that the young lady had not yet started her shift yet despite being in her uniform and chatting with other staff!

She was also drinking from a personal plastic drink bottle behind the counter which was far from professional. 

When food arrived there were no instructions given as to where we could find condiments, Napkins etc.  

Another member of staff was carrying food to another table and asked what food we were waiting for as they weren't sure whose food was waiting at the service point, which was worrying and also unprofessional as it was far from busy. 

Once we had eaten, one of the staff cleared one plate from the table whilst other members was still eating which is not what I would expect. 

One other point just to mention generally is that the hair of one of the girls was most untidy, hanging down from a pony tail and not looking smart at all. I appreciate that this hotel has yet to become busy and it certainly wasn't busy when we were there, but the level of professionalism and service needs to be upheld at all times and a work environment maintained . 

I hope that this constructive observation will assist with building what undoubtedly has the potential to be, a very popular stop off when visiting the airport or arranging business meetings. 

Looking forward to visiting again when next I fly from Bristol Airport!"
1202,vvalentine888,2017-08-31,5.0,Flying trip Fabulous place. No complaints except they forgot our wake up call for the plane! Very clean and staff super helpful. The room was lovely.

1204,196rayk,2017-08-31,4.0,Over night stay for early flight Very comfy and attentive staff . The only disappointment was the quality of the bar menu and not fresh ingredients the beef burger was cheap and nasty Macdonald is better as that is desperation. Apart from that really nice
1205,Clarelm79,2017-08-31,3.0,Nice but not cheap Nice hotel what you would expect from a Hilton hotel.  Rooms lovely and clean.  Staff friendly and welcoming.  To pay extra for parking is a total rip off!!! Breakfast ok hot option could do with being worked on!
1206,chelra02,2017-08-31,2.0,"Clean but shame about the food and noise! Staff are friendly, hotel bright and clean, nicely equipped rooms (great hair dryer).
However - the restaurant is dreadful, very limited menu (they're missing a trick here as there's no choice of eating venue at the airport) and decor is geared towards appearance rather than functionality. There are huge light shades which aren't lined up with the tables and hang very low, so although none of my party were over 5ft 5 we all hit our heads on them. The food is served on fancy wooden boards so slippery that my chips slid off onto the table and had to be replaced. Then we had to send back two chicken burgers which were raw in the middle and the replacements took over 40 minutes to arrive. Prices at the bar were extortionate. 
Once in our rooms all four of us discovered that the extractor fans in the rooms randomly switch themselves on periodically through the night - sounding like a freight train coming through the room. Hardly got any sleep!
To finish it off, car park prices were astronomical, it would probably have been cheaper to park in the airport car park. 
Definitely not an experience I wish to repeat any time soon."

Decent but short bar menu for lunch or dinner and portions were huge. They also do cocktails but held off due to early start! Room was comfortable, had iron, hair dryer, toiletries etc.  The room was very quiet considering it is minutes from the terminal..staff were very friendly and helpful. There is free wi-fi .

Good hotel as far as airports go. Clean and spacious public areas. Snacks were OK and good range of drinks.
Bedroom was just about big enough - very compact, but in a good condition as expected with a new hotel.
Unfortunately, my wife locked herself in the bathroom, which required an intervention and rescue by hotel staff, who were very helpful. Not the first time this has happened, apparently...

1217,1paulvj,2017-08-31,1.0,"Aweful food after long wait.  We had read peoples comments that it could take up to an hour to get served food here, so we looked for somewhere else to eat but didn't fancy the Bungalow Family Fun Pub close by so decided to give it a try. 
We ordered a Caprese salad and mains of Salmon fillet potatoes and green beans.  
The salad arrived quickly and we were fooled into thinking that the hotel had remedied the slow service many had reported. 45 mins after our order had been placed left us without food and famished. We asked a waiter if he could help and within minutes our meals were served. Not sure how long they had been ready but the salmon was greasy and overcooked the beans were very undercooked and so we had a meal of potatoes costing £11.95 each. It was the worst meal in any hotel we have stayed in."
1218,GNHEAL,2017-07-31,4.0,"Ideal airport hotel Overall a good hotel, new so everywhere looks fresh & in good order. Had one issue which really did blight the experience. Waited nearly 15 mins at the bar for service and the only person standing there!!

Was flying out at 0630 hrs Monday morning and didn't want to travel on the day so this seemed worth giving a try having stayed in several of the hotels in the surrounding area. It's not clear from the hotel web page but if you are parking in long stay then head for zones G or F which is closest to the hotel NB it is cheaper to add an extra day to your airport parking than book via the hotel which even as a guest you pay £16 for overnight parking. We parked in zone C and walked to the hotel having ascended to the main road, did quite a dog leg because we missed the ramp down to the hotel because the sign is set well back off the road. It became clear when we checked in that we had missed the ramp as we were told by the person checking us in and pointed to a different entrance to the one we had used. Logged into the free WiFi quickly and easily and there was good coverage throughout the hotel - was able to stream short video clips with no problem.

Check in was quick and easy - we did arrive prior to check in time and had to wait but we simply had a beer and a snack. Luggage was left in a secure room. 

Nice sized room, if there was one thing I would say it is the only double bed is a queen size no king sized! Nice bathroom with a shower, soap, conditioner & body lotion in dispensers. TV is a little on the small side but given its a hotel people are usually transiting through not too much of an issue. Everywhere spotlessly clean as you would expect in such a new hotel and the challenge will be maintaining this standard.

Had both a snack and a dinner, it's fairly ordinary food but all of it was cooked and served very well. Had a few beers too and as mentioned above the only downside to the otherwise excellent service was when there was a change of staff - night shift coming on when it took a nose dive. The bar forms one limb of an L shape and check in desk the other limb of the L and I was standing at the angle in clear sight of the desk. Despite standing there a good time neither of the staff came to check if I wanted anything especially as my partner left the bar leaving me there so clearly wanting something???? I made the decision not to have another drink and made my feelings known as I left to the two staff standing at the check-in desk. It's a shame because this incident really distracted from our otherwise really good stay.

Breakfast was included in the price which given the time of our check out there was a continental breakfast only. Must admit struggled with this, very little ham available or cheese, would have thought there would have been some boiled eggs available which I have had in several hotels with a continental option. Very little cutlery around despite searching and looking in the empty holders under the counters. There was quick porridge available and I assume you either have to ask for hot water or use the beverage machine and hope you get the volume of water right. 

Check out was quick no problems at all and within an easy 5 minute walk we were in the airport terminal."

This perfectly located hotel is situated directly opposite the airport terminal building and has ample parking for guests. 

Rooms are clean, modern and spacious with a reasonable sized bathroom and excellent amenities. The double bed was particularly comfortable as were the pillows.

The bar/restaurant area is large and offers a wide selection of beverages at a reasonable price. The menu is limited but the meals served were delicious and generously sized and included dishes such as burger and chips, freshly prepared pizzas, jacket potatoes and a weekly curry. They also offer a daily special.

1224,CraigJ1805,2017-07-31,4.0,"Very Good Airport Hotel Only opened in February 2017 and everything is really new. Staff tell me the whole thing was imported in segments from China. It is a little quirky but overall a really good experience. The entrance and reception is enormous and a large part of it is a small bar and huge dining area. The food was OK but no more or less than you would expect. Staff very fireendly and efficient.

When you enter the room, it looks very spartan, but it is well finished, and quite frankly has everything you need including free and quick wifi,a nice lounger for watching TV, and an ample desk for work. Only adverse comment was the aircon was a bit noisy. Strange for a new place.

It is 3-4 minutes easy walk from Airport and 2 minutes to car rentals. Do not make the mistake I made. Arrived evening and picked up car right away - I did not need it until the morning. Result - you are liable for a £16.50 overnight parking charge - total rip off. The car park is owned and run by Bristol Airport, not the hotel, and they managed to get it reduced from an initial £28. The pay station tried to charge me £28, and I needed help from the hotel to call them to get the correct price. So watch out for that. .Needless to say, the car park had few cars in it. Totally outrageous price for a regional airport and I have emailed Bristol Airport to express my view.

Would thoroughly recommend the hotel for an overnight stopover and will stay here again"

No atmosphere at all as its a corporate sort of hotel. Food in bar poor and little choice but does the job if you have a choice though I'd go somewhere else, having said that there is no choice at the airport. . Unusual system of charging money per person to your credit card on arrival incase your room bill turns out more.... He took the room rate then a further £25 each person to spend at the hotel??? Pre authorised money, not sure why but as we didn't spend the full £50  when we checked out they put it back on the card. Breakfast was great plenty of choice and not crowded and plenty of it. I'd stay again if flying out of Bristol early, there's a covered walkway from the hotel to departures , it's really easy and convenient. Many thanks"

We eventually found the milk and cutlery perhaps a few more signs would have been good.

1229,Xym,2017-07-31,4.0,"Everything fine except coffee and ventilation I've got a lot of experience in Hampton Inns in the US, and this was my first time in Hampton in the UK.  The substitution of in-room coffee maker by a kettle (tea bags provided) is typically English and is very much welcome. 

Unfortunately, the hotel has substituted coffee altogether since the liquid dispensed at breakfast under the name of coffee was totally undrinkable.  Speaking of the breakfast, another  failure was porridge which was provided as powder in plastic containers which you are to pour hot water in, stir, and contemplate the result. I do not advice to move beyond contemplation to tasting, it is inedible. Generally I am not picky at all, and the standard breakfast fare by Hampton Inn leaves me completely satisfied. I understand this is not a Michelin restaurant and the food comes prefabricated, but nevertheless they must not fail such basic  things as coffee and porridge. Nevertheless the other breakfast items (scranbled eggs, bacon, bakery, etc.) were ok.

Another major drawback of this hotel  is room ventilation. The windows are shut tight and the handles are removed (I stayed for 4 nights in July). Air is to be provided by the built-in AC unit which tries to fulfill the purpose by snapping and clicking in the middle of the night, even if it is switched off. Apart from waking you up, not much is achieved. I prefer to be able to just open the window. In addition to better customer satisfaction, it would save the hotel the costs of running the system.

In all other aspects the hotel is very good. The room was spacious enough, clean and quiet (no aircraft noise at all). WiFi was ok. There are a lot of power outlets in the room (all are of the British standard) and there is a USB port in the alarm clock to charge a phone or whatever. I did not have time to try hotel's restaurant in the evenings but M&S Food store in the airport terminal suited me just fine.

Despite the shortcomings I would stay here again."

Air con needs attention, it was squeaking and rattling during the night, so not a perfect nights sleep. Breakfast is good but there are no vegetarian options to replace sausage and bacon which is a bit disappointing. However, would stay again."
1232,760patsyh,2017-07-31,2.0,"Understaffed, lacking leadership Reasonable accommodation, terrible service. Understaffed, only one 'chef' on duty, so had to wait one hour for a one-course meal. Manager disinterested, asked if we had heard of the Hampton Concept. Corporate bull....  ! He wandered around aimlessly. The whole place lacks leadership .... and any notion of customer service."
1233,KRS162269,2017-07-31,5.0,Surprised  Was expecting a typical airport hotel with very basic services and food. The room was very comfortable if a little small but the food was incredible. We chose a lamb shank which was to die for. A huge plateful with fresh cooked fine green beans and many new potatoes fora meagre £8.95. So sent us on our way fully revitalised . We would recommend this place to anyone who is not looking for 5* luxury but a pleasant 'on your way' stopgap.
1234,Galli39,2017-07-31,4.0,"Great hotel next to Bristol airport. Convenience plus! This is a convenient, new hotel. A short walk from the Bristol airport. It isn't a flash hotel, but it is clean, comfortable and quiet. Pillows good. Towels a bit thin. Breakfast ok, but across the road at the airport is an m and s food store. Great fruit and food there. Better than the hotel food. A very good hotel at the airport."
1235,GrizzlyIreland,2017-06-30,4.0,"Early Flight Arrived 23:00, check in was efficient and friendly.

Room was what you would expect and need for a stay at an airport hotel. Room was bigger than I expected for such a hotel. Quiet room overlooking airport. Bed comfortable and bathroom good, good quality walk in shower.

Member of night staff responsible for serving drinks at the bar, needs more training, not his fault, that would be company throwing someone in who clearly lacks experience and knowledge, but he was friendly.

Breakfast 04-06:00 continental- 06:00 Full English, which was good, except the orange juice. Hotel caters for Gluten free people.

We had to be at airport at 07:00, so a very brief stay which was exactly what we needed. 3-4 minute walk to airport.

Would stay again if flight times dictated - had previously stayed in Bristol and caught the Flyer bus."
1236,StevieMac2023,2017-07-31,5.0,"Hampton simply excellent! I'll keep this short..... Excellent from arrival to departure, staff and hotel were exceptional and could teach a few other independents a thing or two. If your flying in or out of Bristol I would certainly highly recommend staying at the Hampton as it's at the airport with a 2-3 minute walk from the front door, perfect!"
1237,LindyLou854,2017-07-31,1.0,"Don't bother Stayed overnight before an early morning flight from Bristol airport.  The hotel is clean, the staff are friendly, rooms are ok, bed is nowhere near as comfortable as a Premier Inn bed and they charge double the price of a Premier Inn.  The worst part was the restaurant.  Again, the staff were lovely, but there simply aren't enough of them.  There are probably 40 tables and there was just one person serving.  We waited 40 minutes for food and when we complained to the manager, he could only respond by asking us if we were familiar with ""The Hampton Concept?!""   If ""The Hampton Concept"" is to overcharge for an average hotel room and to be completely understaffed and be happy for guests to wait 40 minutes for over priced food, then yes, we are aware of that concept.   In future, we would catch an overnight Megabus to the airport prior to an early morning flight rather than pay good money to stay here."
1238,mycatstinx,2017-07-31,4.0,"Great location pre-early flight You can select your own room using the Hilton website.  We chose an end room, on the top floor, away from lifts and fire doors (hoping for a good night's sleep).  The shorter section on the plan is on the side away from the airport - we were facing the airport as we went for the long side.  There is sun in the evening in the shorter part of the hotel.  There is a covered walkway to the airport.  Breakfast buffet, from 4am, is perfectly adequate.  We made sandwiches to take on our flight.  There are takeaway cups for hot drinks.A full breakfast is served after 6am.
There were some odd noises during the night from the air-conditioning - ours was turned off but we could hear someone else's.
The bright alarm clock in the room has a dimmer switch on the front.
Everything was clean and modern.
Would use again for very early flights - takes the stress out of rushing to the airport up the M5 from Devon."
1239,RobertO865,2017-06-30,4.0,"Stay and fly We stayed the night prior to our flight.
As a result of a recent operation and a little less mobility than usual we booked a disabled room.
The room was well appointed and plenty of room to walk around as was the bathroom.
One cause for concern could be the door. It was really hard to push open and someone in a wheelchair or an older person pushing that person may find it difficult.
Assistance should be offered at front desk to all booking this type of room.
Very quiet in room considering proximity to airport.
Breakfast was more than adequate with everything self service. Only drawback on morning of my visit was a child playing football in seating/food area and no member of staff available to request parental intervention.
Finally, the hotel needs to look closely at its car parking charges. These could really hike up prices of stay if parking at venue."

1241,jaja1892Plymouth,2017-06-30,3.0,"Holiday airport stayover At last a long awaited airport hotel at Bristol.  Booked online through Booking.com although not the cheapest option the vicinity to the airport we thought would be the best choice for a nice chilled stay over before a flight the next day. 
Parking: I hadn't realised before booking that parking in this hotel is not free ! £16 for one night is a total rip off and if I had the option to cancel the booking I would have done so and stayed else where.
Check in: Relatively painless although I felt the staff member could have done with more training in customer services as we didn't feel we got a warm welcome and she didn't seem to know what she was doing when checking in.
Rooms:  Standard rooms, clean and tidy with good bathroom facilities. Noiseless from the flights landing and taking off.  Didn't really require the AC to be on even though it was a warm summers night while sleeping.  On to what we hoped would be a refreshing sleep before our flight in a really comfortable bed. During the night we were woken by what I assume was the AC making a gurgling/whining noise (although not switched on). Slept again, and 2 hours later happened again, 2 hours later happen again ! This really needs to be sorted out as I noticed this happened in other reviews. 
Bar/Food: Had a couple of drinks in the bar (reasonably priced for the location).  The food menu is really limited and the hotel is really missing out on a trick here.  We would have eaten here too if there had been a little more choice.
Breakfast: We thought breakfast was really tasty, good choices from fruit to full English, coffee to a good range of teas. 
Checkout: Quick but again training on customer services could be improved, not a single smile or courtesy of asking how our stay was (there was no one waiting and she didn't seem in a rush) and this would have been a nice touch and she seemed a little annoyed when asked to validate my parking to get the cheaper rate on leaving.
Overall: Probably wouldn't stay here again, despite it's location to the airport and good breakfast, cheaper parking and a good nights sleep is important combined with improvement in customer service or at least a smile (fake or genuine) from reception."
1242,F6915TRthomasg,2017-07-31,2.0,AC not coping Hot stuffy room (windows can't be opened in this airport hotel) which the air conditioning could do nothing to improve within 2 hours even though it was only 20 degrees outside. Best avoided if one wants a good night's sleep.

Room had a problem that shower wasn't draining and hotel services won't deal with it until morning. Snack bar is ok but mainly chocolate, food menu is basic but good enough. Bar service was not good in face pretty poor, the staff were more interested in chatting to a group of guys than serving the 5 people waiting. Food ordering was straight forward. Hotel very close to Bristol airport and less than a 5 minute walk. Plenty of space in hotel lobby but rooms are a little small but are a high standard.

The menu is basic bar so more than 2 nights I would not recommend. There is a lack of synergy between the hotel rooms and the restaurant. This hotel needs to put much more emphasis in food, quality and service as all are poor. They ran out of the basics, a lot of complaints and a lot of late service and below par food. Poor customer service apart from 2 members of staff. Would not be my personal choice as on business."

For the most part staying here was fine! However we headed down for breakfast at 10am, thinking we would easily be done and ready to check out by 11am. Breakfast is due to finish at 11, so it wasn't towards the end of service. I waited 20-30mins for hot food as everything was empty. They replaced the food while I was queuing and there was enough to serve the 5 people in the queue in front of me and then everything was empty again. It wasn't that busy and breakfast was prebooked so they knew catering numbers. It didn't seem that this was a one off as there was no apology. There also only appeared to be one man both cooking and replacing the food, I felt sorry for him, he needed someone to help!! I would only ever stay here for the location and I wouldn't pay for the breakfast again!!"

The hotel was clean, not very busy, friendly staff and quiet. We had a bite to eat in their cafe which was perfectly OK. The rooms were fine and the beds comfortable. However we didn't sleep much (even allowing for the early start) because the air con kept making a loud noise that could best be described as a growl, cutting in and out all night.
Breakfast opened at 4.00am so we managed to grab some before walking to departures which was good. Overall it was worth doing but hope they sort out the noisy air con."

The short stay parking seems very expensive and the hotel do not seem to offer parking as part of the booking. 

The rooms are modern and efficient as you would expect from a brand new hotel. the breakfast  is included and offers the usual  selection. The breakfast seemed a bit short staffed as things like cutlery were running gear out but maybe I visited after a busy period. The hotel has the flight information on a screen in reception so check it out before taking the short walk up to the terminal because if your flight is delayed you can stay at the hotel and drink free coffee at breakfast instead of hanging around the departure terminal."

1261,k1of2ksy,2017-06-30,4.0,"Pre flight stay Great time have an on airport hotel at last. Pity about the signage as depending on where you are you can miss the signs as we did and when we asked a member of airport staff they set us the long way round, looking at the signs later they look as if they are for vehicle access so a person walking 🚶🏾 alongside would assist.
A friendly welcome was received from the receptionist who greeted us as gold members. The room was large, comfy bed and great air con. Lovely toiletries on dispensers although husband was a little disappointed with the shower as it didn't have much oomph.
We can't comment on the food as we got a picnic from M&S in the terminal and we had a very early flight so missed breakfast but we have already booked for September."
1262,DigbyUk,2017-06-30,3.0,"Could be improved We were unable to book directly with the hotel but were referred to a call centre on a phone line which had terrible acoustics. The hotel is situated close to the airport but is poorly signed, especially at night. Those with heavy luggage may find the tortuous ramp rather tiring. 
Reception was quick and efficient. The room was basic but appeared to have all the necessary items for a one night stay. On closer inspection the toilet seat was not secure and a drawer in the beside cabinet would not close.
When using the shower we found that a shower/bath mat was missing and the shower did not drain efficiently.   
These items were mentioned a checkout and a small reduction in the bill was secured.      
Breakfast had plenty of choice, however the coffee was obtained from automatic dispensers and failed our flavour test.
Overall, a basic hotel, not cheap, trying its best but needs to ensure that housekeeping reports room defects and that these are acted on.   This is a new hotel and is already showing scuff marks on the walls.
We would stay there again because of its location, but next time will inspect the room before accepting it."

However, a bit miffed that having paid nearly £100 for the night I had to pay £1 for 10 mins while I dropped off our bags before taking the car to the long term car park. I know it's only a small sum but surely the hotel could allow guests say 20 mins free parking while they checked in?"

We arrived looking forward to  a light meal before retiring early as we had to leave hotel at 5.30 a.m. However the unexciting, limited menu was even more unexciting and limited than we first thought! I chose a salmon steak which when it arrived at the table appeared to be overcooked at each end but uncooked in the centre! Very pleasant waitress, Jazmin, took it back to the kitchen and the second attempt was edible - just! Thank you, Jazmin! My husband had a burger which was ok.

The bedroom was very comfortable and soundproofed. The bathroom was very well appointed with lovely fluffy towels. Air conditioning and/or heating controls were very easy to operate in the bedroom. The breakfast which is available from 4.00 am for Continental or a full English from 6.00 am was very good indeed.   (Even the sausages were of a very good quality) The up-hill walk from the hotel to the air terminal is to be considered - especially for us elderly folk with a couple of cases and a wheelchair to push.   There doesn't seem to be an alternative to the walk.
1266,V693BYdavidw,2017-06-30,5.0,"A Great Addition to Bristol Airport. This is a great new addition to the facilities at Bristol Airport and makes using this as a location for travel a much more enjoyable experience than having to travel(even short distances) for morning flights especially as was previously the case. This is not highest-end accommodation, but is in line with the Hampton brand what they do, they do very well. OK, this is a new hotel, so it should be good - but, provided upkeep is maintained, this has to be the first-choice stopover at Bristol Airport. Bear in mind there is effectively no parking at the hotel, but this apart, you should not be disappointed by your stay."

1268,Twerpic,2017-06-30,3.0,"Brand new facility close to airport but inconvenient access and noisy bedroom AC I used this property for 2 nights whilst visiting colleagues in the South West of UK. Access to and from the terminal, although nearby and a short walk is inconvenient for those with heavy bags since it involves either negotiating four flights of steps or taking a meandering ramp which adds about 300m to the walk. Having enquired the night before departing as to whether there would be anyone available in the morning to assist me with my heavy and bulky luggage on departure the following morning I was assured there would be. In fact on checking out early the next morning I was told that only 2 reception staff were on duty and both were busy, so sorry - no assistance available.

The hotel itself is brand new, clean and tidy and with entirely adequate facilities including a well equipped gym, all of which I enjoyed. However the sleep quality was marred by a very noisy AC in the bedroom which could not be set to anything above 25C and which never turned off automatically even at that high temperature setting. The only alternative was to manually switch it off."

- Didn't spot much signage from the various car-parks around the hotel to the hotel itself.
- I wasn't sure how parking was supposed to operate; the Hilton website said that ""Parking at the Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport is provided by the Airport and can be reserved in advance."" Now did this mean I should use the Airport Parking website or the Hotel's website? In the end I chose the Bristol Airport Parking website and ended up paying almost £60 for what was a one and a half day stay!

It is located a few minutes walk from the terminal and there is a slope only route to and from the terminal, with a shorter route offering only a few steps. Despite the location there was almost no evidence of aircraft related noise. The rooms are modern and well equipped and the beds are comfortable. The hotel is quiet - an important factor if you want to turn in early. The two stand out ideas were breakfast and general dining. A continental breakfast is available from 04.00 hours and provided an excellent choice and speedy self service. The general dining is simple but allows for a limited choice pub grub type meal, with swift service. No fuss no bother the hotel recognises that you are only passing through and not here to stay for any length of time at the hotel."

1277,507DavidN507,2017-06-30,5.0,"Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport - A Great Place to Stay...BUT... We were visiting friends in Bristol and decided to stay here for four nights. Being a Hilton Honours member I got a good deal, so felt it was a good place to stay.

The hotel is brand new and in a good location to visit our friends who live in Backwell, close to the airport.

When we arrived we were greeted very warmly by the young lady behind reception. We were quickly checked in and we located our room.

The room was a great room which was lovely and clean and comfortable. The bed and pillows were really comfortable. There was a lovely bathroom with a great walk in shower and an abundance of great toiletries.

We quickly found out that it was a struggle to keep the room nice and warm even though the temperature outside was quite warm.  One downside to the room was the fact that there were only 6 coat hangers. We were here for four nights so had a lot of clothes to hang up. It looks like the rooms are only geared up for people flying away on holiday.

We decided to have a snack in the bar only to find that the menu was limited, so we had to walk up to the airport terminal building to get a snack. There is an M&S food shop so we were spoilt for choice. The hotel should offer a better menu to stop people like us looking for a better choice somewhere else. The hotel is missing a trick there!

The wifi in the room was good and the breakfast area is great with a good selection of hot and cold breakfast items. Whilst we were having breakfast the lady was working really hard to ensure that all the breakfast items were topped up for customers. She was also very friendly. 

We really enjoyed our breakfast.

We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel...but... the car parking situation is a fiasco!

As a Hilton Honours member I object to paying £16.50 per night to park my car. I was advised to park in the airport's long stay car park at a lower cost but why should I have to walk a distance every time I wanted to use my car to drive to meet our friends. I wanted to park it right outside the hotel. On top of that the ticketing for the car park is a joke. I was told that the car park is operated by Bristol Airport car parking and that they dictate to the hotel how cars can be parked. I had to get my new car park ticket validated every day by the hotel otherwise I would have had to pay £28 every day to access the car park and park my car. For the four nights that I stayed at the hotel my car was only parked there 8 hours every night because we were out and about in my car around Bristol with our friends during the day. Therefore it wasn't taking up a car parking space during the day. 

So I had to basically pay £16.50 every night to park my car in a hotel where I have a loyalty membership. On top of that and to add insult to injury, if you pay by credit card, they whack you with another 2.5%! Unbelievable! I find this extremely disappointing and if Hilton don't get a grip on this, they will lose valuable HH members to other competitive hotel brands close to the airport. 

When Hilton decided to build their Hampton Inn on this site why didn't they negotiate to purchase the rights to the car park when the deal was done? They would then be able to provide multi-night stay customers with a competitive and hassle free car parking experience. Hilton have now got a massive 'anchor' on this site now and will find it difficult to negotiate a better deal with Bristol Airport authority for car parking.

This car parking fiasco needs to be sorted by Hilton ASAP or they will lose valuable customers.

It's a great place to stay...But!"
1278,tamarman33,2017-05-31,3.0,"Good hotel but stay away from the food Stayed at the Hilton a few weeks ago as my wife and I had an early flight to Malta. Cannot fault the hotel accommodation. Everything is new and clean. Service was good and all staff amicable. 
Visited the restaurant for an evening meal and although not much choice my wife had the Lamb shank and I had the curry. Meal arrived in a matter of minutes which led me to believe it had been kept warm for a few hours or was nuked in a micro wave. The latter seemed to be the case. Lamb edible new potatoes and green beans seriously nuked and hard. Curry was the standard you would get from a £1.50 chilled dish from Tesco. Not only poor quality but gave me a runny tummy for 3 days in Malta. Breakfast was just OK."
1279,aislingf2013,2017-06-30,5.0,Comfort and cleanliness Really enjoyed my brief overnight stay here. Room was excellent; spotlessly clean...comfortable bed...lovely bathroom...good quality towels...suitable amenities. Lovely and quiet too. Food in bar area is well priced and the layout is really relaxed and the plentiful charging points are great too. Breakfast was included and excellent choice of items. Really could not fault it. Will definitely stay here again if needing an overnight in the area.

I wasn't impressed with he staff though, the member of staff who greeted me didn't even say hello. He then just mumbled at me and when I asked him to repeat himself he rolled his eyes. I then asked about car parking and he told me the cost £16.50 (ridiculous) and then told me I would need to get my ticket validated or the price will double in 12 hours. He was quite happy to let me come back at 3 am to get it validated before a member of staff told him it was 11am it needs to be validated by. Offered no apology and just turned away. The staff just seemed put out everyone I baked anything. Cost of parking and staff who don't smile or want to be there means I won't stop again but if nothing else just ask your staff to smile and wish your customers a nice stay!"

If you're staying overnight there before an early flight don't forget to advance book into one of the airport car parks rather than park in the hotel car park - they are a lot cheaper! Very disappointing stay - yes the hotel is new and clean BUT the air conditioning in our room made a loud clicking noise throughout the night, the shower plughole was blocked and the water  only slowly went away. The dinner menu is very limited and the bar prices are very high! We had a continental breakfast as we had a very early flight and the croissants were like bricks! We will never stay there again!"

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of certain members of the hotel reception staff who were on duty during the Saturday afternoon of our arrival - as per a number of previous reviews, their apparent complete lack of customer service skills and indifference / disinterest in relation to hotel guests was almost breathtaking to behold. We would hope, given the number of previous comments re lack of customer service skills / sullen attitude etc of a very small number of front of house staff, that the hotel management would have already identified the ""problem areas"" and that appropriate steps will be taken to address these issues. We are due to visit the hotel again at the end of July - hopefully at that point we can be slightly more positive in our overall comments re the reception staff. We shall see................."

The hotel's website pictures make the rooms seem good-sized. In fact, my wife and I had to squeeze by each other because the room was so small. Good news: the room was clean and  quiet, the beds comfortable, the shower good (but for some reason no washcloths). Our check in was friendly and helpful, and the restaurant/bar was nice and reasonably priced. We paid the exorbitant price for the room in order to be at the airport for our early-morning flight. If the cost drops down to $100 or so, we would stay there again for the convenience of being right there at the airport."

First pint pulled not drinkable. Seating very uncomfortable. Mixer I ordered with short not available but was only told this after short poured. Menu bland and unimaginative.

Bar menu was very limited and could do with improvements.  Sandwich menu was poor. Is the best you can do is cheese and tomato and ham. 

I had the chicken wings which though tasty were tiny.  Rather have paid more to have some chips with them or even better sweet potato chips.

The hotel is new and the rooms are spacious, very comfortable and surprisingly quiet, no noise at all. Staff are very friendly
If you stay overnight at this hotel and want dinner you are restricted to the hotel restaurant as the airport only has coffee bars open and nothing else in the area. Unfortunately the hotel seems to have a recurring problem of very long waits for your meals,(1 hour and 5 minutes), they seem to be understaffed and this is noticeable at breakfast as well.

One major drawback to using this hotel as an overnight stop unless you are flying is the very expensive overnight parking fee of £16.50. This is the dearest hotel self-parking I have come across.

Would stop at this hotel again if flying from Bristol but would have my evening meal on the way to the airport."

It is very convenient to the airport with only a short walk to the departure / check in. If you are driving I would recommend including your hotel stay car parking in the airport site as the hotel carpark for one night is very expensive. The signage for the hotel needs to be improved from the airport carpark although the hotel is an obvious sight from the car park getting there through the large parking area isn't as obvious. The bar prices for food and drink are ridiculous and the food is of poor quality for the cost, we had two drinks and two burgers with fries and this came to just over £30, The burgers were very dry and tasteless as were the fries. Our morning flight was early and we therefore could only take advantage of the limited breakfast on offer at 4am. This however was very disappointing, we only had coffee and even this had to be without milk as neither of the two machines had any, this was also raised by many other guests present ! Very poor indeed considering we were some of the first people to breakfast so they certainly had not run out, simply a case of very poor preparation on the hotels part. We paid £100 for the night and it was far short of what we have become used to from Hilton after staying on at least 3 occasions at their Exeter airport hotel and being a Hilton honours member. Our room was fine as were the reception staff but other than the hotel's location and convenience we were not overly impressed which is really unfortunate as we are far from the average complainers."

Very easy to make an online (Bristol Airport website) booking for a combined hotel and car park stay.  Not really much to add to previous reviews about this very new hotel (and that had only opened 2 months earlier).  To be able to drive straight to the hotel, book in, go to one's room, dump one's luggage and to then be able to take one's car to whichever car park one had booked and to then return to the hotel without hauling suitcases is a very good and easy arrangement.
Rooms are fine but at first we thought, odd, no coat hanging space (until we found it was hidden behind the loo sliding door!), also odd, no safe (until we found it concealed behind a drawer door!).  
A nice restaurant area, although we did feel the menu for main courses was rather limited.
A few minutes walk, a bit uphill, to the terminal by ramp or steps.  However, the signing of the ramp route needs to be improved, especially from terminal exit down to the hotel.

I was a little surprised that the hotel didn’t have a proper restaurant. The food on the bar menu wasn’t great to be honest – oven pizza and similar “quick cook” options. You could always walk over to the terminal to find something better to eat but I would personally have expected better quality.

1322,Dubaiification,2017-05-31,5.0,"Just What Bristol Airport Needed Bristol Airport has been crying out for a decent hotel on-site for many years. The Hampton by Hilton certainly delivers.

The hotel is located adjacent to the arrivals entrance of the airport, just down the ramp or some steps. A short walk through a covered area brings you to the rear of the hotel. The front car park is managed by Bristol Airport and therefore changed at their standard short stay rates. I parked my car in the long stay prebooked to save a considerable amount.

I did the check in on the Hilton app, including my room selection. On arrival there was a warm welcome, and my key card issued quickly. The reception area is bright, trendy and clean.

The room was the good standard of nearly every Hampton in the UK. Everything you could think of for a short stay. Hair drier, iron, TV, desk chair and comfortable bed.

The bathroom had a large powerful shower with excellent pressure and temperature. Three dispensers of shampoo, conditioner and body wash are on the wall. The quality seemed more than adequate.

I had a bar meal in the reception/lounge area and it was quick, good value and tasty. I can throughly recommend the pizza, which had a nice tomato stuffed crust.

Breakfast is included and offered from 4am, but as I had an early flight just grabbed a glass of water before heading to the terminal. Everything looked great though and was well stocked.

A great stay, in a great location for the airport."

Powerful showers which is always good but the water didn't drain away quick enough which was a pain.

Nice breakfast and plenty of seating.

Parking is very expensive at £16.50 a night. I understand this is an airport but what use is a nearly empty car park. Make the charges reasonable and it will appeal a lot more to people using the hotel not for the airport.

The menu looks good but the food is of the lowest common denominator and tastes cheap. For dinner we had the salmon that was overcooked, what tasted like frozen beans heated up in the microwave and potatoes, also had a beef burger that was the smallest I have ever seen! The chips were warm and soggy and the coleslaw was preprepared and not very nice.  No worries about dinner we were looking forward to breakfast ... oh dear it faired no better - cheap, tasteless sausages, watery salty bacon and scrambled eggs slightly grey in colour.... the baked beans were good and there was quite a wide selection of food ... but that's it :-( 

We were disappointed - come on Hilton improve your food as it is clear you are using cheap ingredients and poor preparation to maximise your profits.

PS if you are put through to the central booking office somewhere in the USA then they will say that you can park your car free whilst staying overnight at the hotel.  This is not the case.  We were shocked to find that you have to pay for parking overnight but the staff managed to get us into the long stay one day early so it was ok but beware .... no free parking!"

Breakfast is continental from 4am to 6am then cooked from 6am.  It is included in the price which is  a shame as personally i don't want to eat directly before a flight so a bit of a waste of money.  It would be nice if they offered a room only rate for those who literally want to sleep before getting up for an early morning flight.  The parking fees are high, so better off doing what i did and parking up in the airport car park which was £3 more for arriving the evening before and then walking to the airport.  it is on the car park side of the airport, just past arrivals.  
I would certainly use it again if I had another really early flight."
1329,AMBHAMP,2017-05-31,4.0,"Pre flight stay Great location for the airport, simply cross the road for the terminal. Easy to walk to from long stay car park, but they could do with some signage from the car park to the entrance to the hotel, as we walked up to the terminal before we realised there was an easier access to the hotel from the car park just before the steps. Hotel is spotlessly clean. The room was comfortable with a great bathroom. The restaurant / bar area is large with plenty of seating.  Check in was fast and efficient. Food was a let down, very limited choice and hugely overpriced for the quality. Would stay again but wouldn't eat here ever again."

A few more staff on reception would be helpful to avoid having to queue for attention.  Staff were knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.  Continental breakfast from 4 am was very helpful for our early flight:  Great selection of food and drink for breakfast; much less choice in evening meals and bar snacks, but good quality food.  If trying to find this hotel from the terminal cross the road straight outside the terminal building and head down the steps -- ignore your instinct to walk left immediately you leave the terminal.  Takes about 5 minutes to get there."

Hotel is very new , so decor excellent and clean. Very noisy however from corridor when people talking outside their rooms. 
Great shower.
Early breakfast from 4 am was ok but coffee machine had a fault and all 3 of bananas being so badly bruised that I did not want any of them. Porridge in containers to add hot water was an excellent idea .

1345,chrisbale1974,2017-04-30,4.0,"Hampton by Hilton, Bristol (Airport) I booked into the Hampton by Hilton, Bristol Airport Hotel late April 2017 seeing as I was down in the Bristol area through work. 

On the whole I was thoroughly impressed with this hotel, staff are polite and courteous and all round the facilities within the hotel are very good, it's all very comfortable from lounge to dining areas and there's even a fully equipped gym available.

The bedroom (Room 143) complete with en suite in which I stayed was very clean, immaculate and smart in presentation (Photos included in my review) albeit it probably a bit basic and Spartan for some people's tastes but this suited me down to the ground as I have a strong dislike for very cluttered and fussy rooms which collect dust easily.

I'm delighted to say that the double bed was really comfortable and more than big enough for a 6' 5' tall guy like myself, full marks for that one!

Appropriate tea and coffee facilities are available within the room and a decent enough sized television with all TV channels, hotel information and tourist attractions. There are plenty of sockets available for any electrical appliances you may need to use and there is also an iron, ironing board and hairdryer provided inside the wardrobe area which you can access via a sliding door.

Continental breakfasts start from 0400 with the cooked 'help yourself' British buffet breakfast with sausages and bacon kicking off from 0600, there's pretty much a good selection of everything for all tastes, so something for everyone.

My only niggle was having to pay for the car parking on the way out. If this could have been incorporated into the final payment made when checking out of the hotel, then this could make life a little easier. I know it's a bit fickle of me to highlight this one small thing and I'm pretty sure I'll not be alone in my way of thinking.

Final summary, Hampton by Hilton, Bristol Airport is a very good hotel, I'd be happy to stay there again in the future and willing to recommend the place to all."
1346,PG2220,2017-04-30,4.0,"Great new hotel Staying at a hotel before early morning flights from Bristol always meant trying to find a hotel as close as possible, but now with this great located hotel it's only a 2 minute walk to the airport. Room was very comfy and quiet. Didn't use any other facilities but a bar and snacks were available and a free breakfast served from 4am. Only downside was it is slightly more expensive and you have to pay for an extra night parking, but as long as it stays competitive in price will use again and again."

Easy check-in with a friendly and efficient member of staff.  Hilton standard - well appointed room with comfy bed and pillows.  Walk-in shower in bathroom.
You are allowed 1 hour parking in the hotel car park for free which allows you time to check-in and put your bags in your room before moving your car to the long stay car park.  However, the pedestrian access from the long stay car park is not that good when walking back to the hotel.

The staff are very friendly, helpful and approachable and the hotel is excellent and reasonable."
1353,topfca,2017-03-31,4.0,"Pleasant hotel but room for some improvement Stayed here for one night at the end of March to avoid having to get to the airport in the morning.
I didn't arrive until after midnight. There were no guests in the reception area and two people behind the counter, one doing paperwork etc. I was completely ignored for a minute or so then the one who was unoccupied asked me if I was ok and I said I wanted to check in so he then asked the other man to deal with me.
I had already checked in online using the Hilton Honors app so the process was swift and efficient but there was no welcome as such.
Now the worst bit - I had selected my room online (Room 374) and I was given the keycard for it. However when I reached the room, I found that the bed had already been used with the quilt pulled back and the pillows had signs of use. Although there was a keycard in the slot on entry, there was no luggage in the room and it was otherwise clean but I was not happy to stay in there so I returned to reception. I was then given a similar room (370) which was fine but I was given no more than a casual apology.
The room itself was fine with a comfortable bed and pillows, good lighting etc but unfortunately just a shower and no bath, although there was plenty of room for a bath. I didn't ask but there does not appear to be an option to select a room with a bath (as opposed to the Hampton by Hilton at Exeter Airport where you can select a room with a bath). The air conditioning was very effective and a nice change to find somewhere that does not turn off the cooling function overnight.
The biggest disappointment with the room is that the curtains were not full blackout curtains and, although dark, they did let in a degree of light in the morning. I know Hampton by Hilton is a different brand to Hilton but my experience of Hilton hotels is that they invariably have full blackout curtains. To me this is particularly important at airport locations as people often want to rest in the day and can be flying to and from different time zones.
Although I didn't get up until 9.30am, I did not bother with the breakfast so I cannot comment on that.
This was my first stay at this hotel and undoubtedly I will stay there again purely because of the convenience of the location. I was certainly not disappointed except for the curtains but I just felt that the whole experience could have been better."

Linen and towels superb quality. Breakfast was very good and all you could ever want! Be aware as you approach the car park that has a sign saying you have to pay, but on close inspection you get 20 mins drop off time and get ticket validated at reception to depart to park in perminant car park. Would definitely use again even though we live within one hour of airport as it takes the worry of getting to terminal on time. A very easy short walk to check in at terminal."

1360,Pickywitch,2017-04-30,4.0,"Perfect location We stayed here after flying in from a long haul flight late at night.

The hotel is so conveniently situated for the airport.

The staff were friendly and welcoming.

Being so new the room was incredibly clean and the soundproofing on the windows 
meant no noise at all from planes.

On the downside the aircon unit was incredibly noisy making for a very disturbed night.

Breakfast was disappointing. We are at around 8am on a Sunday morning, the restaurant was very quiet with maybe 6 others tables in use.
The floor around the hot drinks stations had many, many spills. Some of which didn't look fresh. The floor in other parts didn't look particularly clean either.
Cutlery was tricky to find as the many cutlery holders hadnt been replenished.
The hot food counter offers the usual components of a standard English breakfast however the bacon and scrambled egg were not hot, the egg was barely warm.

As an aside because it isn't relevant to our experience I felt the staff uniform was casual to the point of scruffy.

The handy location of the hotel means I would stay again but my expectations would be low."

1365,GirlDanni,2017-03-31,3.0,"Extremely convenient location for the airport If you are flying from Bristol Airport this hotel gets a 5/5 for location. Situated by the main hire car drop off area you could ask for a more convenient location. 

The hotel is brand new so as was to be expected the rooms and furnishings were clean, comfortable and modern. 

I had an early flight so was pleased to hear a continental breakfast was served from 4am. 

The reasons the hotel doesn't get more than an average rating for me however is that while I couldn't hear any outside noise, inside the room was another story. I was woken throughout the night by bangs and strange noises emanating from the direction of the bathroom/hall. Front of desk staff as well, while not impolite, we're lacking in a warm welcome. Hopefully these are teething problems and will be resolved as it is a hotel worthy of consideration for location alone."

The rooms are clean and there is a very nice bathroom with a shower.  However, the hotel does have a few teething problems.  The first was the automatic door did not work and it was quite heavy to open without electrical assistance, only one of the two lifts were operational, in the room there was only two sweeteners and no sugar, at breakfast the coffee machines did not work though one of them was fixed later and finally the sausages and bacon had not been refilled.  I am sure it will be a very good hotel but it is not there yet.  For all that we did have a comfortable night.  One final gripe, it is the first hotel I have stayed you have to pay to be dropped off – really not acceptable."
1367,D2867LQchristopherr,2017-03-31,5.0,"Satisfied Friendly, staff and clean room. Air con very noisy during the night. Rooms clean, hard to maintain the temperature of the shower and plus the water in shower tray didn't drain very quickly. Location very handy to rental cars and airport."
1368,989bobk,2017-03-31,2.0,"Underwhelming First the good points. The hotel is new, very clean, bright, pleasant with well appointed rooms. There are no rooms with bath tubs but this was fine with me as I enjoy the showers at the newer Hampton Inns. The hotel is right next door to the airport terminal, although it is a 3 minute UPHILL walk. 

Now the problems. Although the hotel has its own parking lot, it is operated by Bristol Airport which charges about 17.50 pounds to park overnight with NO concessions for hotel guests. This is a diabolical overnight charge BUT it gets worse. You have to pay to just register for your room and drop your suitcases off (I think 1.50 UKL). I had pre-arranged and paid for parking at the adjacent Premier Parking Lot (again at a rip off rate) and did not want to pay again just to let my handicapped wife enter the lobby. 

Although the hotel did not seem to be full, the choice of rooms was extremely limited. No ice machine or guest laundry and lacking in atmosphere on a cold blustery English March evening. The food on offer seems very limited - I would describe it as poor bar food. We ordered a pizza which we took to our room - it was OK but about twice what I would expect to pay.

Hampton Inns have a decent free breakfast. Because our flight departed at 7.00 a.m. we could not stay and indulge in the breakfast but we were offered a continental breakfast. Again, sounds good but the reality was something else. The orange juice dispensing machine was broken, there was no jam or marmalade for toast or croissants, and guests were complaining that the coffee machine was also non-functioning. Overall it was an underwhelming experience that was not inexpensive. 

Not the hotels fault, but my whole experience at Bristol Airport left a lot to be desired. Rip off parking fees, way out in the middle of nowhere, crowded at 6.00 a.m. in the morning, vastly overpriced shops, slow security and primitive. Our EasyJet flights to Barcelona were a false bargain when taking into account the charges we had to pay."

1370,889theresac,2017-03-31,1.0,"If you are disabled or just need help, forget it. 

We stayed with you the night before we flew.
I booked the hotel for ease, as the details state a short walk to the terminal.
I parked at the main door to advise reception that we had arrived, i advised we had 2 large bags a wheel chair + other small bags and a husband that does not walk very well, hence the wheelchair.
There were a number of staff not doing very much, it would have been nice if a member of staff could have offered to help.
But no i had to do it all, i should not have to ask.
In the reception area, were the large trollys that you get in the better quality hotels, so not much lifting was required.!

I dropped off my husband at the door, along with our luggage.
Just to add a little extra, i had a hip replacement last year.

I drove the car to silver parking as i could not get parking at the hotel for the time that we were away.

Good job really, i was alarmed to discover how much walking was involved from the terminal.
I asked a member of staff on my return from parking the car about help the next morning as we left the hotel at 5am, some suggestions but nothing was very helpful.
My Husband had to push his own wheelchair while i pulled the suitcases,this took us at least 15 minutes.
My husband suffered chest pains for about 1 hour after the walk.

It would have been easier to stay at the holiday inn or one of the other hotels,at least you get door to door service.

We paid £99 to be just a short walk to the terminal, that caused us both pain stress and worry that my husband may not be able to fly had the chest pains continued.

We had a starter in the restaurant and a main meal, it all came out together, luckerly we had to send the barbecue chickens wings back, that were not with chilli that we could not eat them, and ordered a salad as a replacement, that we almost got as a desert

Only area for improvement is signage from premium parking, we parked near and didn't realize we didn't have to walk around to the front.  Overall it was well worth it and we were fresh and ready to face the airport crush."
1380,JayneT47,2017-03-31,4.0,"Very convenient for an early flight I only booked the Hampton about two weeks before we stayed, and I got a very good deal through the Hilton website. £84 including breakfast.
The hotel is brand new and all the furnishings are beautiful. The bathroom features a large walk-in shower with all the toiletries you need, there's a hairdryer and iron in the wardrobe and free wifi.
The staff were all very courteous and professional. There was an issue with the meal I ordered from the bar but this was dealt with in a very professional way and we even got a free round of drinks for our trouble.
Just let down a bit by the complementary hot and cold breakfast which was a bit disorganised (coffee and juice machines not working) but I'm sure they'll soon sort out these minor glitches. Would definitely stay again"
1381,ExpatKL88,2017-03-31,2.0,"Poor Service First night after delayed flight on Saturday and check in after 6pm was reasonable for this new hotel and food in the bar was pretty good.Comfortable nights sleep, bathroom small but well lit and a good size shower..my rating for this would have been a rating of 4...Return for one night on the following Wednesday saw us arriving at the hotel just after mid-day..receptionist was insistent that we had to adhere to policy of 3pm  check in and to sit it out in reception. No checking to see if there were any available rooms was to me a completely negative approach to the customer particularly as this is an airport hotel and the first time I have met such an uncaring response when people are flying in at all hours and as such I have dropped the rating to reflect this."
1382,spainkt,2017-03-31,5.0,"Great place to stay before flying  Stayed one night before flying out of Bristol, really relaxed atmosphere, lovely room with great shower, very comfortable bed, had everything you would need for a short stay. Food in bar limited but good, bar prices very reasonable, would I stay again, definitely! I was using a hire car, so returned that before checking in, so avoided any parking charges, which seem to be the main complaint from anyone writing a review."
1383,MrHard2Please,2017-03-31,4.0,"excellent location within airport When you're late off the plane and it's raining, you'll be glad you booked this hotel. 2 minutes walk from arrivals, a warm welcome and comfortable rooms await. Newly opened, I wonder how well it will survive the rigours of an airport hotel. A lot of the fittings and finish (perfectly good now) don't look that robust.  My only criticism was that the breakfast was based around mass catering products rather than better quality produce. I would rather pay a bit more."
1384,Mike77uk,2017-03-31,5.0,One night stay 18th March 2017 This hotel has only been open for 3 weeks and everything looks and feels brand new.  Our room was very clean and tidy plenty of room for 2 people.  I thought the bar prices were very reasonable not much more than what I pay at home.  The hotel offers a early continental breakfast if you have a early start.  The continental breakfast was Ok nothing special and the Orange juice machine only served water.  The had a evening meal which which was very bland could have been better with a little more attention and seasoning.  the staff were very friendly and attentive.  Only a few minutes walk from the departures lounge.  We would use this hotel again
1385,Q954IYamandac,2017-03-31,4.0,"Great stay Stayed here for a few nights. Room was lovely. Food was nice, staff were very friendly. My only issue was the parking costs they were a bit high especially as you pay so much to stay there in the first place. Would use again x"
1386,Joe9t,2017-03-31,4.0,"Hotel stay before airport trip Recommended for hotel before flight! Everything as expected however breakfast could have been on par with other hamptons but this was only their 3rd week open and as a diamond member wasn't really treated as a member that used their services so much. However they were very close to expectations. I used the night on points 10k which was externally good fo value,I would give them another go for my next trip to see how it goes."
1387,Andymcforest,2017-03-31,4.0,"Good, but can do better Stayed here last Saturday night, the receptionist's were very welcoming. Our room was spot on. Then we went to the bar. Barman was friendly, got our drinks which were expensive, even for a hotel, unfortunately the beer was flat and at £4•10 should be a bloody good pint, see picture. Next morning went for breakfast and was disappointed. The scrambled eggs were stone cold, and bacon greasy. I understand these are all teething issues and by the time we next visit hopefully things will be much better"
1388,A1228BOrichardh,2017-03-31,1.0,"Beware Nice hotel, but they charge £16.50 per day for parking even if your a guest - appalling. Room was clean, fresh and modern, but noisy plumbing. I parked here for 8 hours checked in and got some sleep after a long flight. Only to wake up to be told that I would need to pay £16.50 to get my car out. No discounts. I'll never stay at a Hilton because of this experience."
1389,SamuelR001,2017-03-31,4.0,"New and nice I stayed for one night on business.  The hotel was in only its third week of operations and everything is new and smells new.  The pictures o the website show exactly what you get.

Well equipment gym with mats, balls, balance dome, machines, towels, water, etc.

The rooms are quiet  and hotel noise is well damped.

Location,Location,Location - 150m from the airport along a well lit pathway.  Right next to 4 or 5 car hire parking lots.

Issues:- I had breakfast at 09:00 and was disappointed to see a number of empty bowls on the counter (no croissants left, no cut fruit left) and the juice dispenser was just dripping water on the floor - made things look slap dash and not in keeping with the high standard maintained in the rest of the hotel.

I will stay here again the next time I need one night at Bristol airport."

1391,mauriciojosec2017,2017-03-31,3.0,"Great location but disappointing Brand new hotel. A few small issues to iron out (banging bathroom doors, staff don't know the system or the location of the gym!  The location is great if you have an early flight, but don't expect any views nor a 'quiet' environment.  The breakfast area is completely unattended by hotel staff - and coffee is simply not good.  My overall recommendation is that this hotel is too pricy for what it is."
1392,J6076WQmichaelr,2017-03-31,5.0,Best ever  Best airport hotel I've spent time in the staff are top class and the hotel is lovely and clean the breakfast in lovely with pretty of choice and the bed is very nice for a good nights sleep it's just great book it.

Laura, Jess, Will, Mar and Ana all went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. The atmosphere was great and we had a great laugh at the bar with Laura and Jess. Check in was fast and friendly. Will definitely stay again!"
1394,katherineb411,2017-03-31,5.0,"Painless travelling We booked this hotel as we had an early morning flight at 6.30am. Usually we would have to get up at 3am, drive for 1.5 hours, park and hope we get to the airport in time.  Luckily the hotel has only just opened and it meant we could have a reasonable night's sleep and be refreshed and enjoy our first day's holiday.  Clean, comfortable and quite and only a very short walk to departures.  friendly and helpful staff.  The evening food menu is fairly limited but adequate and all we wanted was  glass of wine, some bread and olives.  From 4am a free buffet continental breakfast is available which just hit the spot coffee, fruit juice and croissant for us but we could have had more.  Free cooked breakfast buffet from 6am but that would have been too late for us.  Ideal.  We would definitely use this hotel again."

Lovely linen and towels. Everything sparkling clean. Lots of power points and free wifi. Everything you needed and very friendly, helpful staff at reception. Surprised by the breakfast options that are included. Not gourmet but a wide choice and everything you could want. I'd defo book again and look forward to it. Parking is pricey but then you have pay a £1 for 10 minutes at the drop so to be expected."

Well done to all  the team and we look forward to staying at the hotel again. Also don't forget you get a free breakfast which just concludes your stay with a full belly  =)"
1398,824paulmrb,2017-03-31,4.0,Good but some technical hiccups Overall facilities and service was great. Just was not able to sleep without several beers with the noisy aircon. Was also unable to pay with company AMEX. Also back entrance to hotel also broke down. Once this new hotel resolves these teething problems. I will wholeheartedly recommend it.
1399,C8293YGkeithh,2017-03-31,2.0,Business visit Stayed here recently on a business trip.  From start to finish very poor.  The hotel looks good but was freezing.  Rooms are nice and do the job.  Ventured down stairs for some bar food which was terrible and half an hour late.  Again downstairs was freezing staff really poor.  Didn't get any better for breakfast!!
1400,T0Mtom,2017-02-28,5.0,"Location for connecting at Bristol airport, comfortable, quite, clean, tidy, customer friendly - Ideally located to connect flight at Bristol airport with a 2 minutes walk only.
- Ideal to rest a few hours between flights or before hitting the road the next morning.
- Yet the rooms are very quiet.
- I stayed overnight in room 118, it was nice and tidy, it looked like it had just been refurbished, compact yet comfortable.
- Good light in the bedroom. 
- There is free wifi internet access, yet I cannot rate since I have not used it.
- The room appeared extremely clean, well done cleaners!
- The staff are totally customer focused and make sure that you are going to have a positive experience.
- Very supportive mattress enabled me to get good rest over just 5 hours sleep.
- Quality linens.
- Very nice and easy to use shower.
- The soaps / shampoo / conditioners form dispensers are of high quality and nice fragrance.
- The breakfast is comprehensive with a lot of choice of hot and cold foods and drinks.
- I could not find any fault  
- I highly recommend."
1401,caseyjDESIGN,2017-02-28,5.0,"Very impressed. Highly recommend.  Stayed at this brand new hotel a few nights after they opened. I don't think our room had been used once before our arrival. Everything was in perfect condition. Staff, though clearly still training, were welcoming and kind. I was particularly impressed with the fact that they open (free!) breakfast at 4 am for those taking early flights. Speaking of flights, this hotel's location a 3 minute walk to airport is perfect. We walked over in the evening to check in early for our flights the next day. Then we returned so smoothly in morning without worrying about traffic delays or anything at all. I highly recommend this Hotel if you have an early flight out of Bristol. I'm very impressed."
1402,Sian1987,2017-02-28,4.0,"Teething problems but good  We stayed at this hotel before a flight 2 days after it opened. Check in was very slow as they were having problems with their computers. The rooms are basic and 'compact' but have the facilities needed for a 1 night stay before a flight. 

We went down to the bar and soon realised there were 3 girls trying to cover reception, the bar and restaurant. Not really fair as their tills kept crashing and they were getting flustered.  Not their fault, they were nice and friendly and we're doing their best.

Should be a nice hotel once the teething problems are sorted out."
1403,davidjR7396GR,2017-02-28,5.0,"On Airport nearest hotel Opened Feb 22 2017. Newly built . The nearest hotel a stroll Contemporary , functional and user friendly. A pleasant light & welcoming  atmosphere. Friendly check in staff  especially Anna who went out of her way to look after us. Comfortable rooms are well decorated air conditioned quiet and free from aircraft noise. Bathrooms with large shower area.
A bar and restaurant serve 24 hour light food from a very limited menu. 

24 hour fitness area.

Bristol airport has poor access roads with many delays. The city suffers horrendous traffic delays with endless unfinished road works so travellers beware and plan ahead.

 I recommend travellers with morning flights stay here overnight relieving stress whilst ensuring not missing a flight .

Ideal for business. Meetings. Family."

We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we entered the hotel and shown to a lovely window table in the restaurant. We were looked after by the wonderful Marta who was so helpful without being too intrusive, Marta is a real star. A lovely selection of sandwiches, cakes and scones and we were even provided with some boxes to take home several cakes which we didn't manage to eat. A wonderful experience, many thanks to everyone involved."

Buffet breakfast is lovely and the restaurant I have used on a few occasions for evening meals.
The thing I love about the bar in the hotel is Chakir who works the bar most weekends.
He is so lovely and welcoming and even remembers what my preferred drink choice is when I am staying.
Big comfy beds, clean bathrooms
Only criticism is try not to get a room on the 3rd floor if you are working as this seems to be the party revellers floor that are having a Saturday night out in Bristol so it can be a bit noisy"

Good location, although roadworks make access difficult for now. Why does TA insist on 200 characters, I don't have much else to say about this decent property."

47,Trip525910,2024-03-31,4.0,Good for a weekend away in Bristol Comfortable rooms with good facilities but bit cramped. Need more hooks for wet coats etc. Friendly service especially front desk staff and Arc in the restaurant. Breakfast good especially the freshly made waffles. Parking welcome but very expensive at £20 per 24hrs.
48,Expedition820826,2024-03-31,4.0,"Nice stay but little pricey Arc and the rest of the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was very good, however slightly reduced during the week (the waffle machine was not operational).
The hotel is in need of repairs, one elevator was not working and there was no air con in the room (reception offered to change rooms or get a portable heater).
Good location between the train station and the centre.
Overall we had a nice stay, although it's priced for a 4* hotel, it didn't quite feel like one."
49,janieCrawleyUk,2024-03-31,3.0,"Good location but very busy When we checked in there was also very large groups on city breaks which meant there was no access to restaurant from 6.30- 8-30 for two nights . 
There was just 4 tables in the bar so we sat there . 
On the 2 nd night we were told we didn’t need to reserve a table in the bar but found all tables reserved so we sat and ate anyway . 
Other hotel guests were turned away . Very bad show after a long day and nowhere to eat .  So beware if large groups are in hotel you will probably have to go out . 
The rooms are quite small and not even a coat hook to hang wet coats on . 
The fridge is in an awful place . The cupboard door opens one way and the fridge door the other which was fun !  
In a great location though but at the front there is a lot of traffic noise if you have the window open .  
Breakfast was a great choice and the servers were great . But once again with the large groups eating breakfast it was very very busy . 
The stairs were a bonus to use as one of the lifts were out of order . 
Beautiful park out the back and easy  access to shops"
50,moX8167XN,2024-03-31,5.0,"Staff can’t do enough to help Very comfy pillows and bed, handy fridge in room and cold-infused water in lobby changing daily (orange, Lemon&mint).

The only criticism I can provide of the stay is perhaps the size of the bathroom and the position of the toilet making it difficult to use for the larger person.

Apart from that, a fantastic stay!"

Reception staff were engaging and friendly and checking in was quick and easy.

Room was sufficient. It was comfy enough for 1 nights sleep as somewhere to get your head down. A little rough around some edges but nothing bad enough to complain about.

Breakfast was very good. On arriving to the restaurant, we were greeted by Arc who was friendly and informative. Love a big smile in the morning!!! 

All in all, a really good stay. Would come again and would recommend."

The staining isn’t obtrusive so it’s more aesthetic than an actual issue hence me not bothering to raise it. Also there’s a spacious mini fridge which was helpful. 

The reception staff were very welcoming and friendly and somehow the main atrium smells amazing almost like a really nice aftershave which I really enjoyed. 

I opted for breakfast to be included and was very pleased with it, their English breakfast was delightful, properly cooked and flavourful. The only critique I had was for the pastries as they were a bit tough, perhaps a tad over baked but still edible and they go down well with a cup of coffee. They also have coffee syrups available which I greatly appreciated, not a lot of places bother with them but I love them so was pleased. 

I had two people serve me during breakfast, Navi and Priya, they were so welcoming and attentive, made sure I had everything I needed and were swift to remove finished plates. I felt very well looked after.

Overall I’ve enjoyed my stay here and look forward to returning next time! 

Thanks for having me! 😊"

129,kellyhL2175YJ,2023-12-31,3.0,"Overall ok but would not come back  Overall nice stay clean hotel and polite front of house staff. 

Room was smaller than expected for a queen room and the price attached to it. Creaky bed and a strange fousty smell which we think came from the air vents.

Breakfast was nice. Simple and easy. 

Evening staff in the restaurant clearly did not want to be there but the morning staff were lovely.

Disappointing for the price paid. Would not stay again."
130,DawnD828,2023-12-31,4.0,"Nice stay Nicely placed hotel close to town centre.  Staff at check in and out lovely.  Friendly.
Room fine except the A/C fan was flipping noisy!!  Nice toiletries. Shame there is no complimentary biscuits with tea tray!!
Breakfast very good. Poached eggs are ordered at the time you request and are perfect.
No butter, ham ran out but rest good.
Parking should be free as £20.00 expensive but seems to be the norm these days!
Why does the bar close so early?  Also, small bottles of prosecco needed as large bottle was only option.
Would stay again."

The location is perfect for a stop-over before catching a flight, because it’s just a stone throw away from the train station where one can catch the airport flyer. We received a warm and friendly welcome from Annie on reception. Our room was clean, warm, and we had everything we needed. We enjoyed our breakfast at the restaurant. Our host, Arc, was polite and attentive. He made sure that we had everything we needed. Overall, this was a great experience and we will definitely stay again if we are in Bristol."

The hotel refused to do anything when we requested, noting that we booked this hotel as they advertise EV chargers. There was also a loud party going on. We asked for a room as far away as possible but they still they put us directly above the noise. This is only understandable if the hotel was fully booked. Will not be using this hotel again."

Rooms clean, with refreshments and all amenities.  Due to road closures, one-way systems and driving around an unfamiliar city in the dark, I couldn’t find the hotel car park so I called the hotel and Annie was like a Christmas guardian angel, she was so patient and helpful personally guiding me to the hotel and then when I arrived she greeted me with a wonderful smile and a complimentary drink from the bar - customer service has deteriorated over the years but Annie’s was first class and I wanted to personally recognise her and thank her from the bottom of my heart for her amazing customer service 💖💖"
161,698ka,2023-12-31,1.0,"Avoid at all costs. Everything else was fine apart from the Friday evening, after coming back to the hotel from dinner and drinks, the hotel had music absolutely blaring all through the hotel down in the bar and restaurant.

This went on for 2-3 hours and didn’t finish until 12am…

Really unnecessary with how loud it was, we were not impressed and essentially had a really crap sleep due to this. 

I’d recommend not going on a weekend as you will get no sleep!!

167,337michaelm,2023-11-30,5.0,"All ready for Christmas What can I say, this hotel delivers where others don’t. Credit to the new management team is due where all the staff in this hotel make the guests there no1 priority, the ambiance they give out with their warming smiles is ama img to see.

There continuous effort from reception to the f@b staff with Subash and Patricia, cleaners and the Night team is applaudable.

The rooms are not the biggest but they serve there purpose, with the large TV’s, walk in showers and a desk for your business requirements. My room was spotlessly clean and my bed remade every day which I did not expect.

Breakfast- In the past I have criticised this but this now seems to be resolved with fresh hot breakfast with plenty of choices for croissants, fruit and cereal along with all your Juices. The coffee is supplied by machine with various types of hot drinks available.

Dinner has gone up a notch too, despite the new staff who are very welcoming, I was honoured when the Chef called Aimee personally delivered my delicious dinner to the table, what a personal touch! Food was delicious in flavour with great presentation.

The Bar with Ethan , what a polite gentleman was quick and efficient too.

My check in and out, Is far better than any other hotel with that warm personal touch from Annie, Juan and Peter and the rest of the team.

The complimentary gym is a small gym but served me brilliantly for my purpose, A couple of bikes and a treadmill with a weight set.

The Christmas decorations look great! 

Thank you for an Amazing stay."

170,Maxschichi,2023-11-30,5.0,"An almost perfect hotel What a delightful stay we four old school friends had at this hotel. The hotel is situated within easy walking distance from the railway station and in a slightly longer walk to the town (but still walkable). Our twin room was fairly small and the bathroom was very small. However, they had everything necessary for a good night's sleep - a comfortable bed, excellent toiletries. The only time the size was a problem was when  the four of us wanted to meet in our room for a chat and there was no room to sit except on the beds.  The lounge/bar area could also benefit from more comfy chairs. The best part of our stay was the wonderful breakfast - the best buffet I have seen in a long time and poached eggs or an omelette cooked to order. Wonderful. I must mention Ash (Subash?). He made a big effort to ensure we were comfortable and had everything we needed, both at breakfast and later in the day when we were chatting near reception. He's a star. 
All in all this is an almost perfect place to stay and  would definitely book again if I'm in the Bristol area."

Maria on reception is also lovely and very helpful, this is our first choice when we come to Bristol."
172,PEDROWINE,2023-11-30,2.0,"Lost their chance Room was small and smelly. Noisy. And over tiny beds. I cannot see a well-built person sleeping in such a tiny bed or taking a shower in a ridiculously small bathroom.

What made me specially angry was their check in policy. I am well aware that rooms need to be cleaned but I guarantee that the hotel was not full and the lady in reception did not let me check in before their official time. She was obviously busy when I arrived and showed zero friendliness and readiness to help.

Too many other hotels in Bristol."

The personnel in general was friendly.
The points are deducted mainly for the quality of the food at breakfast, wine, which was sour (as a person who has good knowledge of wine), and the facilities, for example the hair dryer's tip was melted and we were afraid to get electric shock while drying our hair.
The mattress and pillows were very uncomfortable."

The breakfast was great. I like to eat well in the morning so I can power through to dinner. That starts with Yogurt, nuts and fruit, then poached eggs with bacon on toast. 
The hotel is in a great location, close to Cabot Circle shopping center and an easy walk into town.

The rooms and facilities are of the highest quality. The restaurant staff were faced a with similar volume of guests wishing to dine, and again handled this situation in a seamless manner.

No issues with the room or the bathroom although I do prefer a harder pillow than the super soft ones provided.

My only criticism of the place is how they automatically add 10% service charge to the restaurant AND then also ask for a gratuity.  Easy to miss the 10% charge on the bill when there is a large space lower down for you to also write in a gratuity.  This feels like sharp practice to me so I thought I would share it on here for people to make their own decision on the policy (or maybe for the hotel to defend it)."
187,geoffreyj169,2023-09-30,4.0,"Misleading information on hotel website I was staying in Bristol overnight and wanted to recharge my EV hybrid car whilst parked overnight. I chose this hotel partly because of the location and because the website states ""Electric Vehicle Charging Points Free To Use When Paying To Use The Car Park"". To me this implies that you can recharge your EV free of charge if you have paid the £20 overnight car park fee. This is not the case. You will be charged the standard rate per KWh as shown on the BP Pulse EV charger - currently £0.79 per KWh for a Type 2 connection. I have complained to Hilton and suggested that the website should make it clear that charges still apply"
188,Rx8231,2023-09-30,2.0,"Just Poor Parking is on site, however it is extortionate at £20 per night when it is free between 6pm and 8am if you pay online rather than in the hotel.

Three members of staff behind the desk, check in still takes an age. Had to spend 10 minutes whilst the member of staff figured out that I didnt have to pay for the room as the business had already paid it but was adamant that I needed to pay. Once she had sorted that without any sort of apology whilst making me wait 10 minutes and show her a number of emails I finally got the key which didnt work so back downstairs to get that resolved.

Air con does not work, the room was absolutely boiling.

Will not stay again and instead stick to the Moxy whose rooms are so much better, air con works and parking is half the price or less."

The room was small (as was the bathroom) but well furnished with plenty of storage if you'd needed it. My biggest grumble would be there was no choice of pillows (they were all very soft which I struggled with). I also struggled to have a hot shower as the water kept going cold throughout. There was a good selection of hot and cold products available at breakfast. I had a meal in the onsite restaurant, which was nice, but expensive at £22 for a chicken burger and non-alcoholic drink."

Reception lady said she'd come tell us when room ready altho she didn't!  When we checked out we weren't asked if we'd had good stay or if everything was ok which I found strange.

Rooms - very basic and furniture old fashioned needs an upgrade. Beds were very firm gave my partner back ache. No nice toiletries or vanity set in the bathroom and our room wasn’t cleaned during the stay. Does the job but for the money you’d expect more. Not up to the usual Hilton standard.

The location is great as we visited the quay and Wapping wharf. The staff were friendly and the reception area and restaurant are lovely. The only negatives for me were the extremely firm mattresses which meant I woke up in pain as o have arthritis in my back. Also the bathroom was very small with various bottles of products (shower gel , shampoo etc) glued to the wall which kept falling off. Not really 4 star bathroom ! At the time of our visit there was a lot of road closures in Bristol so we couldn’t find the car park entrance , this needs signposting clearly by Hilton in the end we went down a one way street to get in after driving round 3 times!"

A small buffet breakfast was available, with poached or omelette cooked to order. For dinner, the service was good (the waiter was attentive and good care was taken over allergy requirements) - the pizza however was a bit doughy, and the lighting was exceptionally bright thus ruining the ambience.

The condition of the bathroom in the first room allocated was not in keeping with a Hilton - dripping plumbing in the shower cubicle, broken soap dispenser and a stained toilet seat. Upon raising with reception, they capably resolved the matter with a change of room and provided a complementary drink from the bar whilst I waited. 

The main issue was the sleep quality - one of the least comfortable mattresses I've ever slept on (I stay in hotels 2 months per year) and given the noises from the springs clearer long overdue for replacing. Air conditioning was noisy and did little to cool the room, with only a small window partially opening as an alternative. I was not asked how my stay was on departure.

As sleep quality and housekeeping standards are non-negotiable for me, I wouldn't recommend a stay."

The rooms are compact but adequate. Housekeeping a tad patchy, waste bin (almost overflowing) not emptied however more disappointing was the breakfast offering.

Day 1 the hotel appeared not to be very busy and a lot of food had been cooked and left under heat lamps for what appeared to be a long time. Consequently the bacon was extremely tough and the fried eggs together with the sausages, hash browns and baked beans were well past their best.

Day 2 the hotel was much busier and there was a higher turnover of the breakfast items improving the overall offering to OK.

For me, part of the hotel experience is the good old full English so from this experience I would not plan to revisit."

The rooms are tiny, basic and dated, but reasonable for the price and location. Air con was very noisy, and you can only over ride it for about 30 mins before it kicks back in - which woke me up a few times in the night. In the morning, reception told me they could have remotely switched it off had I called down - fair enough. I was just trying not to wake up too much. 
One of the soap bottles fell off the wall in the bathroom in the small hours, which also woke me up (they are just held on with a sticky pad). 
The beds are extremely firm. Pillows and duvet are heavenly and there is a good selection of pillows of different firmness. 
There's a knack to getting in the shower as the doors open onwards into the shower. It took me a few goes to work it out as the door was quite stiff. The door wouldn't stay shut while showering."

Breakfast next morning was absolutely wonderful and what a cheerful chef they have Boba. I think he is his name
My parking and breakfast was also complimentary for the mixup
This post is not about how to get free things. It is about the kindness of staff going extra mile like Bailey and Victoria on reception.
I really had had a terrible day, and their kindness was most appreciated
It is also to say that when things go wrong, they apologise and put it right, which was the polar opposite of my experience at the Marriot the week before

The bar and restaurant serve quality food and drink and there is parking on site too (chargeable). Staff are professional and efficient. I also liked the outside terrace at fe back of the hotel to enjoy a quiet drink with the sun setting over the city.
 
My only criticism of the hotel is that because it sits on a main road was the noise from the front and that the A/C was ineffective. Despite the window being shut road noise is still there and if you’re a light sleeper you may be affected.

The A/C control instructions didn’t match the controller in my room and whilst the fan was blowing and thermo down it simply didn’t effect the temperature and in the end it was just too noisy and I switched it off.

I wouldn’t choose this hotel on a warm Bristol night."

The rooms are clean and the beds are soft and comfy. You have also been supplied with all the products to clean with like shampoo, conditioner, hand wash and even body lotion.

To be fair the lady on reception was great on arrival and very friendly.

Got a room on the third floor at the back of the hotel so it was quiet.

The rooms are much smaller than Premier Inn and the bathroom is really tiny.

The worst thing of all was the beds. It was a twin room and it wasn’t until returning much later in the evening that I got in bed and realised how very uncomfortable both beds were. They were really rock solid and creaked at every movement. My back and hip were aching from lying on the bed so I had to lay on a pillow which wasn’t ideal but at least gave relief from the mattress. I thought about going to reception but it was late and as I was only staying one night I couldn’t face trying to move rooms.  Didn’t have a good night at all.

Tried the fitness centre which was reasonably well equipped but no instructions on how to use the machines which would have been helpful.

When I left no one on reception asked how my stay was which I thought was incredible.

Didn’t try the bar or restaurant so can’t comment on these but based on this stay I won’t be going back to this hotel as it was very disappointing. 

To me the room should be built around the bed and this must be the most comfortable feature. Sadly Hilton failed miserably in this regard."

Room needs a makeover and should not be made available to guest until it has been done
Various shades of white paint does not look good, paint the whole room do not just touch up.
Hanging rail in wardrobe had dust on it
Arm on the writing desk chair was damaged making it look ugly
Ceiling in shower area paint was peeling off
And finally there was poo in the toilet bowl

Not ideal when you when you want an early night.

Modern, comfortable and spotlessly clean room. Efficient and friendly staff at check-in. The parking charge is a bit steep but I guess it's normal in the city centre. My only minor criticism - given that the room appeared to be recently renovated, the lack of USB charging by the bedside was odd. Driving to the hotel was hugely frustrating - do NOT attempt to navigate to it using the main hotel address! There is no vehicle access from Temple Way, which has clearly been designed to frustrate drivers as much as possible with ""no turn"" restrictions everywhere and absurd one-way systems everywhere. Navigate to ""Temple Rose Street"" instead which will take you to the car park entrance at the rear of the hotel."

Our room was fairly small but was modern, quiet and had a nice view over the park.

The safe was closed when we arrived so we couldn’t use it the first day we stayed. The gentleman on reception did offer to stow our valuables in the hotel’s safe though. There was a small window in our room which did not close properly. And unfortunately our fridge didn’t work either.

One thing I missed was hotel information. There was nothing in the room, I’m guessing because of Covid. I had to ring reception to find out what time breakfast was.

It also offers parking, although for an extra charge of £16/24hrs, which we thought was competitive and more secure than leaving the car in a public car park. The king rooms are well appointed with plenty of storage and a mini fridge, good shower and Crabtree & Evelyn separate shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, unlike the one-bottle-cleans-all approach in similar chain hotels. The hotel sits by a major road but the sound proofing is great and the rooms are airconditioned. The public spaces are pleasant and choice at breakfast is extensive, including full English, cold meats and cheeses, fresh fruit, porridge and a waffle-making machine! Overall we felt our overnight stay with breakfast was good value."
254,JRMADA,2022-09-30,2.0,"Hotel Staff = A+  Hotel Maintenance = F The elevators did not work when we checked in, so had to drag luggage to 4th floor… Yay!!!! Then had to change rooms twice before we got one with working air conditioning. Yay!!!! Our room had breakfast included, but had to pay an extra 3.95 to get a cappuccino, since Hilton’s breakfast coffee machines are rubbish in all the hotels we’ve been to around the world. We’ve had less problems at Ibis when we stayed in them. We book Hilton as last resort because there are always problems with the rooms. The staff is lovely and they make up for the shortcomings with the rooms/building/equipment. In this place Peter and Viktoria were great help and made us feel like we were important customers. I hope the company rewards them accordingly as they are true assets to the Hilton brand. The location is convenient (near city center and train station), but the rooms look tired, and the maintenance issues are very disappointing. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. The restaurant is just OK. The food is average. We would have a hard justification staying here again."
255,AmericaHolidaylover,2022-09-30,4.0,"Good location I agree with previous reviews the rooms definitely need updating however they are functional,, beds are real comfortable & shower is fab. Negative is the parking. Not enough spaces. Did manage to park on the crisscross parts right next to the hotel. Cost of £16 on top of what I’d paid for the room seems a lot. Hotel location is really good & luckily I didn’t need my car, could walk everywhere (good job really as I think I would of lost my parking space if I’d used my car) 
All in all would return to this hotel if ever back in Bristol."
256,grahame745,2022-09-30,5.0,"As usual - excellent. A great location, a comfortable, quiet room, excellent service and a fantastic breakfast. Parking was chargeable which surprised me but it is very convenient and a few minutes to walk into the city centre."

I was happy with my room which, while not huge, was lovely, clean and comfortable. The hotel was by a busy road which is an issue if you sleep with your window open. However, with the window (and inner window) closed, you don't hear the traffic. We ate in the restaurant and the food tasty and well presented. The hotel is literally a few minutes (5 at the most) from Bristol Temple Meads station and also a short walk into the centre. I would definitely stay there again."
258,Balltasticvoyage,2022-09-30,3.0,"Ufely average considering it's a Hilton Room was really nice but small. No iron or board so not ideal considering I was there for business. Small bathroom and only a shower.

Bar wasn't cheap at all, a single whiskey and a pint was £13, but the thing that caught my attention was the breakfast. It was just not that great at all, probably on par with a spoons. 

I chose egg on toast and the eggs were cold. Coffee machine had powdered milk in it so was a bit minging. Pastries were hard and the fruit was sour. A bit of a let down on that front!

Desk staff and bar staff however were nothing but nice and friendly."

Shelf at the back of the bed, Shelf between beds, sockets, TV. Not good when they are supposed to be wiping down with anti-bac between visits!!   Milk for tea was soured and lumpy, reception replaced this,  SHower gel dispenser was empty, which would have been ok had I not left my own gel in my case on the luggage stand. On a good note, the bathroom was clean. The staff were very pleasant and the food was tasty."
261,W5059KEdaniele,2022-09-30,1.0,"Unclean and expected more from a Hilton Hotel. Very disappointed with this hotel to be honest seriously expected more from a Hilton hotel, a travel lodge would have been better. 

Firstly there’s nowhere to park, not nearly enough spaces for such a large hotel, had to go in and ask where to park and in the end the lady at the check in desk told us to just park in the electric car charging station and the next morning people were parked up against the kerb next to the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful which is probably the only benefit to this hotel. Walked in the room and it was… underwhelming for a Hilton but I don’t really mind about that. 

As an honors member when I usually stay in Hilton hotel’s the beds are usually very comfortable however this one was not, very boxy and hard had an almost cardboard top feel to it, and if you plan on staying here I hope you like ultra soft pillows that sink to the level of the matress when you put your head on them.

Now for the reason I wrote this review. The bathroom definately had not been cleaned properly, there was facial hair on top of the shavers socket and on the silicone holding the tiles to the wall which I have attached pictures for. As for the toilet, well let’s just say the bottom of it looked like brands hatch race circuit. I didn’t say anything at the time since I was only staying 1 night and was leaving very early in the morning but I knew straight away I’d write this review! 

Overall very disappointed and expected much better from a Hilton hotel!"
262,F5149VWallanw,2022-08-31,1.0,"Time to find another hotel This hotel simply cannot cope. We stay here a lot (on average every other week) because it is right opposite our office. But we’re going to find somewhere else (Holiday Inn most likely). The beds here are crippling (can hardly stand straight in the mornings), my room has not been cleaned or restocked (it’s 6pm) but the biggest problem is the restaurant. Last night they had a big party in so was told couldn’t eat in the restaurant. Tonight they have another big party in but they cannot serve anyone else any food. That is ludicrous for a City Centre hotel aimed primarily at business people. What do they expect guests to do - order take out? Cannot fault the staff, they are doing the best they can but the hotel needs to take a long hard look at itself. At the very least they should tell you when you check in there is no food at the Inn."
263,SS6226,2022-08-31,3.0,"Not a great experience for a Hilton.. Sadly not a great experience at all for a Hilton, where I expected much more including basics. The fridge in the room did not work, and with it being so hot we wanted to put drinks in there. We then could not find the TV remote, this was missing from the room. We did get another one from reception, but there was nothing they could do about the fridge at that time."
264,KayBee80,2022-08-31,2.0,"Noisy, uncomfortably hot and poor food The hotel is very dated and of equal (if not worse) quality to a Travelodge or Premier Inn. The room was very run down and the air conditioning did not work at all making the room stuffy and unbearably hot. The window opened slightly but the hotel faces on to a main road and there was a lot of building works going on around the hotel so we were unable to leave the window open for any period of time. The breakfast was very poor quality and the bed was terribly uncomfortable.

Overall, not really what we were expecting for the price paid and the fact that it is a Hilton branded hotel. Add on to that the cost of £16 for a nights parking and it was unfortunately a huge let down. We would not stay here again, there are so many better choices in Bristol."

268,Chariotchoogle,2022-07-31,4.0,"Another Great weekend In Bristol Got off to a bad start, air conditioning was kaput a trickle of hot air in a room that probably hadn’t cooled down from the hottest temperatures on record, the first night of four night stay was horrendous. However the hotel did sort it pretty quickly once reported and the remainder of our stay was pretty comfortable.
Forth time staying here, perfect place for a break, close to the train station, bus routes to Bath and Wells, and a ten minute walk in to town, perfect location.
Rooms have everything you need, iron, safe and fridge, great comfy bedding and super shower. Room cleaning seems back to normal, immaculately cleaned every day.
Staff are super friendly, always polite and professional.
Breakfast is pretty good, everything you need, great coffee, and now a waffle making machine which was a treat. Nice bar area to have a pre going out drink especially on the terrace outside.
Would have got 5 stars if it wasn’t for the air conditioning, but it became a distant memory and once again the Hilton added to another great weekend break in Bristol, thank you, see you in 2023."
269,padsmcginty62,2022-07-31,4.0,"Got off to a shaky start. This was the fourth time we have used this hotel and when we tried to enter our allocated room the key cards wouldn't work and then when we entered the room we were immediately hit by the heat. The air conditioning was on and I put it on the lowest setting and then we went out. When we arrived back the room was boiling so obviously the air conditioning wasn't working. We had a dreadful night's sleep so much so that I went down at 6am to complain. We went to Wells for the day and when we came back a maintenance guy was just finishing repairing the air conditioning. Our thanks to him and after that we had no further problems with the temperature. Also there was no TV remote but someone from housekeeping sorted us out with one later that day.
Everything else was fine and it would have been a 5 star review if it wasn't for the issue with the air conditioning."

Check in was very efficient with a nice friendly guy and I was in my room in no time. I was on the 5th floor and I couldn’t hear any noise from outside. The room was typical Garden Inn but I did think it was a bit smaller than other Garden Inn’s I’ve been in. It wasn’t really an issue though. 

Breakfast next morning was well organised and the guy on the egg station was superb, really friendly and chatty. A real credit to the hotel.

Overall, I really liked this hotel and would recommend."
272,beaconoutbound16,2022-05-31,2.0,"Noisy hotel, rock hard bed Front desk staff hit and miss. The lady named Brittany was really friendly but the older gentleman in the suit spoke to us in a condescending and grumpy manner. During the first night the air conditioning kept switching itself off, making the room uncomfortably hot. The next morning we went down to the front desk to ask for it to be repaired, and whilst there asked for our room to be made up by housekeeping. Said grumpy man then steps in (despite not talking to him), seems annoyed and starts actually lecturing us on how the hotel is now back to “full service” and that our room will automatically get cleaned by housekeeping as long as the do not disturb sign is not hung up. He kept repeating this over and over again, practically forcing me to apologise for disturbing the front desk before he got off his high horse. 

So we took him at his demeaning word, and the next day did not stop by the front desk to request housekeeping. We come back at the end of the day to find our room has not been made up by housekeeping despite the do not disturb sign being off our door when we vacated the room for the day at around noon. Annoying. 

The room itself does have a fridge, but other than that is small and pretty basic in terms of furnishings. Super powerful shower. Beds are rock-hard, as other reviewers have noted. Housekeeping staff were pretty noisy (chatting, shouting down their phones, clanking, and continually slamming doors shut of the rooms they’re cleaning), waking us up every morning during our stay.

Beware if you go for a (more expensive) “park view” room that there is a building directly opposite which has demolition work ongoing, with the associated noises. 

Final note; there are EV charging points, but these were occupied by non-EV vehicles every night."
273,26lucyc,2022-07-31,5.0,"Perfect Location and warm welcoming staff Stayed here a night before office and already booked my next visit back.

Great value for money in terms of quality of accommodation and staff friendliness. Location was exactly where I needed and only 25 min walk from Cabot Tower which i highly recommend going up for brilliant views. The room I had originally picked wasn't quite ready so they offered to move me into a different room (507). Lots of space in hotel room and mattress was great for a good night sleep. Room was also extremely clean and staff obviously took a lot of care. 

Only one downside is that there wasn't a TV remote in room to be able to watch Wimbledon. Went down to front desk and they sorted me straight out and found me a remote.  

Can't fault a single thing."

Parking outside hotel cost £16 for 24 hr period.

I have to congratulate manager regarding his staff...... everyone was extremely pleasant, cheerful and professional..... as it should be. It really does make a difference. 

My only gripe would be the breakfast. I did not book breakfast in advance as I was not sure how I would be feeling in the morning. Breakfast booked in advance is £9.99, however, if you go in on the morning it is charged at £14. I have had better breakfasts at other Hilton Garden Inns..... breakfast would be okay for £9.99..... it is overpriced at £14."

Restaurant - food ok in parts but fish looks sub standard quality and very bony. Check if there are any coach parties due in as about 20ish people descend all of a sudden and take over the seating area.

Room - ok, a little small as was the bathroom but toiletries nice and seemed clean. Asked for more milk and was offered the box to take however many I needed, unlike some places that give you a measly 4.

Overall, I wouldn't rule out staying again, maybe just consider other dining options - oh and they add a service charge too which I personally loathe, I always leave a tip but dislike being dictated how much."

280,NeilC2607,2022-06-30,4.0,"bathroom tight squeeze Reception:
Pleasent and very helpful efficient staff

Room / facilities:
Room number 528 is on the 5th floor and is clean with a green park view,  the room contains a queen bed, 4 pillows (none of which were to my liking), hanging area, small bar fridge, safe, iron and board, tea and coffee facilities, desk and chair and single chair. The room is cosy and the bathroom is very cramped and poorly designed.
We had house keeping knock on our door at 8.30am, when she was aware we were to check out (but had not yet) and were due to check out by 11.00am.

Another staff member was in the lift as it arrived on our floor.  She quickly tried to close the door before we could enter the lift.

The room does have self control air conditioning with a window that opens 3 cm.

Laundry: 
Self service coin laundry with 1 washers and 1 dryers costing £1.20 per wash and dry is  £0.20 per 12 mins 

Parking:
Parking is plentiful for about 30 cars and costs £16 per night. Car registration is required at checkin. 
We arrived back to the hotel at 3.30pm after a day out, and there was only 2 car spaces left (seperate to the 3 electric car charge stations).  Having paid a hefty price for parking and to not be able to find park, is unacceptable.  The hotel staff confirmed that the hotel does over book car parking to the level where cars park in non designated car spaces, and almost lock other vehicles in.

Wifi:
Complementary and good speed. No validation or password required.

Breakfast:
Available for additional cost, but not utilised on this stay.

Conclusion:
Great location and staff, close to city centre.

Letdowns:
Small bathroom, possibility of not having a car park upon your return in the afternoon/evening, window that does not open more.

Location / Nearby:
Bristol city and all its offerings are a close 10 min stroll.
Tesco express market and Pret a Manger coffee within a 4 minute walk.

Beware:
No matter where you drive to, payment for parking is required. Most parking meters accept coin and card “tap” facilities. Generally after 6.00pm or 8.00pm parking is free, in designated locations.

Getting to hotel:
Best use GPS"
281,O6983MXelizabetha,2022-05-31,5.0,"Cannot fault this hotel We were on a coach trip staying overnight at the Hilton Garden Inn. I arrived at around 5.00 p.m. and our driver went in to check us all in. Some rooms weren't ready so we were all invited to go into the bar for a complimentary drink until we could go to our rooms..  The dinner which was served buffet style for our coach party only, and was excellent with a good choice on the menu.  My room was quite chilly on arrival due to the air conditioning and I couldn't change it. I spoke to Reception and asked if they could switch it off.   They were very apologetic and said they would do that and would I like a heater delivered to my room? Or, if I preferred I could change rooms.   I was quite happy to just have it turned off.  However, after dinner I was in my room when a very nice young lady delivered a heater in case I needed it and again, offered to change my room which I declined.  Breakfast was again buffet style with plenty of choice.  All the staff were absolutely lovely and extremely helpful.  We went out for a walk in the evening and the situation of the hotel is quite nice with a park opposite and you are not far from the river.  I would certainly recommend this hotel and once again a big thank you to the lovely staff."

289,chelseapeter25,2022-04-30,5.0,"Our Favourite Hotel My partner and I chose this hotel for our April 'just because' stay and it was brilliant. We got a discount for signing up to the Hilton Honours programme directly on their website, making it £253 for 3 nights, which we were happy to pay. Not only was the good price one of our main reasons for choosing it, but also because the location was fantastic. We downloaded the app and were given the opportunity to check in the day before, as well as having easy access to lists of facilities and recommendations etc. 

Upon our arrival, we used the app to check-in early and choose a room, but unfortunately the room we picked wasn't available as it was yet to be cleaned (note we got there at 12, when check-in is 3!). They gave us the choice of them picking another random room, or for us to come back later, which was what we did. They looked after our luggage for a few hours whilst we went to explore. When we came back to check in, our room still wasn't available due to maintenance so they gave us an alternative. The staff member who organised this was incredibly helpful and spent a long time going over a map of Bristol with us, giving various recommendations. 

When we got to the room (second floor), we were pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious, clean and well-stocked with facilities. The bed was a good size, with the TV directly across from it. The room was well lit despite being next to a building on the other side of the road. Everything felt premium quality. The bed was a little hard but we both slept well every night we were there. The only issue we encountered in the room was the TV; the time set on the TV was different to the actual time, meaning the TV guide was completely out of sync and unusable. Although this was a hassle, we were able to use the Freeview TV guide on their website instead to match everything up, so it wasn't a disaster, more an inconvenience. 

Our location was absolutely fantastic. As it is tucked away, it is not too noisy and you get a pleasant walk through the park when going into the centre. On the other side of the hotel there is a bus stop that goes directly to the zoo. It's only a 15 minute max walk into the centre and it is pleasant any time of day. You walk past so many food places on the way and Tescos etc, so you're always able to be well stocked. 

We could not fault our stay. I would have said 4.8 instead of 5 to account for the TV issue but as this was not an option and I feel so positively about our experience, a 5 point rating seems the most appropriate score. If it weren't for us trying new places, we would definitely return to the hotel! Perhaps in future if we feel we want to experience the same quality as we did for our short trip. All staff we encountered were fantastic and we felt safe and comfortable there. It was the ideal hotel for our first trip to Bristol."

This was by far my best stay over the last 2 years, all the staff are amazing starting with Annie checking me in.

It was great to meet the new reception manager Alex and Juan who went out of their way to make me feel welcome throughout the week.

The rooms aren’t massive but very comfy but are plenty big enough for 2 people and copious room for working with all the amenities you need. But they have a great bathroom and the rooms and hotel are spotless!

The food at Breakfast and Dinner has only got better and better with the lovely David and Karla and Mario and the chefs who assist when needed treating their guests with abundance of energy and warmth.

My check out by Peter was excellent as always and worked like clockwork.

The lovely patio area is starting to fill as the days get warmer.

A special shout out to the young cleaner on the 2nd floor who went out of her way to say good morning and asking how my stay was, this was a first and started my day off in a great mood - Thank you.

For the first time it was great to see the hotel practice their fire evacuation and this seemed very smooth with no issues.

Liked · There was a warm and genuine welcome from Bailey at reception, and we given all the info we needed on breakfast / dining and checkout etc. Reception was filled with the most wonderful fragrance too.
The room was immaculately clean, very well laid out with plenty of storage. Having a fridge was a real benefit too for milk and cold drinks.
Although compact the bathroom had a good sized shower. I was delighted to see that there was magnifying mirror installed, and the heated mirror was a great feature.
Breakfast was good and plentiful, but the evening meal was ok but nothing special.
Staff throughout were lovely.

Disliked · The only thing that would prevent me from staying again is the fact that the bed was very uncomfortable for me. Too hard and very creaky. It is shame really as everything else was perfect."
296,ronanbarton,2022-03-31,3.0,"Perfect if the price is right! I stayed at this property for a Friday afternoon/evening out in Bristol. 

This hotel was located a 7 mins walk from Temple Meads Train Station and about 7 mins from the City centre and 20 minutes from the Dockyard area. 

I had room 421, which was a 1 King Bed Standard room. The hotel is basic and perfectly formed with a great use of space. The decor was starting to show its age. The bathroom had an average pressure shower with the weirdest door I had seen.  

The bed was comfortable, although nothing to get to excited about. The Room could do with a slight modernisation with new carpets being laid. 

Summary - I would stay here again for the room rate I secured. Although would look to stay at another Hilton next time."
297,falkner2378,2022-02-28,5.0,"5 * service from Peter and Hilton 5* Hilton experience

Warm welcome at the front desk. Was my first time at this hilton and Peter took the time to Map out directions to the location of  my meeting.

The room was exceptionally clean and well maintained.    

I also had a gorgeous view of the park.

The icing on the cake was how well Peter at the front desk looked after me during my stay at checkin, during my stay and checkout.

I am a frequent traveller on business and will ensure this particular Hilton will be my hotel of choice when in Bristol. 

Already reserved for April."
298,JulieS408,2022-02-28,5.0,"Very Nearly Perfect I stay in many hotels for work purposes, this hotel was very nearly perfect.
Clean, quiet, modern and with aspects that you don’t realise are a blessing. Plug socket next to the bed head, comfortable pillows, one larger bedside table, great toiletries including sanitising wipes, no stray hairs from previous customers (this is my number 1 put off)
Each floor has a beautiful fragrance, which is immediately noticeable, fabulous dinner, very tasty (I had Salmon) and a good breakfast.
One tiny shortfall, lasting impressions etc, when I checked out the male receptionist asked for my room card and that was it, no ‘how was your stay’ not even a ‘goodbye’, so even though I had a fabulous experience at this hotel, I wasn’t going to tell him, as he couldn’t care less."
299,26lucyc,2022-02-28,5.0,"Great and comfortable stay I stayed here for 2 nights as a work visit. All of the staff at the hotel were fantastic. Great attitude. Helpful, and always available. One particular member of staff made me feel so welcome and everytime I walked past was always giving every customer 110% of their time and attention. The bed was super comfy and the fridge was especially helpful. I will always stay at this location when traveling to or through Bristol."
300,NikhilR548,2022-02-28,5.0,Weekend getaway to Bristol Me and my wife booked the Hilton Garden Inn during our recent visit to Bristol. The hotel is conveniently located close to the station and it ticked all the right boxes. We had booked a king room overlooking the park and a special mention Ms. Elena at the front desk who was very helpful to give us all the info about the city and things to do. She also helped with moving our rooms when the heating wasn't working properly and went above and beyond in offering personalized service and care. We also didn't miss an opportunity to grab drinks at the bar and Ms. Carla made us lovely drinks throughout our stay. I would also like to thank Peter who gave us local recommendations of restaurants and things to do and places to see in Bristol. On the whole it was a lovely trip and the team at Hilton truly made it a memorable stay. Looking forward to visit Bristol and stay at the Hilton next time.
301,Man1cmom,2022-02-28,3.0,"Disappointing stay Firstly, the hotel is quite difficult to find with lots of construction work going on. Then, despite getting there at 3, the time people check out, the car park was full. It’s very tight too. You can park on the car park opposite but then would have to move your car at 8am as there’s no return. So, we parked on the (expensive) NCP car park round the corner.

Check in - there were 2 ladies on the desk checking in 1 person whose reservation couldn’t be found. We were left waiting which shouldn’t have happened. However, once served they were polite and friendly.

Room - used a base only. Appearances were good and adequate for our needs. We were 2nd floor road facing and experienced no noise at all, very peaceful. Which is why it is a shame the bed was just so uncomfortable! It was 2 singles pushed together and they dipped in the middle. Not what we expected.

We wouldn’t stay again due to the car park issues and u comfy bed."
302,Go01341633536,2022-02-28,1.0,"Poor visit We arrived to our night away for it to be a complete disaster. We are given our room key, when we went to our room we found it already taken by other guests. Not only had you provided us with this, you’d exposed someone’s possessions by giving out more keys to their room! We went back down to reception to complain to be told ‘we’ve given you the wrong room’ there was no effort made by staff to try and turn our stay around into a good experience."
303,DarrenL225,2022-01-31,5.0,"Lovely place with very friendly staff I am a huge fan of Hilton Hotels, i always stay in them if they are available where I am travelling to.  There were 6 of us staying down in Bristol for a night and we all decided to stay here.  All of us thought it was a great hotel.  Nice location with a short walk to the station and to the old town.  The staff were friendly and helpful and, as always with a Hilton, the bed made for a great nights kip.  Breakfast was good, but I have had better at other Hiltons, with a very wide choice.  All in all a great place to stay."
304,JayandLuke2007,2021-11-30,4.0,"Good location and great breakfasts Nice location, very close to the main station once you know your way around and cut through the business area.  Some local facilities around, again more so where the offices are i.e. restaurants and pubs. 
Nice hotel, rooms are small and bed was ok, bit hard for my liking.  Fairly noisy and one criticism was the cleaning staff were very loud in the morning talking loudly at each other down the corridors so don't bet on a lay in. 
They had amazing breakfast selections however and excellent coffee."
305,jcoffey94,2021-12-31,5.0,Mr Excellent hotel great staff highly recommended food was lovely Highly recommended hotel clean would definitely stay here again with out doubt but boring for my age but it was a lovely hotel as I’m young
306,rachaelt684,2021-12-31,5.0,"Birthday weekend away for Hubby ! I booked a two night stay for my husbands birthday. 
Checking in was easy and parking in the hotel car park was an additional cost but worth it if you can get in. 
We had a room on the 4th floor and asked for one over looking the garden to the rear of the hotel. This would certainly have been quieter than overlooking the ring road. 
Rooms were very comfortable with fridge, safe, tea and coffee along with toiletries in the en-suite bathroom. 
We did have a few drinks in the bar which was very Covid safe and in these strange times we felt comfortable doing so. 
On our first evening we also ate in the hotel restaurant as we had an evening organised walk to attend. 
It’s proximity to the city centre, waters edge and many restaurants made this a great choice hotel."
307,GeorgiaWagstaff7,2021-12-31,5.0,Comfortable hotel in great location Hotel was in an ideal location walking distance from nearly everything.

Close to train station as well ! Just one thing we went by car and to get into car park you have to go through hotel Novotel car park in another road which we didn’t know ,so bit confusing, but overall good stay !"
309,misspoefary,2021-11-30,5.0,"Perfect location This hotel makes a comfortable and convenient base, especially if you travel by train, being situated between Temple Meads station and the interesting old part of the city. Everything we wanted to do could be reached on foot. 
The room was clean and quiet. The breakfast, served till 11 at weekends, provided an excellent selection of hot and cold food, which set us up for the day. There was a relaxed yet efficient atmosphere, with no queuing or overcrowding.
Luggage storage and a 12 o'clock checkout were a bonus. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful, and we hope to return to explore the city further."
310,Chixychax,2021-11-30,5.0,"Great hotel near Bristol Temple Meads Station We love this hotel.  It is near the train station and a 10 minute walk to the city centre.  The hotel is clean, comfortable and contemporary.  All the staff were friendly and polite.  They even served my favourite Spanish red wine (The Guv'nor) in the bar.  It is great value for money ......we will be back."
311,Theo_dagiadis,2021-11-30,4.0,"Great stay! 8/10 Breakfast the self-make Waffle was a nice thing.
8/10 Room Tv had only 7 channels out of 61 / AC was not properly working for heating.
Paulo was very helpfull and the hot water with lemon was something new for me and interesting.
Beth did an amazing Cocktail refreshing with passionfruit and always smiling.
Mario was there to attend to any of our requests.
Great stay and i would book again."
312,Keeplookingforplaces,2021-11-30,5.0,"Lovely weekend seeing Bristol & catching up with family. Love this hotel it’s the best in Bristol. Happy friendly staff, it’s clean & comfortable it’s also very busy which makes you realise just how hard the staff work but still maintain the standard. It’s a short walk from Bristol Temple Meads Train Station  into the reception & if you leave by opposite side then the walk into town is just a few minutes before you get to the centre of Bristol and the nightlife. Really can’t wait to go again."
313,imcwh,2021-11-30,5.0,"Great stay with Hilton standards. Stayed for two nights with room overlooking the street and never heard and traffic noise. Room was wonderful and spotless apart from damage obviously done by previous guests. Staff on reception were very friendly as we're those I the restaurant. They did a wonderful job clearing (and sanitising) the tables as well as topping up the buffet. The food was in such demand it couldn't possibly get cold. Nice enough location. Five minutes from train station. Bars and Tesco five minutes the other direction.
Won't be going back to Bristol but would recommend this hotel to others."
314,karenrW8407CJ,2021-11-30,4.0,"Nice stay We stayed for two nights, check in was very easy. We used JustPark so didn't experience the hotel carpark. 
Room was ok, overlooking the derelict building at the rear. 
Fridge was a bonus as we could have proper milk rather than the provided uht cartons.
Missed breakfast fist morning, but made it on the second morning. It was a little cold and hash browns the were in an enclosed serving dish so not crispy! 
The manager was rather rude to a member of staff because the coffee machine was broken-it wasn't her fault but his attitude was not professional, also he was wearing jeans and trainers and an open topped shirt, no tie....not what i would expect from a Hilton manager. 
Would stay again but probably skip the expense of breakfast."
315,Cromwell32,2021-11-30,4.0,"Very good apart from the breakfast Stayed here for one night. Staff were very friendly and helpful despite the hotel being very busy. They even gave us a room away from the large groups that were staying there. Room was a good size and comfortable. Would recommend a garden view over the park behind the hotel. Hotel is easy to get to by car and train. It's away from the noise of the city centre but only a 10-12 minute walk in to reach the the old port, shops and bars. Has its own parking although spaces are quite limited. Good price of £120 including breakfast- although that was the one disappointment. The bacon was barely cooked and my wife said her mushrooms were tasteless and the baked beans were cold. The fruit salad was basically apple, so good if you like apple. My hash brown was also cold. It was not the worst we've had but far from the best. Despite this I would still recommend this hotel for a friendly, pleasant stay with easy access to a day in Bristol at a decent price."
316,ACP66,2021-11-30,5.0,"Will stay again Extremely friendly reception team, and resolved the parking issue to our relief (Hilton car park was full. Directed to directly adjacent pay & display which was free from 6:00pm - 8:00am for Hilton Guests  - then Ringo App to simply book from 8:00am)
Lovely room...not the biggest we have been in for this sort of hotel, but very well proportioned. Very happy with the shower / bathroom / bed / facilities...and extremely clean ! 
Found breakfast to be way ahead of similar hotels. Again staff so friendly. Eggs were being cooked to order, food replenished all the time, and the ambience of the restaurant was so relaxing and pleasant.
Close to shopping areas and directly by the train station. Can't think of anywhere better to stay in a mid-budget hotel if you are after a night or two in Bristol. Will definitely stay here again.
Had a 5th floor park view room. Will ask for this again.
Thanks to all the staff...and especially Zoe on reception who gave us an unsuspected surprise when we booked in (thought she knew our son...but say no more !!) You were all so friendly and helpful."
317,AndrewL729,2021-11-30,2.0,"Hilton money, just not Hilton standards Check in was great, but downhill from then. Room was very tired and basic, seats stained and mould on the shower sealant. Bed was like sleeping on a sheet plywood. Went down for breakfast, eggs overcooked and no ketchup. I was also surprised that one of the managers was putting the eggs on, not a chef or someone appropriately dressed."
318,PMack19991968,2021-11-30,5.0,"Exceptional customer service. Elena was on hand to ensure the smoothest possible check in for our entire tour party and all the staff helped us out with our Tour Coach parking. Again, very high standards of customer service. Thank you!"
319,K8495MZamandac,2021-11-30,5.0,"Mini break. Driving to this hotel was not a problem. Very easy as was access back towards the m4. Was able to park on site which was great though the £16 for 24 hours is a bit steep though. 
Reception area clean and welcoming as was the staff. We arrived ahead of Check in. They happily stored out luggage and gave us a map of the local area which was very helpful as everything was in walking distance.
We walked 10minutes to Cabot Circus which had a lovely array of top end and budget friendly shops.
The room was the cleanest we have stayed in, in a long time. It also smelt clean. Spacious with a good view on the 5th floor. 
Fabulous shower.
We had a meal booked in the evening at San Carlo which I 100 per cent recommend but be warned its not cheap.  Reception called us a taxi with no fuss.
As always ypu never get the same nights sleep in a different bed to your own and this was the case with the bed here. It wasn't uncomfortable and did sleep without discomfort. Very soft bed with two very soft pillows. Comfortable temperature in the room also.
Breakfast was included in our stay and WOW!!!!!!! 
There is something there for everyone. 
Cereals, fresh fruit, Buffet full English, continental, make ypur own waffles, tea and coffee aswell as fresh juices. 
I had a waffle with bacon and scrambled egg, and the hubby had a full English.
Wonderful.
Will definitely be booking here again aswell as recommended to others.
Thank You Hilton."

Clean and tidy throughout the hotel. Friendly help staff. As per other reviews there isn’t much around the hotel. Cabot’s shopping however is about 7 minute walk. There is a Starbucks about 5 min walk just by the station. Generally good value for money all in all. Would stay here again."
322,stujay2,2021-10-31,5.0,"Happy Hilton Hotel Fabulous two night stay!
A welcoming clean and friendly Hotel and in an excellent location.
Check in was very quick and easy.
Very knowledgeable reception staff, especially Peter, who can advise on almost everything in the local area, buses etc..
The room was very clean and the bathroom offered a fabulous shower. 
Facilities in the room were plentiful to allow a very pleasant stay.
We only stayed bed and breakfast but I have to say it was  just perfect with a vast array of food options and they accommodate well for the GLUTEN FREE diner. 
The dining area is very well kept, clean and a calm atmosphere and luckily with very helpful cheerful staff.
Will happily stay again and definitely recommend.
Thank you to all involved in making our stay memorable for all the right reasons."
323,stewartc191,2021-10-31,5.0,"Fantastic stay - excellent location This hotel exceeded my expectations. Checked in on a Friday night for 3 nights on a trip from Aberdeen with friends. Cherry is an absolute super star. She should be a poster girl for Hilton. Her service and attention to guests was absolutely second to none. Nothing was too much of a problem for her and when she saw us in the bar during the weekend she would come and chat to us all. Really nice room but hotels need to stop with the COVID excuse now and do housekeeping every day, not on request. Carla in the bar was another excellent member of staff. Friendly and professional. The hotel is a stone’s throw from Temple Meads so in a great location. I would highly recommend this hotel and will be booking it next time I’m in Bristol."

The hotel was very clean (still following covid cleaning with high standards), the beds comfy and the staff were amazing.

I found the room to be rather small and poorly laid out, with the armchair a nuisance since there was not enough space for it. Comfortable bed and nice shower. Very nice welcome when I arrived. Good breakfast and adequate internet. Well located near to Temple Meads and the city center. I'd stay again if needed."

Got there and hilton parking is full + cars waiting in the car park. Parked across the road but had to leave by 12pm as its short term parking, which ruined the trip. 

They must be well aware as thry had pre printed instructions on how to pay at the other parking area (max 4 hours). You need to pay at 8am to ensure you are not fined/towed. This parking was also full by 10pm.

Wish they would have been honest as when we spoke to the receptionist on arrival she said parking is full after 6pm and on weekends. 

Very disappointed"
330,Stevie390,2021-09-30,4.0,"Comfortable city centre hotel The Hilton Garden Inn is in a convenient location a few minutes’ walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station. It’s well located for the commercial district, but about 10-15 minutes’ walk from the main tourist and shopping areas of central Bristol and so feels a little detached from most eating and entertainment places. A bus goes directly from outside the building towards Clifton village and Bristol Zoo. The hotel seems to have plenty of car parking.

The room was a decent size and had ample storage space, desk, fridge, safe, coffee/tea and comfortable bed. The wifi was good and sufficient for video streaming. My room had a pleasant view over the Temple Gardens to the rear of the building and the city skyline beyond. I’d recommend rooms with that rear view, as the road to the front is quite busy.

The hotel offered a full self-service buffet of pre-Covid standards – full English hot and cold food, cereals, pastries, juices, etc. The staff were helpful and friendly in the restaurant, which also served evening meals. There’s also a small marketplace selling drinks and snacks.

Overall, this hotel won’t dazzle and isn’t in the heart of the action, but it is comfortable and offers a pleasant stay. It’s a good base for a weekend break in this interesting and attractive city. I was happy with it."

Therefore a very lo g wait with others to check in. Went to eat in the evening and an hour to get food (apparently under staffed kitche) and when it arrived it was under cooked chicken. They did the right thing, as I said the staff were great but I then had to find somewhere else to eat at 21:00 (rather than wait a further hour for food) when all I wanted to do was go to my room.

I was practically forced to pay for the amount over my company meal allowance  each night, I refused & said it'll be paid in full when I check out.. they then kept calling my room, been a night worker not a good move.. the front glass windows were filthy.. if this hotel is the standard for all Hiltons then I would be ashamed."
337,asb2003,2021-08-31,4.0,"Not quite 5 stars, but a pleasant and comfortable stay Staff were very helpful when we had a problem with strong smell in the room. Peter and Jamie were especially approachable and professional in dealing with the matter.

Breakfast was very good, with usual selection + a waffle machine, continental, pastries, various seeds and dried fruits etc.

Bar service was substandard, and were twice told that ingredients for our drinks had run out. The hot chocolate made from hot water and instant powder, and served spilt without a tissue, not drinkable. All 4 drinks served separately with long wait times. No complaint due to the fact that we were using complimentary drinks vouchers, but as paying customers would've been rightfully annoyed.

Location was superb, just a short walk from Old City and City Centre, and the reception area was pleasant, with the fruity water provided throughout the day being a nice touch. Rooms and bathrooms were small and lacked some amenities for Hilton standard, and the housekeeping staff seemed unwilling to return a smile, but generally rooms were clean and sufficient and A/C was fantastic."

343,mfranks911,2021-07-31,5.0,"Comfortable Stay, clean and bright rooms and friendly staff A typical non-descript modern building from the outside the Hilton Garden Inn is very convenient for Temple Meads station (just a five minute stroll) and a little further from the harbour's lively facilities and the Town Centre, all in all around fifteen minutes walk from Central Boulelvard.

Once inside the modern theme continued and we had a very friendly greeting on checking in and our room was ready although we were a little early.

Our room (510) on the top floor was overlooking Temple Gardens and was quiet (probably much more so than rooms on the main road side), bright and modern with all the amenities expected for a City break. It looked as if it had been refurbished quite recently and everything was neat and tidy and the bathroom had an excellent shower. With a fridge, safe and tea and coffee making facilities  facilities it had all you might really need.

The bed was extremely comfortable although the room was not that large but ideal as a base.

The lifts were efficient and breakfast was taken on the ground floor restaurant and with lovely weather it was possible to eat on the outside terrace. It was so nice to be able to go back to having a breakfast buffet and people were being sensible all round. We did not eat in the hotel at lunch or dinner as there are so many excellent restaurants in this charming City.

The Hilton Garden Inn is an ideal place for a short stay break in Bristol and we would not hesitate in staying again if we are in town again."
344,Peachey68,2021-07-31,5.0,Relaxing stay We only stayed for 2 nights but will definitely be back. Hotel was bright and well decorated. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient. Our fridge wasn't working on our first day but reception stored our bits in their downstairs fridge and brought up to our room in the morning. Fridge was fixed the next day. Some restaurant menus in the room would be a good idea as we didn't realise until too late that you did afternoon tea 😧  All in all though 10/10.

Breakfast was great, virtually the same choice as before and we we very impressed especially as we had a very poor breakfast offering at another well known hotel chain a couple of weeks earlier. There was an issue with the key card not working on at least 3 occasions and it was lucky we were on the first floor as it could have been a lot more inconvenient than it was if we were on a higher floor. The staff were friendly and helpful and we would definitely stay again if we go back to Bristol."
346,ThisIsJules75,2021-07-31,5.0,"Clean, comfortable, quiet with great staff No complaints about the room.  Just what you expect from a Hilton hotel in this price range.  The room was bright and spacious, clean, comfortable and we got a good nights sleep.  The location of the hotel was ideal as well.  Only a few mins from the train station and short walk from the middle of town.

All the staff were super friendly and helpful.  Extra thanks to the gentleman at reception who helped direct my wife to a shop to find a hairbrush, and the lady serving breakfast who was a breath of fresh air and positivity.  Excellent service by all the hotel staff.  Would stay again."

He is a credit to the hotel. We received a free room upgrade and complimentary drinks. The cleanliness and service is first class. The rooms are spotlessly clean. Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in a central location."
348,Roving618267,2021-07-31,3.0,"Not bad, but not what I expected from a Hilton This hotel is fine, but nothing special. I’ve come to expect a slightly luxurious standard from Hilton Hotels, but this one is a little cramped and tired. The room felt very small, and the furnishings were basic. Some signs of wear and tear. 
The staff were all very polite and helpful, and the breakfast was good and fresh. 
Nothing awful here, but for the price you can find much more comfortable accommodation in Bristol."
349,1152man,2021-06-30,5.0,"Bristol the best From the moment we checked in for our overnight stay, things could not have been better. Lovely room with I have to say the best shower I've ever had. I didn't want to get out. We were on a coach trip so evening meal was provided. Again this was a  first class three course meal.

A very pleasant bar area and I liked the fact a local beer brew was available on draft.

Breakfast the following morning was again excellent with so much on offer.

Well done to everyone."
350,Chariotchoogle,2021-06-30,5.0,"Great Weekend Break This was our third visit to the Hilton, the first since easement of lockdown restrictions, have to say its better than ever.  Rooms are still super comfortable, staff  continue to be super friendly, courteous and professional. Two things that have changed since my last visit is that its nice to see life again, people of all ages having fun whilst recognizing covid regulations.  Breakfast is a real treat, almost back to normality, everything you need, gone are the Croissants in a bag, and it proved that customers' can take and be in charge of themselves to be covid respectful, well done Hilton for making that work.  If I had to call out a particular member of staff it would be the ""hello my lovely"" breakfast chef, she surely brightened most peoples days up.  Also the poor barman on the Saturday night, even though he was so over worked with preparing non stop cocktails for several parties he remained cheerful, but this is where I think the on duty managers' should have got involved, in the words of Alex Polizzi role your sleeves up and poor some ******* drinks.
All n all, another great weekend in Bristol, comfortable room, great breakfast, lovely staff and a sign of life getting back to normal.  Thank you Hilton for a lovely weekend."

354,GrantGLondon,2021-06-30,4.0,"Tiny room but very good hotel We stayed here for 5 nights, and it was everything it claimed to be. The room itself was ridiculously small, and as a result I left a couple of things behind. It was only possible for one person at a time to move around the room, so I never checked the window side when we left. Because of that, I left two items behind but the hotel sent them to me very quickly and efficiently, so full marks for that. They also went to some lengths to try and get us an air-conditioned room. We arrived on the first warm day of the year and the room was sweltering. In the end they got the air-conditioning going and we had no further problem. The rooms have fridges for the use of the people staying in them, which is very rare in the UK, where refrigeration is regarded with suspicion. For me, that automatically makes this the best hotel in Bristol. The breakfast was very good. The restaurant was adequate, if somewhat chaotic. The shower was good. The wifi was excellent after a few teething problems. I'd definitely recommend this hotel, and would be happy to stay there again."

356,O1742YJlindseyr,2021-06-30,4.0,"Great bar and restaurant We stayed here for a night on our way home from Wales. We booked a 'great escape' deal with dinner and breakfast and a variety of extras like a cocktail, antipasta and wine and a really late check out of 4pm.
The hotel is spotlessly clean. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The room was small, nothing fancy but comfortable. Tea and coffee and toiletries in the room.
We had a problem with the noise of the air conditioning, it was like an aeroplane taking off when on full. It was needed on full as it was pushing 30 degrees. I asked for it to be checked and it was immediately, no messing about. The staff also checked if we could move rooms and while they did this they gave us a complimentary drink so we could wait in comfort. This was a lovely touch.
The bar is a nice environment. We sat outside to have our meal which was very tasty. Bradley served us and right from the start he made us feel at home. He made us lovely drinks and was so cheery we felt very happy. I think he deserves a special thank you for making our evening more enjoyable! Breakfast was good quality and lots of choice, nice to see fresh pastries which other hotels have stopped since covid, little things like that were nice to see. Check out was easy, nothing too much trouble for the staff here."

We were welcome by a really nice receptionist (Eleanor, I think!) She was really helpful and informative.

The room has everything you need, nice views facing the Temple garden plus it was spotless.

We had dinner in the restaurant on Monday and the manager on duty was very attentive and chatty. Food was also very good, however we were quite full but we were offered a box to take the rest with us without even asking for it - Nice gesture! 

Breakfast was really good, plenty of choices and the staff again, was really helpful and friendly ( especially, Louisa and the girl from Almería - Apologise, I don’t remember her name). 

Good hotel and amazing staff! Thank you!"

I can honestly say the staff in the hotel are fantastic, every one of them, credit to you Hilton. Special mention to Brad and Paulo. Breakfast was excellent and everything was COVID safe in all areas. We particularly enjoyed the sun terrace with such cool relaxing music. We spent a day in Bath and the hotel is just across the road from the strain station and the journey is around 10 minutes and just one stop. Well worth a visit.
All in all, we loved the hotel and Bristol, and will be returning very soon."

I was waiting at the lift and suddenly the roller goes down and the fireplace goes off. Bear in mind the door was closed. Finally after a few minutes it opens...the receptionist saw me and no one even tells me why the alarm went off. I HAD TO GO up to them and they said it was a ""test"".

Was invited a few times after booking to upgrade to a high floor (for £5). I declined.  At online check in I selected a top floor room.  A few hours later I got a call to say that the top floors are closed, and that I'd been moved to the same room on the 2nd floor.  Then on arrival I got assigned a different room.

My initial welcome was excellent despite myself being tired and made to being felt very welcome.

Upon checking in my room I noticed the air conditioning was not working but quickly moved to a new room. 

I had evening food which was ok, just feels awkward walking to your room and then you lose the freshness but in general a good effort considering the epidemic we are going through.

As with breakfast was slightly annoyed as I requested a change of time the evening prior on my second day but this was obviously missed out so had to very quickly get Ready. All in all the breakfast was absolutely delicious, I do look forward to eating in the restaurant moving forwards.

The beds are very comfy with a large tv and good working space on the large desk.

All the staff at the hotel are a great credit with their smiles and their politeness. Thank you and look forward to seeing you soon."

The hotel is clean and decent but cannot give it more than 2 stars as no connection to internet, colleagues had same issue. Modern hotels should not have these issues.
Disappointing to have score so low, grub was ok in restaurant decent but not special I would say.

Sort out your connection!"
374,Kkwally,2020-10-31,3.0,"Not bad but probs wouldn’t come back Arrived in Bristol with my partner for the weekend. We were checked in quickly by a very friendly man and went to our room, it was very clean but smaller than a premier inn room that we had stayed ina few days before. 

We went out for a few drinks in Bristol then came back for a couple in the hotel bar, the bar manager and staff were really accommodating and friendly and really made us feel welcome. On the first night we realised the bed wasn’t particularly comfy and pillows are feather (I believe) which means they deflate into nothing when you lay on them which led to a bad nights sleep. 

On the second night I got some more pillows in the hope it would be comfort but alas they were still hopeless and after a night of tossing and turning I called reception in the middle of the night to get an extra pillow. Now I’m not sure what the receptionist thought I was doing with these extra pillows but he was very cagey and a little rude about giving me another one. 

Overall the service was generally very good but room was not comfortable which let it down"

Was not value for money. 

3 sandwiches - ham salad, cheese and pickle and egg.... very cheap fillings .... where’s the salmon and beef?!  tasted like they had been made in the morning and left as edges were crusty

Small slice of fruitcake, cherry Bakewell and a defrosted Elaine. 

2 scones with Jam an cream .... we used all the cream on 2 of scones and asked the waitress for more cream - she went in kitchen and came back saying no more cream as the chef has left for the day .... I didn’t realise you had to be a professional chef to put cream in a container 😱.... 

We have had lots of afternoons teas and this was by far the worst one we have had for the money we paid. We won’t be returning and would advise you to book somewhere else."
377,AlanKLeeds,2020-09-30,2.0,"Poor - will not stay again I don't like to post a poor review. Any hotel can have one problem, but there were too many at this hotel.

We've stayed here a number of times over the years, and I this will be the last. 

The rooms haven't changed much - a bit on the small side but reasonably well equipped. 

It's the approach to Covid-19 that lets it down. We booked in for 3 nights, only to find that there would be no room service. This would be OK, but toiletries, coffee, cups, etc were only provided for a one night stay, meaning we had to call (or visit due to no reply) reception for more.  Not good.

Things got worse for the evening meal. A poorly photocopied menu offering burgers and pizzas should have set alarm bells ringing. As should an empty restaurant at 7:00pm. The pizza was mediocre - dry chicken, dry sauce and too much chilli on a doughy base. Other hotels seem to be able to maintain standards, so why not Hilton? The server also wore a face mask that didn't cover his nose. Not good.

Overall, the hotel seemed short staffed and doing the minimum to get by. Back when this was a Mint hotel, and then a City Inn, you were guaranteed quality food (and an iMac in the room). I appreciate there are Covid-19 guidelines, but this is no excuse for such a fall in standards. Not something one expects from any of the Hilton chain. We stayed in two other hotels during September; they managed to deliver great service and food, including room service, whilst maintaining good Covid-19 procedures.

Finally, checking out was probably the worst I've had. First we had a breakfast charged to the room, which we didn't have. The gent at check-out corrected it. But when I looked at the bill, a £5.55 had appeared. I went back and the gent explained (almost condescendingly) that the removal of the breakfast charge resulted in the balance being less than the guarantee amount that the hotel charged to the card on checking in, resulting in a £5.55 credit being added back. Fine, but all entries were shown as debits and all were coded with no clue as to what the codes were. Sorry, but I expect a bill or invoice to be clear and understandable. Not good, Hilton."
378,Stenvoid,2020-09-30,3.0,"Clean and efficient - very difficult to find by car This is a centrally located hotel, it's good on check-in, with clean rooms, efficient staff, covid-friendly throughout and an excellent breakfast offering (so efficient in fact they cleared my coffee away before I'd even taken a sip!).

However, what - for me - let the place down, was trying to find it. Not necessarily the hotel's fault but details on the website were scant and the combination of recent road-layout changes, closed off roads, roadworks and traffic volume in Bristol meant it took me more than 45 minutes to find it, driving round in circles."

Reception explained that they were limiting the stuff they put out as it has to be removed after each guest stay. So no mini bar or excessive toiletries. This was fine as we bring our own and reception just said ask if you need it.
Time slot needs to be booked for breakfast to enable corona spacing. Good choice of breakfast, cooked items served to you by staff. All straight forward.
Good shower, I found the bed a little too firm but each to their own. Air con good but a little noisy.
Quick 10 min walk to old city and attractions and not far from Temple Meads Station. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Would recommend it"
381,Cardiardaith,2020-08-31,3.0,"Handy for train station but no left luggage facility Few mins walk from Temple Meads station along a new path through new business district which is pedestrianised. (Go straight ahead after the ticket barriers and don't exit into station drop off area).  Very modern and clean decor to the hotel but nothing memorable.  Breakfast served in their restaurant which is a plus.  Nice walk through old churchyard opposite will get you to convenience stores, couple of nice pubs and a family Italian restaurant (currently closed).  Five minutes further and you are in the old heart of Bristol-Corn Street, atmospheric Market, Quay restaurants and bars etc.  Good soundproofing in room and aircon means it won't get too hot as windows don;t open very far.  Shower only, no bath.  
Main gripe is that there is no left luggage at the moment due to Covid restrictions....Having arrived by train at 9am I was faced with wheeling my case around Bristol until 3pm check-in!! I would have gone home but fortunately, the duty manager yielded and let me leave my case in an empty office.  Lacking an area to leave luggage is a real nuisance for people using public transport and needs to be addressed by Hilton if they want to welcome tourists back and have properties near train stations where a number of people won't have a car or have no access to left luggage facilities (none at station)."

Air con is old fashioned so would be a nice wait before your room cooled down . Not helped by the fact the window has a tiny little bit you can open that hardly let's any breeze in . The bed was solid , was looking forward to a relaxing bath but that was scuppered when I went to my room to discover there is no bathtub. The fridge was not working had a bottle of water in it for 2 days and I don't even think it dropped a degree . Also the car park is tiny and I think the charge for the parking is a tad astronomical considering the price your charging for a sub standard 4 star Hotel room .
For a 4 star Hotel and the price you pay you would expect a bit more . 
However the staff and service I recieved was good so kudos to them . Probably wouldn't stay here again to be honest , which is sad really ."

The hotel location and amenities are acceptable for the price. 

However I experienced a problem with a colleague coming to my room in the late evening. 

This was aggressively handled (initially), and the policy of the hotel not clear on the issue. 

My colleague was told in no uncertain terms he was a risk of Covid19. Which is odd since I had no health screening on check in . 

DO NOTuse this hotel if you plan late work  meetings or if a colleague needs to collect an item.  

I felt that I was judged by the staff member in question. We resolved this, although the policy still not clear.

Breakfast paid on booking in advance £9.95 (£12.95 otherwise) again ok though plentiful was not too cheap, very ordinary sort of breakfast, nothing particularly tasty. Drinks very expensive e.g small bottle of beer £5.20, large glass of wince £7.50. Overall warm, comfortable & clean with really pleasant staff. Around £50 per night to stay, close to local pubs etc & railway station. Pay for parking @ £16 per night right outside."
396,paullV9381VX,2020-03-31,2.0,A hotel that never delivers! If you like uncooked omelette for breakfast then this is the hotel for you! The hotel is apparently attractive but the experience is quite different. There is no interest in a good experience from staff and no attempt to rectify poor service
397,Knmarsh,2020-01-31,5.0,"Great locatuon I stayed here for a week while on business.  It’s a convenient walk from the train station and numerous restaurants.  The staff was always very helpful.  We arrived from the States early, hours before check in time.  I was able to check in early to get some rest and they expedited the cleaning of a room for my coworker while also offering him a meal in the on site restaurant while he waited.  I’m returning to Bristol for work this summer and will definitely stay here again."

Rooms are on the small side but have everything you need, comfy bed and very clean. Breakfast is good, just wish there were a couple more veggie options. Staff very friendly and courteous. Perfect for a long weekend will certainly come back."

Easy to find from Cardiff.
£16 overnight for car park... spaces limited.
Rooms are clean, spacious. Iron in room. Tea & coffee facilities (no biscuits🤪). Complimentary soaps. 
Comfy bed, rooms are quiet.
Staff very nice and helpful!
Lots of shops/restaurants/bars nearby, walking distance. (Ladies in heels may want to taxi) 

Will most definitely go back!"
400,LondonNifty,2020-02-29,3.0,"Mixed bag I’m a big fan of the Hilton brand. However, this was one stay where I was slightly disappointed. Service as usual was faultless, quiet room on the fourth floor smallish with the king sized bed but perfectly adequate. Nonetheless, the Scotch egg ordered from room service was partly raw and £5.00 extra to deliver it to the room when getting downstairs was complicated let the overall stay down."
401,kulwinderr2015,2020-02-29,2.0,"Doesn’t uphold Hilton standards... I have been a regular visitor to this particular hotel for many years, well before Hilton took it over, back when it was known as the Mint Hotel. 

At that time it struck me as a fantastic example of an independent smart, contemporary hotel with exemplary standards of service. When Hilton took it over several years ago, I feared the worst. With, it transpires, justification.

Standards at this hotel have since gradually slipped to the point where I am now considering whether to ever visit it again (and I am a Hilton Honors member!).

Parking is now chargeable, at £16 a day. It used to be free for guests when this was the Mint. But there’s worse, much worse. 

I stayed in room 506 and, having returned to the room after dinner out in Bristol, I discovered that the air con/heating system in the room was completely kaput. 

To his credit, one of the staff - David - was quick to attend when I reported it at the front desk. But his solution was not to offer a change of room but to simply wheel a battered small oil radiator into the room. That really isn’t what I was expecting.

In any case, the heater was incapable of heating the room - it was way too small - so I spent a very long night in a very cold room, not at all my idea of a pleasant hotel stay. I’m just pleased that I hadn’t brought my wife on this trip, she would never have let me hear the end of it!

The speed with which the heater was wheeled in to the room suggests this was a very well known issue… why is the room being let out to guests while the heating system is known to be faulty?

Breakfasts here, too, are now an unmitigated disaster. It’s not the fault of the staff, they try their hardest. It’s just that there simply aren’t enough of them to adequately service the number of guests in the hotel. 

Foodstuffs took an absolute age to replenish - after 10 minutes I gave up waiting for the beans container to be refilled and had my full English (utterly bland, bacon as tough as well worn leather) without them. 

The pastry trays, too, were empty when I arrived - and stayed empty until I was about to leave, about 45 minutes later. Staff were often nowhere to be seen at the counter: guests took to reaching over flipping eggs that staff had started cooking!

People were hovering around the food trays for absolutely eons, hoping against hope that trays would be refilled: they waited in vain. The couple next to me had asked for waffles but gave up after 20 minutes. 

Then the two coffee machines gave up - there’s only self-service here now (when it was the Mint there was waiter service). I had to resort to asking the bar staff to get me one. However, I was third in line and by the time I got one and returned to my table the waitress had assumed I had left the restaurant and had cleared my table!

When checking out I was asked if I had enjoyed my stay. The receptionist seemed baffled when I said I had not, down mainly to the lack of heating. “But you got an oil heater, right?”, she queried. “Yes, but it was completely useless, I still froze,” I pointed out. “Oh well, I’m sorry about that,” she said before jovially printing out the bill. And that was that. 

The sad truth is that Hilton has failed to maintain the standards of the previous management at this hotel. Yes, it’s clean and the beds are comfy but there are other basics that guests need to be able to rely on. 

Like effective heating on a cold February night. Like a restaurant with enough staff in it. So I think that this, sadly, is the last year that I’ll be giving the Hilton Garden Inn Bristol my patronage. The Hilton group need to MUCH better than this…"
402,laurensh223,2020-02-29,5.0,"Friendly Staff and Lovely Bed! The moment I got to the reception area I knew this was a good hotel. The staff were welcoming and efficient, telling me places to check out whilst I was staying. You can even help yourself to a nibble, like a flapjack!

The quality of the room was super, it was spacious and the bed was dreamy. It was very clean overall. Bathroom seemed a tad small, but it'll do for one person at a time. The shower was a perfect size and easy to get into.

Breakfast was delicious, a classy buffet style and the staff were friendly and helpful throughout. I really enjoyed speaking to the staff, especially the bar staff who recognised my tired yawn and made me laugh.

Next time I come to Bristol I'll return here, especially for the location and bus links!"
403,ellicesophia,2020-02-29,5.0,"My favourite hotel in Bristol! I stay in Bristol frequently with work and have tried a number of hotels however The Garden Inn is by far my favourite. The rooms are clean and spacious with a nice view if you are on the park-facing side. 

Breakfast is of a great quality and the location is central enough to be within walking distance to temple meads and the city centre. 

However, the thing that distinguishes this hotel from the others is the customer service. The staff on reception, the restaurant staff and the cleaners are all so welcoming and can’t do enough for you. The customer service I’ve had while staying here every week for the past few weeks has been the best customer service I have ever received. The staff at breakfast even remember my daily breakfast order and bring it without me asking! Amazing customer service and so I will continue to choose the Garden Inn over other hotels in Bristol."

We stayed for new years eve as a large group of girls.
Everyone was lovely the staff very friendly allthoguh so much so that they gave my friend a key to my room when she arrived hours after me and had already given me her key to the room as the booking was in my name. She said no confirmation was needed just that she knew what room number i was in.
There were also trays of dirty plates stacked by the lifts from when we arrived until when we left but the room itself was clean and tidy and super comfortable"

408,LJR19951711,2020-02-29,2.0,"Didn’t want to sleep anyway Hotel was perfectly pleasant however the room was unbelievably noisy. Being woken up at 6am by what I am assuming is domestic staff in the cupboard next to our room making stupid amounts of noise, to the noise of people on the stairs present constantly. The room was clean, however it was odd that there was no big light, just bedside table lights. The shower was good temperature just very low pressure, it was more like being outside on a windy but drizzly day, water lightly touching you. The bed was also noisy as anything, the slightest of movements being met with the most noise imaginable."
409,ErinTravel3,2020-01-31,2.0,"Broken heating; old rooms; stains on walls The hotel itself was freezing upon entering (my stay was in January). I was given a room that had cold air blowing from the vents. The hotel's heating engineer tried to fix it, which didn't work. I was moved to another room with heating that kept switching off and would not turn back on without manually pressing the button - not really possible at night. I asked for a space heater, but they were all loaned out to other guests. It's particularly annoying because I had just arrived from a 3-hour train delay and had an important interview the next morning. All I needed was time to prepare and a good night's sleep, but instead I had to spend time sorting a heating engineer for Room #1 then moving to Room #2 then freezing all night - I had to wear my winter coat and it was still freezing. Additionally, the rooms are old and there were large stains on the walls. I've had far better stays at budget hotels and would expect more from a city centre Hilton brand - I paid £120 ($160) for one night. The staff are nice and the reception and engineer tried to fix the problem; unfortunately, it didn't work, and this will be my first and last stay. Heating should be guaranteed for England in January!"
410,HBM_26,2020-01-31,5.0,"Good business hotel  I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The rooms are comfortable with good beds and plenty of towels. The breakfast was well stocked, good fruit salad and they make a nice omelette. Would stay here again when next in Bristol."

413,Jannerbloke,2020-01-31,4.0,"Any port in a storm. Here for one night for work. Coincided with January storm Brendan. Room up to usual standard and booking in and out efficient but, probably because of the lashing rain and powerful winds, both the dining room and bar were packed, presumably because almost everybody couldn’t face going outside into the tempest. No gripes except getting home the following evening to find that I had been belatedly sent an email doubling as a by now obsolete half price voucher for the meal I had eaten at the hotel on the evening of my stay."

416,F6429EBpaulr,2019-12-31,3.0,"Clean and functional but no heart This is a mediocre hotel in an edge of inner-city location. It is functional and clean. You can get to the city centre on foot in 10-15 minutes and I believe the train station is even closer.

The restaurant is ok but the food was luke-warm and uninteresting. It's worth getting there early to avoid the crush.

We were a fairly large family group and the bar lounge was simply not big / and comfortable enough to properly relax together.

The hotel"
417,Butsy19,2020-01-31,4.0,"Great Stay Chose this hotel due to its location, 5 minutes from train station, in one direction and 10 mins in other direction to shopping areas, bars and restaurants. 
Checked in on-line, and reserved a room of my choice, which made the actual check-in quick, easy and faultless. 
Acknowledged as a HH Gold Member and offer my benefits, either bonus points or free breakfast, we opted for breakfast. 
Room wasn't as big as other Hilton's we have stayed in, however for a short 3 night stay, it was fine, it had all the amenities you expect from Hilton, fridge, safe, tea/coffee, iron etc. 
Bathroom was quite compact, however again everything you needed. 
Breakfast is a buffet style, and it was superb, you are shown to a table and after that you just help yourself to anything/everything you want. 
Fried and Poached Eggs cooked fresh for you, and there is even the option for an omelette, along with all the usual, fruit juice, water, fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereal, ham, cheese, mackerel, and of course everything you need for a full English. 
Lovely little bar too for a drink after a long day's walk/shopping/sightseeing. 
The best thing about this hotel are the staff, they are all very friendly, and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. 
All in all we had a wonderful stay, and thanks again to all the staff, whether reception, duty managers, restaurant, bar and not to mention the people who looked after our rooms as everything was immaculate and clean. 
Would definitely stay here again."
418,katevale46,2019-12-31,4.0,"Great location for  Temple Meads  Less than 5 minutes walk from Temple Meads, leave the station through the exit opposite the platforms rather than the main exit. Passed the few shops and turn left at Wetherspoons and you can see the sign for the hotel. Comfortable rooms, ours was lovely and quiet and could see the small park at the rear. Exceptional service on checking in, and held our bags when we checked out so we could walk to the City Centre and back as had a teatime flight. Breakfast was superb but the scrambled eggs looked a bit undercooked for my liking so I opted for a poached egg which was freshly cooked by the egg man.  Never had a bad stay here and will happily return, got a real bargain price this time so very happy."
419,johnbydefault,2019-12-31,5.0,"Great Hotel in a Superb Location I stayed here from the 22nd to the 28th of December so I could spend Christmas with my Sister and Brother In Law who live near to Bristol.
Back in February, I was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma which is, unfortunately, a Terminal Cancer and I do not know just how many more Christmases I will be around for so it was really important to me to make this one special and spend it with my loved ones. Before I continue with the review I just want to make it clear that the hotel and hotel staff had no knowledge of my condition other than that I requested a room near the lifts due to mobility issues on my booking.
On arrival, the lady at reception pointed out that she had seen my notes regarding mobility and that the room I had myself chosen on the Hilton Honors Online Check-In service was actually furthest away from the lift and would I like her to see if a room was available that would be closer for me. When I said yes she then found me a room that was one of the very closest to the lifts and gave me a free upgrade to it as it was a Park View room that normally cost extra per night. This was very much appreciated and I am very grateful for this service. The room itself was lovely. Decent size and facilities were all very good. With staying almost a week having a mini-fridge in the room was a big plus point. The 42"" Flat Screen TV was a great feature too although with a limited Freeview selection of channels other than Sky Sports. But still a welcome feature. It would be nice if you could cast your own services to it such as Netflix or Now TV but this isn't something that many hotels currently offer so not something the Hilton, in particular, is failing at.
The Queen size bed was firm and comfy. The air conditioning was very good changing quickly between cooler and hotter when you set it which is something of particular benefit to myself as my temperature rises and drops all the time due to my cancer and treatment.
The bathroom was compact but had a great power shower in it that I really appreciated. Only negative was the ceiling above the shower had peeling paintwork that does need addressing ASAP.
Overall the room was great especially for the price paid. Biggest negative is the internet speed - very slow and I couldn't stream anything on my laptop during my 6 nights here which was a disappointment and limited me to the Freeview selection on the TV.
My room rate included breakfast and this was a real plus. It is a buffet-style breakfast but one of the better ones I have experienced. On arrival in the Recess restaurant each morning you are greeted and just give your room number, you are then given your table and from there help, yourself, a great selection of juices, water, tea and coffee are available to help yourself to in the bar area and the food is laid out well in the restaurant. You can have omelettes and eggs cooked fresh to order and everything else is available to help yourself. The bacon was my favourite here - a very high-quality one, sausages were good, then all the usuals such as mushrooms, scrambled egg, beans, tomatoes, hash browns etc. There is also a good continental selection of pastries, cheese, ham, cold mackeral, fruit and cereals and a selection of different bread to toast. There is also fresh waffle batter and a waffle maker available to cook yourself a fresh waffle and maple syrups, honey and sultanas to add on top. I tried one with Maple Syrup and it was delicious.
The breakfast was a highlight each day.
The staff throughout the hotel were superb, always friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The room was always cleaned and serviced perfectly each day too.
Being a member of the Hilton Honors Scheme I paid just £51 per night for my stay which is incredible value for a hotel of this calibre. The location was 5 minutes walk (for me using a walking stick with limited mobility) to Temple Meads train station and around 10 minutes to Cabot Circus which is the main shopping and leisure area so the location couldn't really be better. 
Unfortunately, I wasn't very well throughout my stay so didn't get to go see the port/docks which had been on my list to do but being in the hotel with such good staff really helped me out. I took advantage of room service most evenings which I found to be a very good value for money and of a very high standard. Every bit of food I tried was delicious and it was very welcome to have a good small plate selection on the room service menu as I struggle to eat full meals with my condition. A special mention to the ice cream which was amazing and only £2 per scoop so a nice 3 scoop serving each night was very much enjoyed. Room service was always delivered in around 15-20mins too. The only thing that could be improved is having some dishes available till later or for 24 hours as the 10 pm cut off is a bit too early at times.
Bar prices were reasonable for drinks and there is a limited selection of cold drinks and snacks available at the standard shop prices in the reception for 24 hours. 
Overall my Christmas at The Hilton Garden Inn was a very good one and I will definitely stay here again on my next visit to Bristol.
It's not perfect but for the price, it's not far off. If the wi-fi speed was better and the paintwork in the bathroom was fixed then I would have given 5 stars for the rooms instead of the 4 I have given."
420,875victoriaj,2019-12-31,3.0,"Ok for a place to sleep The room was. Ice and the bed was big and comfy however the bathroom was cramped. Having staying in many other Hilton's, this part of the brand dont provide you enough shampoo etc for 2 of you staying in a room which is disappointing.

422,colchester1232019,2019-12-31,2.0,"Less than average. For the price we paid, not worth the money. Should have stayed at Marriott's. The only good thing was breakfast. Picked this hotel because of location however turned out to be a mistake! Never staying here again. Staff were unapproachable, not welcoming at all, told us all there were no free drinking water in the hotel and that we should drink from the dirty bathroom tap! The room's cooling/heating fan was disturbingly NOISY and the bed was hard, so if you want a good nights sleep, dont stay here. Also they only have freeview channels on TV so if you're hoping to watch Netflix/Youtube or other streaming apps, get ready to be disappointed. No simple items such as slippers or robe. They provided 1 set of toiletries although we told them there were gonna be 2 people staying in the room. Everything seems to be a hassle, if you want a relaxing stay dont use this hotel! Thought we played it safe by staying at a Hilton's, but dont trust this one! Definitely not Hilton standard - more like a Travelodge."

Arrived into the room, twin room for myself and my boy (5). TV, iron and board, kettle, tea and coffee. Desk with drawers, fridge and wardrobe. Bathroom was just a shower, no bath but it came with toiletries. Shower was lovely and powerful. 

We couldn't park in the hotel carpark with arriving so late. We parked in the pay and display car park opposite. It was free from 6pm-8am then it was £1 an hour for up to 4 hours max. Not a problem for us, I went and paid £2 to get us through breakfast each morning, beats paying £16 a night for the hotel car park!. 

Breakfast, for a city centre hotel was a bargain at £9.95, my 5 year old ate free. Lots of options, full cooked breakfast, omelette made to order, waffle machine, cereals, fruits, yogurts, meats and pastries. Lots of choice and lovely. 

We didn't spend much time in the hotel as we were attending a family event locally but we will certainly be returning. 

Tip - there are lots of road works to the main road in front of the hotel and they have taken out a roundabout. Sat navs do not like this! Make sure you know where you are going, I took a few wrongs turns on the first night. This is not the hotel's fault, just be aware."
438,Southside_Travels,2019-11-30,4.0,Decent hotel in good location! Stayed here before and would use this hotel as a base again if in Bristol. It's a nice hotel with lovely staff. Didn't use the bar or restaurant so can't comment on that but rooms are decent. The location is central with a few minutes walk to the train station and the main area for shops and bars and restaurants. I would recommend this hotel.
439,Phil_jones_1,2019-11-30,2.0,"Nice hotel but parking charges are unacceptable We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Overall the staff were very pleasant, the room was nice, a little on the small size but okay, breakfast is good and overall location was fine. The real problem for me was the extortionate parking charge. We arrived at 9pm on the Wednesday evening and were informed of a £16 daily parking charge, had I of known this earlier I would never have booked this hotel, but was too late to cancel. In my opinion as guests at a hotel I believe we should be provided free parking, not charged such a high fee regardless whether or not other hotels in the area charge for parking or not. On the day of departure I was given a bill for £48, for 3 days parking. I was livid as i was leaving the hotel at 9am that morning and they were charging me for an additional 12 hrs, what a rip off. My other issue was that on the days we stayed there my car was out for most of the day. These car parking owners are making a huge amount of money for nothing. On departure I complained to the girl on the desk who was very sympathetic and very good. She told me it was a 3rd party company that ran it and there was nothing she could do but did understand my issue. Anyway she offered to deduct one payment of £16 which I accepted so ended up paying £32 instead, reducing the blow slightly. As a result of this I would never stay in a hotel again that charges for parking no matter where. I personally don’t agree with it. Why do hotels not amortise the parking across the cost of the stay and just give guests free parking, no one would know otherwise. Also why is the ground surrounding the hotel run by a 3rd party, strange, they are no doubt paying the hotel for the privilege."
440,RevDev2,2019-10-31,4.0,"Ok once you've found the way in! Overall, it's good though the dinner menu could do with an overhaul. Rooms, bar and restaurant service are good and reception is very helpful. My bugbear was actually getting to the hotel by car after dark. Major roadworks on the main approach to Temple Way prevent you turning left toward the hotel and satnav doesn't appear to have been informed."
441,EllenCara,2019-10-31,5.0,"Lovely stay A well-equipped, clean and modern hotel with a lovely range of breakfast foods. Fabulous location for anyone spending a weekend in Bristol - hotel was only 10-15 mins max to restaurants and shops and 5 mins from station. The gardens opposite are an added bonus too!"
442,michellewK5940HZ,2019-10-31,5.0,Good hotel Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights first time for us to visit Bristol and we will definitely return. This hotel is a five min walk to the train station if you go through the short cut away we learned this lol hotel is nice and clean and staff are very polite and friendly. It's not far from the shopping centre which I must say is very impressive. We ate every night due to exploring the city and Bath aswell. The 2nd night we stayed we heard very loud shouting coming from the next room around 2am in the morning and it did annoy me as some people just don't care I just hope the room was not damaged! I did report this the next morning to the front desk and they did say sorry not their fault. But didn't expect this in the hotel in a quiet area. I would return to this hotel in the near future.
443,941MSdisabled,2019-10-31,4.0,"Lion king stay over  Stayed here before bur wasn’t impressed, 
This time we had an 3rd floor room right next to the lifts as it cuts down on the walking, I’m walking disabled sometimes use a wheelchair, the room was a nice size with a coffee machine and all the extras you would expect, couldn’t open the window even a little for a little fresh air, air conditioning was a little noisy,  and the tv kept turning off,we reported it and they sent someone’s to look at it it was no better reported it again aand they came out and filled with it and went away it was no better reported again and again but it was no better, they said they could move us to another room, why not just change the tv 🙈 we said forget it 😡, apart from that it was ok, the hotel has underground parking which costs extra 🙄"

Highly recommend this hotel & would most definitely book again"
445,645zacharys,2019-10-31,5.0,"Mr When I arrived at the Hilton hotel reception staff couldn’t be more attentive and helpful. Right from the get go, I was greeted with a smile from both Maria and Peter who made the check in process smooth and hassle free, Maria kindly pointed out where important areas of the hotel were (mainly the bar) and made me feel instantly at home. It was obvious that Maria and Peter has worked together and just made it that more special and to know I was in ‘Good hands’ at the hotel, come 8:30pm I was in a rush to get to a popular bar in Bristol and had no idea where I was going or taxi numbers for that matter, Maria could see I was flustered in the lobby and kindly offered her assistance. She immediately offered to call a taxi for me and reassured me that the bar I was getting to wasn’t far, good thing as it was raining outside too! Will be sure to book in again here at the hotel and strongly recommend to anyone wanting a five star service in the city centre!"
446,RDS61,2019-10-31,4.0,"Clean and comfortable  The hotel is in a good location near the centre of the city. It does have car parking, although this costs £16 per day. The room I had was very comfortable with usual facilities such a tv, coffee making etc. Breakfast was served in the restaurant downstairs; the selection of both cooked and cold item is very good. 
Overall a good hotel to stay for a few days either on business or pleasure,"
447,ANW350,2019-10-31,2.0,"Not comfortable for women traveling alone. The desk staff bar staff, cleaners, housekeepers, and handiman's supervisor were very nice.

The night manager and one of the handymen made me feel threatened and unsafe in my room.  I very nearly left, but the receptionists and handiman-supervisor reassured me and calmed me down after a) a large man banged on my door when I was asleep at midnight, and b) a man burst into my room when I went in to take a shower, then refused to explain his presence.

Next time I'm travelling without my husband I'll book a better hotel.

Also, anything other than 100% cotton or linen is both trashy AND bad for the planet."
448,HcEve,2019-10-31,5.0,Perfect location The location was perfect. It is walking distance to the harbourside and the city centre. The staff were helpful and friendly.

Dinner and breakfast were both help yourself buffets and food was well presented and hot.  Plates not too large, but you could go round the buffet more than once.  Room temperature was by hot air blowers, bit noisy but easily turned off/adjusted.  Spacious room and shower room.   Extremely clean all round and staff extremely helpful and friendly and kind.  Overnight stay on coach trip to Bath and Longleat, great place to stay even longer."

453,candicetara,2019-09-30,4.0,"Weekend break This hotel is in ideal location for the harbour and cabot circus, it is also located in a quiet area.We had  a room over looking the park.
The room was quite small,but had everything you needed,it was very clean,the bed was firm but comfortable.
I must mention the staff has they are extremely helpful and friendly which i feel always makes a difference to your stay.
There is parking at a charge of £16 for 24 hrs, but there is limited spaces.
 I would definetly stay here again."
454,Penbay2,2019-09-30,5.0,"Very good but with a couple of minor irritations. The hotel is well located close to Temple Meads station and in walking distance of the centre of the city. 
The hotel has small but comfortable rooms. The bed was very firm but not detract from a good nights sleep. What did, however, was that the room was too hot. There was air conditioning in the room but once set it would turn itself off after a while. This resulted in me getting out of bed 4 or 5 times during the night to turn it back on again. 
The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient, except for one of the barmen who messed up our drinks order.
The breakfasts were great with a large selection of delicious offerings. I was particularly impressed with the ‘do it yourself’ waffle maker. However, there were no instructions on how to use the waffle maker which led to a lot of confusion and less than perfect waffles. Also during breakfast, the self service coffee machine was out of order for both of the 2 mornings we were there. The second morning there was a large amount of people in for breakfast as there was a tourist bus load of residents. This led to a large queue for the cramped food area and there appeared to be fewer staff then previous day, which also slowed down the service. This caused my party of 4 some anxiety as we were due to catch an early train home. 
I would have given 5 bubbles but for the above issues. 
However, I would still recommend this hotel and would return if visiting Bristol in the future."
455,petelong1968,2019-09-30,4.0,"It was good Hotel was clean, staff polite, bar reasonable. Not cheap, not expensive. Parking a bit tight for a larger vehicle and £16 for 24 hrs. Didn't have breakfast as there are a lot of options nearby. Would stay again."
456,DavidC936,2019-09-30,5.0,A really decent hotel Booked to stay for a long weekend and so glad we chose this hotel. Very convenient for the railway station and just far enough out of the city centre so you get a good nights sleep. We booked a room overlooking the park at the back of the hotel so was very quiet and good to look out on the trees in the park. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful which makes a stay worthwhile. Excellent evening meal in the restaurant and really tasty breakfasts with freshly cooked poached eggs on offer. Would definitely recommend this hotel for visitors to Bristol.
457,cltc43,2019-08-31,5.0,"Very conveniently located, compact room, good service This hotel is very convenient for Temple Meads station and main city bus routes and is a 5-10 minutes' walk from the Cabot Circus and Broadmead shopping centres.  It is next to the busy Temple Way, but the rooms at the back ('park view') are quiet (apart from, one night, bottles being crashed into a bin from a nearby pub at 5am).

Check-in was good, with a friendly receptionist.  Our room was compact - not much leeway around the bed - and the air conditioning was quite loud but the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom clean and smart.  Prices were very reasonable - close to budget levels but with a much smarter feel to the place than, say, a Premier Inn.

Breakfast was very good - staff were helpful - and there was a good selection on the buffet with eggs freshly fried at all times and other options frequently replaced.

One of Bristol's better hotels!"
458,Ninetteoa,2019-09-30,5.0,"Fabulous homely hotel Fabulous service and great friendly staff with excellent food and service would highly recommend.

Bad nights sleep. Pillows thin and had their day. Duvet was about 2 cm thick
Made a coffee and it was off. Someone must have previously opened the sachet. It was black
Reception staff kept us waiting whilst they chatted
Not impressed at all. Waste of money"

The breakfast was above average food quality which is a nice change. No powdered eggs here. Was pretty quiet when i stayed although busy so now rowdyness. Staff very helpful and the administrative mix up was quickly put right without hassle. The immediate car parking was expensive but the local small car park which is 20m away was the better option. Although situated in an office area it was only a 7min walk to Kings Street area of Bristol. Overall nice stay and will stay again."

465,H2160ABphyllisc,2019-08-31,5.0,"Another Great Hilton Experience Let me just say right off that Hilton is my #1 preferred hotel brand.  I've stayed at their properties all over the world at every price point and without fail the experience has been great.  The most impressive thing is the quality of the staff. So professional, well trained, attentive and kind, this has been my experience at every single one. This Hilton is in a great location within 8 minutes walking distance to Temple Meads train station and Bristol itself is a small city (reminds me of my native Boston, Massachusetts) and is more than a 15 minutes walk. Comfortable rooms and as always the bathroom lighting was great and flattering, another thing that I love about Hilton.  My *only* quibble was the harsh lighting in the narrow hallways - it looks like a dormitory hallway. But that is really minor.  The food in the restaurant as others have noted is very good as well.  Would stay here again."
466,francisoldfield,2019-08-31,5.0,"Comfortable and quiet Really good staff who were friendly, room was spacious, perfect temperature, completely quiet and delicious breakfast the following morning. Will be staying again next time I'm in Bristol! Internet was good as well"

We were travelling as a coach party so a huge amount of people descended for dinner and that's where this hotel came into its own, the staff were amazing how they catered for us all they were calm very pleasant smiling it was a pleasure the food was of a good standard too, 
Breakfast was exceptional and the first time anywhere that I've been you had someone out at the front cooking eggs anyway you liked to order , there was a huge choice from cereals  to full cooked 
Checkout swift and efficient to define this hotel it's got to be the staff they truly make it special a very big thank you and we'll done to you all
I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again

I found better options for a little more money in the area."

Absolutely great. For breakfast their scrambled eggs were delicious, they put a something extra in the eggs to make them extra special. Loved our stay here. Would definitely recommend you stay here if I Bristol. The hotel is close to the shopping precent of Bristol and the hotel also as it’s own car park if you’re driving. Totally enjoyed our stay!"

475,karenaE784IG,2019-07-31,5.0,"Afternoon tea-rrific Me and my boyfriend booked in for an afternoon tea as a treat. I wasn't overly keen as we weren't staying at the hotel just out for the day however I'm so glad we did. This has to me the best afternoon tea I've ever had an I've had lots. The restaurant is a bit oddly shaped and not what I was expecting but boy the food was fantastic. We were served an array of teas and coffee whilst waiting for the food.
When the food arrived shortly after I was very pleasantly surprised. We had 4 different sandwiches-egg mayo and rocket on brown, ham salad on white bread, tuma mayo and cucumber on brown and cheese and vegetable chutney on white. All were fabulously fresh and tasty. This was followed by 4 warm soft scones minus the usual bicarb taste with a large dish of clotted cream, fresh strawberries, fresh red grapes and strawberry conserve with a choice of other jams if required. Lastly was 6 large cubes of cake - ginger and lemon, white chocolate and raspberry and toffee cake. All were beautifully fresh, light and tasty.

To top it all off the staff couldn't have been nicer. 

Well done Hilton 10/10 from me. Really impressed and looking forward to my next visit already."

483,iancA5077VU,2019-06-30,1.0,Soaking costumer service  I stayed at this hotel in March this year and it was ok the room was nice and clean the corridors stunk of smoke. Then in the morning breakfast was great and the staff member who was on brilliant and great costumer service skills. The thing for me that has really spoiled my stay here is the fact I left some of my property here and went all the way to Bristol to collect it as I was instructed by house keeping that they had it. When I got there they did not have access to the room where it was. I had made a  120 mile round trip and not got my clothes. Despite this I was amicable and excepted this and agreed to them sending my property to me by post. This was on the 20th of may at the time of writing this review it is now the 28th of June. I’ve had no phone calls no emails and my property has not been returned. The hotel hasn’t even offered to comp me for my inconvenience and petrol and travel expenses for the wasted journey in may! I’ve phone again today and been told I will get a call back tomorrow. I suggested some kind of compensation as a good will gesture. Maybe a room for the night to right the wrong and show me that they do no how to provide a good service. I will write a review here to let you know how I got on. I’m not expecting much though. As the customer service has been appalling so far!

Secondly what a rock hard bed! Too hard. 
Room is clean but a small basic. We have stayed at  various hotels in Bristol and visit regularly. I chose the Hilton this time for location which is undeniable a 5 star. 
Very disappointed paying £133 for the room on a Wednesday night. Especially for this. Definitely wont stay here again."
493,grahame745,2019-06-30,5.0,"Usual very high standards A warm welcome, efficient booking in and early access to our room - a great start. We had free breakfast because we're Gold Honors members which was a nice bonus. The hotel is in a good location just  a short distance out of the centre. The room was spacious with a good shower and we had  a fantastic night's sleep with a great breakfast the following day."
494,Eat-it-up-wor-Edna,2019-06-30,5.0,"Great location, friendly staff We stayed here for a long weekend, travelling by train. The hotel is an easy 5-minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads Station. Although it's on a main road, we asked for a quiet room and got one that faces the garden.
All staff were friendly and helpful; they looked as though they enjoyed working there. The room was clean and comfortable, although a little on the small side. Breakfast was standard buffet style, but perfectly good. Again, friendly and efficient service.
The town centre is a simple 10-minute walk away across the river. We found Bristol an interesting mix of old and new with a good atmosphere.
I am not normally a fan of chain hotels, but I would be happy to recommend this one."
495,TONYORLEANS,2019-05-31,5.0,"Excellent Welcome and Staff As I was travelling around England and Wales for the cricket I chose this hotel for its proximity to the station and the town centre 
The staff were excellent, the rooms without being enormous were top quality"
496,ShropshireBorn,2019-05-31,4.0,"Convenient Walking distance from Temple Meads, City Centre and water bus stop. Helpful and pleasant staff, clean, comfortable and quiet. Good breakfasts. Users a mix of business people and tourists. Little internal noise and no external noise on the Temple Gardens side."
497,CarolineLee,2019-05-31,5.0,"Friendly staff I’ve stayed here twice now and the thing that makes it stand out is the staff. They are really professional but also friendly. Receptionists give a warm welcome and a quick checkin process. Bar and restaurant staff are friendly and cheerful. Room service man has a constant cheery demeanour. The cleaning lady gives a nice welcome too.  

Not a huge hotel and not a huge menu but the quality is good and breakfast is fabulous with everything you could want.

Parking is not cheap but it’s in the centre of the city so great location. 

Rooms are clean and fairly spacious very comfy big beds and compact shower only bathrooms. 

Price is very reasonable too. Definitely recommend."
498,Cjfh,2019-06-30,4.0,"Great staff Every member of staff I encountered was lovely!

Breakfast was good. and restaurant excellent.
Highly recommended"
500,nightrider17,2019-05-31,4.0,"Fantastic location for transport links Hotel room was average, everything was clean.  Perfect when you are planning to explore Bristol so you wouldn't be staying in the room much.  Overlooks the park.  Great breakfast with lots of choice - eggs, meat, fish, waffle maker, fruit, breads,  mushrooms, hash browns, cereals -  in fact all you could wish for.

Staff were very friendly and helpful.

Great location with a bus-stop outside - frequent buses to the attractions.  Close to Temple Meads Station too.  Main shopping area and entertainment all within 10 minutes walk."
501,joep735,2019-05-31,4.0,"Close to the station and city This hotel is in walking distance for both the city and remple meads station.  Sadly the road works make it far harder than it should be.  Rooms are clean, functional and comfortable.  Check in was easy and some free cookies a welcome treat.
Ate at the hotwl for dinner and breakfast and both were acceptable hotel food.
The bar had the football on and were happy to keep me stocked up with beer, very friendly team.

Good business choice, but would also make  good weekend break if you cane by train."
502,RobertFGCarter,2019-06-30,4.0,Handy for the railway station  I had a 0524 train to catch. This hotel is less than 10 minutes walk so was ideal. Usual Hilton attention to detail. Comfortable but firm bed. Spotlessly clean bathroom. Choice of still or sparkling water on check-in. Was only there for such a short time but will use again when I have a train to catch.
503,Quest20252927018,2019-05-31,5.0,"Great Hotel with clean rooms and brilliant service The hotel room and bathroom were very clean and tidy, every day! Great breakfast with: eggs, ham, sausages, hasbrowns, tomatoes and mushroom but also fruits, cereals, yoghurt and many more. The bar service in the evening was great, dinner a la carte in the evening slightly disappointing. Very helpful and friendly staff during!"
504,liv2177,2019-05-31,1.0,"Not impressed Check in was very stressful and my partner ended up being charged twice, but we forgot this and appreciated it might have been a blip and it was sorted. Besides this stay was fine, bed was uncomfortable to sleep on but still had a good stay. Then on check out they explained our payment was a ‘pending transaction’ it had come out of our bank but the bank hadn’t cleared it yet which they didn’t seem to understand we couldn’t do anything about, so they asked us to put our card in to verify it and my partner was charged again, overall we were charged 3 times for one stay, overall nice hotel but the reception staff seemed to have no idea what they were doing..."
505,Wisbang,2019-05-31,5.0,"Great hotel in a good location The facilities are very good.  The staff are warm and friendly.  I really enjoy staying here.
The car parking is easy and you get lovely smellies in the room.
The restaurant has a good selection.  My stay ran very smoothly.
You even get a yummy brownie on arrival!"
506,simones816,2019-05-31,5.0,"Great stay ... once again! As mentioned before I stay here when travelling on business and the service is always top notch. From the front desk, the the dining room the staff always seek proactive way to meet guest expectations. It was great to once again interact with the bartender Gennaro. His respectful charm and knowledge on wine ensure my steak was in the company of an excellent Shiraz :) 
Keep up great work and looking forward to my next visit already :)"

508,774JanC,2019-04-30,4.0,"Happy stay We stayed 3 nights here and were very happy. It was unfortunate that our first night was a Saturday and there were several hen and stag dos so pretty noisy, staff were very helpful and moved us down to floor 2 which was quiet and still had the lovely park view we had wanted.Had breakfast at the hotel and one lunch- good standard of food. Hotel short walk from station and walkable to most places in city centre, got the ferry boat back one day when we had walked down to Hotwell from Clifton.Room very good, bed excellent and bathroom really everything we wanted, shower fantastic. The thing that makes this hotel is it’s staff- all really helpful and friendly. Will stay again. Only annoying thing is that you can’t collect Hilton loyalty points unless you book direct through hotel and not through 3rd party."
509,kevannes,2019-05-31,4.0,"Good for a city break The hotel and room were lovely and the staff were welcoming enough, but I did resent having to additionally pay £16 for overnight parking. Comfortable beds, decent room size, good shower, and the amenities were all fab."
510,Garvla132,2019-03-31,4.0,"Long stay Stayed here for a week whilst working in Bristol. Hotel is very close to train station so ideal for travelling to and from airport. The hotel itself is in excellent order, my room had no issues during the week stay and had a large tv in the room. Staff were really friendly and always on hand to assist, special mention to the breakfast team, one morning I had to rush out to a meeting and they allowed me to take away a bacon sandwich and tea. The evening menu is however limited, I was unfortunately tied to a few things and as I was staying for a week had to revisit a dish or two. Food was cooked perfectly, just not a great variety. Would definitely recommend the hotel and would certainly stay again. Would love to know where you get your gin glasses from though 😂"
511,chris2pherhh,2019-04-30,5.0,"Good quality hotel near Temple Meads I've stayed in this hotel several times in the past, and it continues to be an excellent choice. Located very close to the main train station (just leave through the back exit to Temple Meads station towards the river, go across a public square and it's on the other side of Temple Way road). As one would expect, the hotel is clean and the rooms are comfortable. It has a proper fridge in each room, and a laptop sized safe. There's also a coin laundrette in the hotel, making it a good choice for longer stays."
512,williamgN3806OH,2019-04-30,5.0,"Perfect Hotel for visiting Bristol! The Hilton Garden Inn hotel is nicely situated in the heart of Bristol.

We received a warm welcome from Maria (the receptionist) that gave us the best possible overview  about all the hotel services and on what the city can offer us (with an useful map) that allowed us to save so much time, enjoying freely our holidays in Bristol.

If you are looking for a nice restaurant in the nearby, you do not need to go too far! The Restaurant Hotel RECESS is fabulous in terms of service, menu and location! Really recommended!

We also enjoyed the fitness room, it has everything we needed and we were the only ones using it, so it was quiet and fun at the same time!

We are already recommending this hotel to everyone we know and we would love to stay in this hotel again in the future.

Exceptionally good value."
516,WillStephen1972,2019-04-30,4.0,"Very nice hotel Just back from a couple nights stay at the hotel. My room was a semi flex queen room. Wasn’t the biggest room I’ve stayed in, but it was a nice room. Plenty storage space in the room with drawers and cupboards. Nice chairs, very comfy bed, fridge and safe (although the fridge never seemed to get cold), iron and iron board, and although the bathroom was small, again, everything you need was in there. The shower was lovely with excellent water pressure. Location wise, it was literally around the corner from the office, but it was also well located for getting into the city centre too. Gym was again small, but had plenty in there to use. My colleague went for breakfast and said it was lovely, and we ate in the hotel the night we arrived. The food was very good for hotel food, and the menu was more extensive from what I’m used to at this type of hotel. I’d definitely recommend this hotel whether for business visits or social visits."
517,ironlady2016,2019-04-30,4.0,"Excellent clean hotel Arrived by train to Bristol from Manchester around 2 p.m. and rooms not ready for my son and I.  Was issued a voucher for 2 drinks and the hotel kept our luggage for us.  The rooms are extremely small, I was a single in my room and cannot imagine two large people trying to move around, the bathroom was equally as small, shower just enough room to get wet.  Food very good, staff were above and beyond and friendly."
518,Grantona73,2019-04-30,5.0,"Good location, brilliant staff  Hotel was modern, clean and served up a great breakfast. Location is good, just a short walk to shops bars and restaurants.
This review though is for the staff. 
I thought they were exceptional. Polite, friendly and provided super service. Nothing was too much trouble. 
You might think ‘so what’ but you don’t always get it and this was consistent across all the staff. They were brilliant and deserve recognition"
519,344WendyB344,2019-04-30,5.0,"Lovely  I booked this hotel because it was only a mile from the destination I required and it’s very close to the city centre. 
A lovely welcome when I arrived. No hassle at all with a quick efficient check in. Staff were helpful and kind. 
Room was a good size and beautifully clean and tidy - no sign of dust or similar. Room service was quick and efficient with friendly smiley staff. 
I would highly recommend although I only stayed one night."
520,ibroadbe,2019-03-31,4.0,"Great staff Stay here regularly, staff are always very welcoming and friendly and the hotel is only a few minutes walk from temple meads and a 10 min walk to the city centre.

The hotel is a short walk from the train station and central to the shopping and waterfront areas. 
Rooms were clean and functional, fridge, kettle, iron and hairdryer. 
Restaurant was good a nice choice at breakfast and dinner. Food was lovely. 
The most important aspect which made the stay excellent was the staff. So friendly, polite and helpful every one of them. I got the impression they enjoyed their job and wanted to make guests feel welcome and happy. Thank you to all of the staff."
522,MarieOdile91,2019-03-31,4.0,"Would be a five star without other guests ruining my stay My room was very spacious, spotless and all around very pleasant. All staff encountered were polite, friendly and efficient. 
There was a stag do or something similar going on in the room next to mine and that somewhat ruined my stay as they were listening to really loud music all night, slamming doors and shouting. 
I mentioned it to the staff in the morning, without blaming them as clearly it wasn't their fault. They gave me an apology and refunded part of my stay which I thought was very generous of them as the original problem wasn't their fault. Without that, I would have had a perfect stay. 
Thank you for putting the customer first, I will be back."

525,bazandjenny,2019-03-31,3.0,"Good location and reasonable meal options Located across the road from an historic church with a small park and near the centre of Bristol, the Hilton Garden Inn is a reasonably new hotel with clean rooms and comfortable beds.

I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip.  The buffet breakfast is fairly good and some of the meal options for lunch and dinner were great and some a bit ordinary.  My favourites were the Piri Piri Chicken wrap and the British Beef Pie. I wasnt a fan of the crispy salt and pepper squid, a bit bland and not very crispy.

I enjoyed walking around the area local to the hotel.  There is also a gym if you want exercise but the weather isnt good outside.

I would stay here again and recommend it to my colleagues."
526,TomasC859,2019-03-31,4.0,"Perfect location A group of us visited the Hilton recently for a trip to Cheltenham. Perfect location in Bristol and close to the train station. Dinner and Breakfast was lovely. Rooms were clean, a bit on the small side but other than that all was good.
The staff were very friendly and willing to help  with all requests."
527,iancA5077VU,2019-03-31,3.0,Average The hotel was clean but I could smell smoke at one point pin the hallway I think someone was having a sneaky fag. The night staff were a bit moody but I suppose late nights and weekend drunks from stags and hens probably takes its toll. The best part of the stay was breakfast in the morning particularly the staff member jaylene from the philopenes. She was so friendly and polite it made my stay that little more special she couldn’t do enough and made me feel appreciated as a customer

Check in was quick and the receptionist was really friendly and pleasant.
My room was large and clean, with modern furnishings and a comfortable bed. It seemed to be in a much better condition than other HGI's I've stayed in.
The bar was reasonably priced but the service wasn't great. Breakfast was very good, with a wide selection and good quality produce.
All in all a very pleasant hotel, and I'd be happy to return."
542,altravels,2018-08-31,1.0,"If I could give it a 0 I would Well, for a Hilton I have never been so sorely disappointed and appalled by the manor of staff. Booked online, and our payment was rejected 2 times. We tried a 3rd time and didn't get a rejection, in fact got confirmation of this. We got a flight down from Newcastle and arrived just after midnight - in a city we have never been to and shattered from the journey. We walked into reception to be told our reservation had been cancelled and that instead of the £300 we should have paid that they had no more room other than a room that was just over £2,000 for the same amount of time. Needless to say I wasn't very happy and luckily I had printed out my confirmations, where I was still questioned as to why it had been cancelled. Why he was asking me I'm not sure because I had the confirmation and had travelled long enough for them to surely know that this was an error on their own booking system. I was not offered an apology and was reluctantly told that they would offer the 'same' room for the price we should have originally paid. Now, if I had paid £2000 for the room we received I would have been fuming it was disgusting, lights not working and stains on the carpet. Rude staff and was made to feel unwelcome. Definitely would steer people away from any Hilton from now on! Massively let down from this worldwide brand - nothing special and in fact was below par of a premier inn."

548,kolive10,2018-12-31,2.0,"Not very forthcoming Don't get me wrong, the hotel itself is very nice. The room I had was spacious and the bed was comfortable. You will hear people slamming doors and talking in the hallways. However, I gave my rating based on what the staff didn't tell me when I checked in. When I checked in I saw there was a restaurant and mentioned that I was hungry and would have to come down to eat after in put my stuff away. There seemed to be a party of some kind going on. I wasn't told anything at the time. However the staff moved me from a 1st floor room to the 2nd floor. I thought that was nice. Then I went down to eat and found out I couldn't eat at the restaurant because it was a private event. I went out to eat then came back to my room. The music was loud even on the 2nd floor. It was 10:00 PM and I called the front desk. I was told the party was going to go on till midnight. They did offer me another room but it was on the 1st floor! That's where the party is. Why would a hotel that had a LOUD party going on till midnight put customers in rooms that the noise from the party would bother you? I can't believe that a ""Hilton"" hotel would do this. I will make sure to not stay in another Hilton hotel while in Europe when this is the way management plans and thinks of its hotel customers. NOT a happy customer"

550,arsenal7533,2018-12-31,3.0,"Budget hotel, very basic, average service  I stayed 3 weeks in this hotel in November. Convenient location close to Temple Mead station. Modern budget hotel. Very basic equipment. Rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny. Air conditioning is noisy. Front desk staff is polite and nice. Restaurant staff are inefficient and incompetent with arrogant management. They supposedly offer a breakfast and diner deal. No matter how many staff I asked about it I never managed to book it once in 3 weeks. Restaurant staff asked me to check with front desk and front desk said it had nothing to do with them. I also was asked to pay cash for room service despite having opened an account upon arrival. The room above the restaurant are noisy. For the same price in Bristol there are better hotels."

The service was consistently great, wonderful helpful staff who always went the extra mile to ensure guests were happy!
The rooms are very comfortable, beds super comfy, great showers in the bathroom and always immaculate.
The breakfast selection is superb for a chain business hotel, it even has a waffle maker!
It’s location is perfect for Temple Quay and it’s a short walk from the city centre.
The hotel has a smallish onsite car park which is secure with barrier exit and cctv.
Would definitely recommend this as a great place to stay!"

Good position, near to the station temple meads and not that far from centre and Cabot circus. 
5 star! For the environment, position  and the staff!"
554,Doryislost,2018-11-30,5.0,"A good base for visiting Bristol A nice centrally based hotel, easy walking distance from Bristol Temple Meads train station and close to the city centre.  Rooms are quite basic but sufficient for a short city break, with a very comfortable bed and everything you’ll need in the room (hairdryer, iron, ironing board). The shower room is very good with a lovely shower. At nearly £150 a night though, I think breakfast should be included in the price."
555,simones816,2018-11-30,5.0,"Friendly staff and excellent location Stayed here a few times whilst travelling on business. Excellent location within walking distance from the station. Rooms are clean and reception staff very friendly. I ordered Room Service and the food was good although there is a tray charge added to the bill.
There was a bit of confusion when I payed cash and requested a VAT receipt (I was given a restaurant check in lieu of the receipt...), however the issue was promptly and efficiently resolved by the Front Desk, who organised what I needed in an envelope ready to be delivered to my Room. Also worth mentioning the bar tender Gennaro, who was extremely friendly  who was able to make recommendations with good knowledge of the offer available. He also went out of his way to give me some informations and directions I needed for the following day. Overall an excellent stay."
556,nothingwitty,2018-11-30,3.0,"Friendly staff, but not impressed by wet patch by my bed Stayed here for one night on business trip. Warm greeting at reception. Food in restaurant was good, though it was odd to see people walking around in their pyjamas and bare feet. 

Bedroom was large and had everything needed for a business stay. Quite corporate so not a place I would choose for a leisure stay. What looked like a large double bed was two single beds put together, a pet hate of mine.

I initially visited my room to drop off my bag and then went downstairs for dinner. On returning to the room I prepared for bed. Standing by the bed I noticed my foot was wet and looked down to see what looked like the remnants of a vomit spray under me, right by the side of the bed you would most likely use to get into bed. See photo. I tried to convince myself it was coffee or water but it just didn't look like it. It looked like someone had tried to clean it but it was still wet when I arrived and I do think there was a smell from it. Had to wash my feet and then get into bed on other side to avoid stepping in it again. 

I won't be staying here again because of this."
557,jeffkelly561,2018-11-30,5.0,"Excellent stay Stayed here and it was excellent. Close to train Station and about 10 mins walk in the centre.
Met with a big smile.
Room was just what we wanted. 
Great Queen size bed and shower was great. 
Only complaint is were the hair dryer and iron board is kept, we needed to open a few cupboards before we found them.
Breakfast was a buffet and a fantastic choice hot and cold. 
Would we stay here again a big YES."
558,traveller693789,2018-09-30,5.0,"Excellent repeat trip to The Hilton Garden Inn in Bristol A year on we re-visited this hotel and had the same excellent experience.  Very professional check in from Annie again, this time we had 2 rooms booked, and again had a room overlooking the attractive garden area.
The breakfast buffet was good in terms of both quality and quantity again, I particularly enjoyed the freshly baked warm artisan bread.
We have already booked to stay again next year.  The hotel is in a very convenient location, a short walk from both Temple Meads Station and the attractive riverside area.  We managed to get the last parking space so parking can be a bit tight.  The rooms/bathrooms are on the small side but have everything you need.  I would definitely recommend."

The shower was excellent as were the amenities. 

We ate in the restaurant one evening and the food was delicious and good value. 

All in all, a lovely friendly hotel that I would recommend."

561,TeriMT1,2018-11-30,5.0,"Excellent customer service The staff made this hotel excellent. Professional, personable, responsive, friendly, helpful. The hotel itself was a pleasant and clean environment to be in, with a reasonable breakfast and we'll equipped room. 
Generally a little cramped, and being on the ground floor sleep was interrupted by noise (early morning cleaners etc). Nowhere to hang towels except one small hook on bathroom door, limited space for suitcase etc. Overall very pleased with my stay and would happily come again."
562,Thrunthru,2018-11-30,4.0,"Great location for business travellers - even better staff A consistenty high standard at a good price and location - and my first choice - a trusted brand.   Got to mention Tilla, what a great guy in the bar area , humerous, happy and attentive - how good to see someone happy in their work.

Really good lounge area for those 121 business meetings with coffee."

This hotel is in a good location ....easy walking distance to the Theatre and waterfront.
Just as important is service and we received excellent service from the front desk. Peter even lent us his umbrella as it had started to rain.  That was so thoughtful and kind.
Room was comfortable and quiet.
Parking is not cheap though at the hotel but it didn’t spoil our stay."

Bathroom felt a little dated.

The breakfast in the restaurant was really decent however, a great selection."
565,Ambassador821281,2018-10-31,4.0,"Excellent BUDGET hotel Excellent, friendly, warm and clean. The hotel is a five minute walk from the railway station and a ten minute walk into the main shopping area. I asked for a quiet room and was allocated room 305 which was very quiet when you consider you're in a city hotel. The room was small, but very clean, warm but not overly so. The staff were very friendly and helpful. If you want lots of service, newspapers etc then this is not the hotel for you as it is a BUDGET hotel after all, one gets what one pays for. I would not hesitate in returning to this hotel, for a quick trip it was just the job. P.S. we never had any food in the hotel as we were fully aware at time of booking that it was a budget hotel so we planned to eat out."
566,366naomim,2018-10-31,1.0,"Shocking service Awful stay for business. The staff are unfriendly, the facilities basic. The room service menu looked awful (overpriced fast food), so I ordered some food from elsewhere. They shouted at the delivery man for stepping into the lobby to meet me, then shouted at me for defending the poor guy. Missing basic things like the option of a newspaper or wake up call, a bath, flannels, etc. The room is cold, even with the heating on max. The TV keeps cutting out, too. 

I’ve always stayed at the Marriott Royal for trips to Bristol, and I’ll continue to do so in future."

Not this time though, said sandwich fillings were on voucher and we had to have this, egg mayonnaise, tuna - yuk! Would have been easier to say we had fish/egg allergy! Would have been happy with all ham/cheese. Very disappointed and wouldn’t come here again. Gave a 3* as the staff were very friendly."
568,BharathP35,2018-10-31,3.0,"Friendly staff. Good Breakfast. Small rooms. Unclean carpets Good: Staff were friendly. Breakfast was fairly good. Bedding was good quality and TV was a decent size.
Bad: Room was small size. Room carpets were not vacuumed and this alleviated my dust allergy symptoms through the night. Also, there was no water bottle placed in the room which is expected for the cost of the room per night and the standard (star rating) of the hotel."
569,LucyLocket_7,2018-10-31,5.0,Service lessons other hotels could learn from Booked this hotel for a short stay in Bristol due to factors which included a good rate for a  Dinner/B&B package and the proximity to Temple Meads.  Before our visit I had a couple of queries which were answered with speed and efficiency and put my mind at rest.  Although only a short stay was impressed with the service we received from Reception and at Dinner.  Room of a decent size and good quality toiletries also.  Thanks Bristol I am sure on another visit we will return.
570,Wolfwatcher06,2018-10-31,2.0,Rock hard A slab of concrete would be more comfortable to sleep on. I am seriously considering sleeping in my car. Not somewhere I would recommend if you need a comfortable soft mattress to avoid chronic back pain.

572,VeronicaStokeontrent,2018-10-31,4.0,"Lovely room and breakfast Went on a 2day trip to Bath and Longleat with GB tours and enjoyed it very much.
Our hotel room number 132 was really nice and comfortable with tea and coffee facilities, a fridge and a safe. Really clean with plenty of wardrobe and drawer space for all our things. Small but lovely bright bathroom with toiletries and white fluffy towels.
Breakfast was buffet style with everything you could want, and of a good quality, really enjoyed it. Our evening meal was the only negative for us and all on our coach party. We were told we had to be down for our meal by 6pm and when we arrived the staff were dragging tables and chairs around and trying to set tables, it was very chaotic and very noisy and unpleasant. When we eventually were able to queue for our meal with our plates we did not know what food was there, no signs saying what the food was at all. The main meal was some kind of stew, think it was pork but as I say there was no information as to what food was was in the containers we served ourselves. Very poor indeed and the only downside to our trip."
573,leanneg741,2018-10-31,5.0,Excellent location for exploring Bristol city centre  What a lovely hotel with lovely friendly staff . Hotel room was well laid out with nice selection of teas and coffees and some nice toiletries. Bed were comfy. Unfortunately our Neighbours were very noisy the night we stayed but hotel was quick to sort out.  5 min walk to Cabot circus which has a great mall and lots of nice eateries and 3 min walk to train station to explore further a field. Highly recommend taking a train to bath if your there for a few days.

575,ARF3,2018-10-31,4.0,"Good in a semi-bland way but with expensive parking Relatively easy to find and navigate to. Good location, situated about 5 minutes of Temple Meads Station and within about 4 minutes of a large Wetherspoon pub the Knights Templar and quite close to a lot of other restaurants, pubs and cafes. However, I've had warmer receptions on arrival but I don't think they liked it when I questioned how much the parking was, £16, which I was informed was one of the cheapest in Bristol. Personally, and I've found this an ever growing issue, I really dislike finding a good price for a hotel, then finding there is an additional - often quite substantial - cost for parking but it isn't necessarily apparent. Please advertise it up-front and stop blaming the cost on second party car park companies when it's within your boundaries – mini-rant over. Now to the rooms, good standard, with everything you need but like with many chain hotels in a semi-bland way. While the hospitality tray had mostly good quality products, the coffee really, really, wasn't great, it's a shame that I don't drink decaf because that was Rombouts, no biscuits though. The bathroom had good quality toiletries and the towels were good but the toilet area was really quite cramped (it’s as small as it looks) and there wasn't a lot of room at the sink (again the photo says it all). While the shower was plenty big enough, with a door that made entry and exit easy, the pressure wasn't great. I didn't eat, so can't comment on the food and I only had one drink in the bar, which was a half of Stella Cidre for £2.60, which is about what you would expect in a hotel. Check-out was quick and uneventful. My overall rating would be good if that were an option (come on TripAdvisor), because it really was better than average but not to the very good level that I’ve marked it as."
576,54Ken_S,2018-10-31,4.0,"Dinner was disappointing Stayed overnight as part of a coach tour and felt disappointed by the evening meal , we queued for the two choice starter of pate or soup and they ran out of bread. We then queued for the two choice main course and it had been kept warm from the original meal time of 1800hrs we ate at 2000hrs . We felt like second class guests in a very good hotel . Check in was efficient and two members of staff in the bar and restaurant stood out for excellence , attentive and helpful , rescuing our evening . Michael & Tilla . 
Room was immaculate . 
Music in the dining room should either be turned off or system replaced , indiscernible and competing with the football on the TV . Not a great atmosphere when dining ."

579,Gnahh,2018-09-30,3.0,"Mediocre. Hilton in the UK really doesn't have the same standard as international locations. Only a tiny step up from a premier inn.  On a standard room; Bathroom was clean but cramped, size of a cupboard. No early check in available. No 24hour room service. No free parking (parking seemed over priced too considering you're already paying to stay there). No real acknowledgement of Hilton honors status. Limited communal areas.

The breakfast was the best thing about the stay. 

Staff were friendly and polite.

I wouldn't stay here again. Not good value for money."
580,Hoptonjohn,2018-09-30,4.0,Handy for the city centre and station Check in was friendly and professional. The room was nice and quiet on the 5 floor. Breakfast is a good choice of hot and cold items with fresh cooked eggs. I guess the let down was the parking cost at £48 for 3 nights. The shower was good and all in all would stay again just without the car
581,genghis15,2018-09-30,4.0,"Modern Hotel, Does the Job, Great staff Just had the one night here visiting for a gig. The rooms are basic but modern, adequate, clean and functional.

582,lisa026,2018-09-30,4.0,"Wonderful front desk staff This is a very nice, clean hotel that will give you a good nights sleep. The rooms/bathroom are small tho and they could add the little extra touch of having something in the mini bar, there was not even a bottle of water.We enjoyed our lunch there also, bit on the expensive side but great service. But what made our stay very enjoyable was the staff. We had some personal trouble during our trip and they did everything possible for us. For that reason, I will always stay there again while in Bristol, I felt very welcome and cared for."
583,362nadiaa,2018-02-28,5.0,"Amazing breakfast and beautiful hotel  I stay in a lot of Hilton hotels and sometimes find they can be a hit or miss. 
The garden inn though is exceptional. Staff were friendly and welcoming , rooms are clean comfy and cosy. Gym Is small but clean and all equipment works and is accessed with a key card which makes getting a work out in flexible. 
Hotel has a car park which is pretty expensive but there is a council car park opposite which I believe is free from around 6 or 7pm. Bristol city centre is about a 10 minuet walk away and temple meads station is about a 5 minuet walk. This hotel is great for anyone visiting the city for pleasure or on business. Breakfast is downstairs in the bar and was also exceptional. Plenty of choice from hot and cold foods including fruit, cereal , pastry’s, breads, sausage, bacon, beans, eggs, spreads like Nutella, jam etc and teas coffees and juices. If you are staying I would defiantly recommend adding the breakfast."

It started with our room having a double bed in spite oh having specifically requested twin beds.that was corrected. The room was pedestrian and so small that after putting down our suitcases, there was hardly any space to move around. And the attached bathroom was of the size you find on standard cabin on a cruise ship. Just drying oneself involved a feat of acrobatics. Come on guys...this is a Hilton we’re talking about. Don’t you care anymore?"

We then got upgraded to free breakfast which the hotel paid for to celebrate our special occasion :) staff were great, breakfast was incredible, bit further out of the center of bristol than I would’ve liked but it was ok because we had the car..

Downsides.. parking is a joke, £15 per night is ridiculous.. but after driving into town we saw that actually, all of beistol is over priced!!! Multistorey car park was £3.50 for 30 mins. Also, beds werent as comfy as I thought they should have been. A bit of a let down as i didnt sleep well. But overall a pleasant stay!"
594,KYB0001,2018-07-31,1.0,"difficult to park, no water, small room The hotel was easy to find but finding the entrance to the parking lot was impossible. The hotel was surrounded by complex one-way roads, we spent more than an hour trying to find a way in but gave up at the end and parked somewhere else. Later found out that the way to drive to the parking lot is by driving to the nearby Novotel, drive through the hotel building (underneath) following their 'parking' sign, then instead of turning right into their underground parking lot just keep driving straight to the end of the road and the entrance to the Hilton parking lot appears on your right. When we arrived at the hotel, the parking lot was full any way (we couldn't have parked even if we found the entrance). This hotel may be convenient for guests walking from Bristol Temple Mead train station but not good for people arriving by car. In the afternoon, there was no water in the entire building (no shower, no toilet in the room, no water even in the toilet in the lobby). We had to use a toilet so went to the Novotel next door and told them that we were staying at Hilton but there was no water in the hotel so would like to use their toilet. They kindly let us use the toilet in their lobby. What a fiasco! The room was really small but clean. The hotel looks likely an upmarket version of Holiday Inn Express. The shower room was tiny. The rooms in this hotel is probably OK for a solo business traveller, but aren't adequate for a couple. The receptionist was arrogant and rude. Breakfast was disappointing. Next time we will stay in Novotel next door."

599,PD_469,2018-08-31,4.0,"A good hotel Stayed here many times on business. Also sometimes use Doubletree but prefer the ambience and good at this hotel by some margin.

It took me a while to realise that there was a shortcut from Temple Meads station (months silly me) but with an exit to the side it is 5 minutes pleasant walk to the hotel. 

There is limited scope for Honours recognition as the rooms are pretty much all the same. I prefer the rooms facing away from the road although they do get the afternoon sun. The bar area though is great, really good, and the food is good value and good quality especially with the daily specials. 

Not sure I would stay here with family, the rooms are nice and clean but quite compact. Perhaps I would choose Doubletree if space was a priority.

Overall though - really good. And the staff are always polite, friendly and welcoming. A small bonus when you are a relatively frequent visitor."

So overall an excellent stay for us"
602,yhi904,2018-08-31,4.0,"Good place to stay close to Temple Meads station The property is just a few minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads station.  It is walkable into the City Centre or there are a number of buses which stop outside the hotel - whether you walk or bus it is about 15 minutes to the centre.
My check-in and check-out were both efficient and some discrepancies on the final invoice were quickly rectified.
The room is a standard for this type of hotel - everything you need, compact but not squashed together.  There is a good sized desk for working and a comfortable chair at the desk.  The room safe is big enough for a full-size laptop.  Plenty of hanging and drawer space.  Usually tea/coffee hospital tray - Earl Grey tea a nice touch!  Bathroom is basic but good shampoo/shower gel provided.  Limited choice of TV channels; and this is frustrating as so many hotels - including this one - have not retuned following recent Freeview channel changes - so there are even less channels than before!
There are few places in the immediate vicinity to eat so I opted for the in-house restaurant on both evenings.  Food was well prepared and good sized portions.  As with any hotel, the menu offerings are limited, but you could eat here for several nights without repetition.  The breakfast selection was great - including waffle maker, several types of bread and kippers - makes a change from the same ""bacon, sausage and egg buffet"" which is the only choice at so many other hotels.
Why only four stars?  Well the room was very warm and the aircon noisy - Perhaps that is the result of our recent and untypical hot weather."

Arrived early as only from Cardiff but had beautiful weather and wanted to see as much as we could. We were very fortunate and were able to book in early. 

Our room was overlooking the park on the 4th floor. Lovely and quiet and great air con. 

Ate at the hotel in the evening and food was delicious as was breakfast the following morning. Everything piping hot. Lovely. Would I stay here again. Absolutely. Will be looking at the weather over next fortnight and if I can get another good deal with Hilton Honours will book again. So much to see and do especially with a bit of sunshine."

Due to England playing in the world cup and rather than trying to squeeze into a local bar on a very warm evening we opted for the patio at the rear of the hotel which was showing the match on a outside TV. Surprising the food was very good and the service excellent and all in all we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening.

Complained when I checked out the next morning and the guy said oh yeah we've been having problems with the central computer that controls the units. Would have been nice of him to tell me that before I paid £100 for a sleepless night or better yet actually fixed it.

Also found several blood stains on the duvet cover which was gross but luckily didn't notice until I was about to leave

Breakfast was quite good so only rating as poor overall. Fresh poached eggs and a very wide selection."
606,Muckman1,2018-07-31,5.0,"Excellent Stopped here for a few days and this hotel was a great place to be as it’s so close to all the amenities and sites of Bristol. Perhaps the great summer weather helped butwe had a wonderful time here. The staff were great, helpful and rooms were as expected, clean, well appointed and roomy. If I stopped in Bristol again I would stay here."
607,goodluk,2018-07-31,4.0,"Good Experience  A quick overnight stay, but a great friendly check-in, efficient check-out and a functional room.  Rooms are on the small size but hey - bed, desk and shower and I’m happy. 

Good location close to the centre, about a ten minute walk to the main heart. Didn’t eat in the restaurant. 

Nothing bad to say about the hotel, it lives up to the brand expectations and a great choice for a quick overnight stay. It was my first Garden Inn and I was pleasantly surprised."
608,Jannerbloke,2018-07-31,3.0,"Not bad but ran out of sirloin steak. Here for work, room and bed good for badly needed full nights sleep. Had been booked a twin but was offered a disabled room which had a bigger bed and bathroom and was also quieter at the back. Decided to eat in and ordered a sirloin steak only to be told later they had none left but I stepped back and was pleasantly surprised by the house club sandwich. A very warm evening and back in the room the efficient air conditioning turned out to be too loud, so I turned it off only to awake at 3am in stifling heat and had to turn it back on. I then slept through. Breakfast was a short walk along the corridor, a pity though that the waffle machine had been removed or was off on duty elsewhere. I don’t mind being booked in here, it’s as good as any of the others in the keenly priced middle bracket."
609,30mandyp,2018-07-31,4.0,"Lovekt One night stay whilst we visited Bristol for the harbour festival. Room was very clean, fresh and cool due to the a/c - in this heatwave we were very grateful for it. Shower was great. Only downside for us was the bed wasn’t particularly comfortable, but we know you can’t please everyone with everything. Fab breakfast. Friendly staff. City Centre location, very low noise from outside."
610,Globaltraveller1668,2018-07-31,4.0,Nice clean hotel Had a comfortable stay here with my daughter for 5 nights at the beginning of July.  A decent hotel with everything you need.  Allocated a room facing the Temple Garden which was quiet.  Shower was good and powerful.  Breakfast was very good and gym facililates were adequate.  Hotel staff all very helpful.  Good location.  Will not hesitate to stay here again if in the area.
611,605arthurf,2018-07-31,3.0,Business location It is a typical  HGI..Great location for the business traveler..Two minute walk to the train station and is close to restaurants and shops.  The staff is very helpful and is willing to help you acquire ground transportation.  I am thinking of staying there again in a couple months
612,bootneck309,2018-07-31,4.0,"overnighter Comfortable hotel in the centre of bristol, although a bit of a pain to get to if driving; due to the road works In the centre of town. Would have stayed elsewhere if we'd known about them. However room was modern and bed comfortable.  Breakfast was ok and plentiful."
613,tonysony,2018-06-30,4.0,"Good little place for a night It's a nice airy building, professional staff and everything gives the impression of it being a decent business hotel.  Shame they gave me the wrong key first time around but they sorted it out straight away.  I had a good size bed, it was quiet, everything worked well and easily including the TV and aircon which often require (non-existent) instructions manuals to figure out.  All in all, a decent stay."
614,Q5573TZalexw,2018-07-31,4.0,"Great base for a short stay.  This was a great base for our short trip to Bristol. Only 5 mins walk from the station and about 10-15 from the water. 

Rooms were spacious, clean and modern and had everything we needed (although bottled water would have been nice). 

There was lots of choice for breakfast which I'd definitely recommend. We also ate in the restaurant for tea one night which wasn't as good - there are probably better options.

I'd definitely consider staying again if I was in the area."
615,tjoe72133,2018-05-31,5.0,"Ideal for business Great location + parking. Friendly reception, clean room very quiet for city centre. Great breakfast, easy checkout. Would recommend for short business trips. This will be my third here and it is consistently good. Room service was excellent."
616,rital746,2018-06-30,5.0,"Amazing staff I and my sister stayed 3 nights for her birthday.  The room was clean and fully air conditioned. The staff were so friendly and could not do enough for us.  The housekeeping staff cleaned our room daily. And we got complimentary drink for my sister's birthday. All the bar staff kitchen staff reception staff  made us feel at home. We will be staying there again.
Location is great too. Walking distance to train station bars cafes and shops. Thank you for making my sister's birthday special.🤗🤗😘"

618,cassyandv,2018-06-30,5.0,"A memorable stay! Me and my friend stayed here as we got offered a good deal with a travel company. Clean rooms, polite staff, great location and parking is offered. We were also allowed to park for the rest of the day, even after we had checked out which was a massive help. The best part of our stay was without a doubt the efforts of the reception team! Big shout out to Diageo and the two other gentlemen working that night, 29/06/18."
619,postypaulh,2018-06-30,5.0,"Location,staff,breakfast and rooms all first class My first point of contact was Kelly  reservation agent who adhered to all my requests .I asked if I could have two rooms on the same floor preferably next to each other with possibly an early check in . This was the blueprint for all the staff  as Kelly was  courteous and friendly.  On reception was Annie who was gregarious and down to earth ,just what you need after tackling Bristol roadworks and traffic.She took time out to ask about our UB40  concert and made our arrival  pleasant. We were offered breakfast for under £10 which is an excellent deal as Hilton  take a pride in their breakfasts. Our room without being large was modern with full natural light and yes our  rooms were indeed next to each other. There is a Weather spoons  within a five   minute walk and the Waterfront is a fifteen minute causal stroll.The breakfast was first class with a good choice including waffles and omelettes made to order.On leaving Dahye on reception continued the vein of excellent customer service giving us all chilled bottles of water for our drive home. The management deserve credit for putting the customer first .Well done to all concerned."
620,alisonAberdeenshire,2018-06-30,5.0,"Good city centre hotel Had just one night at this hotel and was very happy with all aspects of our stay. The hotel is a easy walk into centre/shops and looks out on to a lovely quiet street with a small park across the road.
Nice,efficient reception and our room was very comfortable and clean with all the amenities we would expect.
We took advantage of the special offer at reception to add evening meal and breakfast and both were very good and good value. 
Would recommend."
621,jjd2015,2017-11-30,4.0,"Clean and modern property This hotel is located in between Temple Meads Station and the city making it convenient. My room was comfortable, clean and tidy. Wifi was fast too. Breakfast was especially good which the desk decided to comp."
622,ICT-FAN,2018-06-30,4.0,"Central hotel close to station. Hotel only 5-10 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads station. Check in very efficient. Room average size and fridge very handy in the hot weather for our 4 night stay. Room overlooking park was very quiet.
Good choice for breakfast although sausages and black pudding often overcooked and dry. Eggs tended to be done in large batches and could have been better if done on demand. 
Hated loud music in restaurant area - why so loud and monotonous. Had to ask for sound to be turned down at least once.Music stopped us from  dining in hotel on one evening during our stay. Bar prices could be a little lower.
Staff were excellent in all areas of hotel.
In summary good location ,  quiet area particularly rooms facing park. Complain about music if necessary."
623,KathAndBuddy,2018-06-30,5.0,Lovely afternoon tea We visited for a Groupon afternoon tea. It was a beautifully sunny day and we ate on the terrace. They couldn’t do enough for us. The afternoon tea was great. The sandwiches were good and the cakes were great - especially the lemon drizzle cake. Lovely glass of prosecco and a large selection of teas. We ordered coffee at the end and when I went to pay was told there was no charge. Highly recommended.
624,287silverfox,2018-06-30,5.0,"Ideal - if you're not driving ! First visit/stay for one night in order to record a TV show locally.
Friendly reception staff when nothing was too much trouble. Bar food available until 1000pm , which is so sensible , as arrival having been delayed owing to late flight.
Room clean and comfortable with comprehensive shower facilities . 
Breakfast served from 0600 (again , so sensible as my car to studio arrived at 0650) .
Food delicious with an eye watering choice of fare from cooked to various cold meats, croissants , cheeses etc.
Would jump at the chance of staying again !
Only downside seemed to be that the local authorities in Bristol are seriously anti-traffic (of any sort) which - apart from endless roadworks - hamper getting about with any ease and IF you can ever find a parking space , one will need a second mortgage to leave it there !"
625,S9347SGandyb,2018-04-30,4.0,"Nice hotelI I was there on business so I didn't see any of the surrounding area but the hotel  was very good and I would recommend it. The food was very good and so was the friendly service. The room and en suite was almost perfect , the only drawback was a tiny little window at the corner of the room meant that there was no view although I suppose that it made the room more private"
626,IanT1700,2018-05-31,4.0,"Overnight Stay - Work Night Out HGI is in great location for Temple Meads and Temple Quay businesses. It’s a 10min walk in to centre of Bristol so very convenient.
I’ve stayed here a lot so I appreciate the consistency of the service and experience.
Room was decent, clean and comfortable. Modern furnishings, tea/coffee, iron, free wi-fi and nice bathroom. Air con wasn’t switched on and I forgot to turn it on so felt a bit hot and furry after a night out the following morning! It is a warm hotel so switch it on when you arrive!
Breakfast is good. Nice buffet of hot and cold options. Good strong coffee.
Good hotel - I will keep staying here when overnighting in Bristol!"
627,ChristineLangton,2018-06-30,3.0,Not really city centre as proclaimed On the main road temple way not in city centre as said there is a number 8 bus outside that does a circular tour that takes you to centre and other attractions like the zoo  outside of hotel can walk it not sure how long it would take at back nice little park with couple of cute pubs walk through and turn left supermarket the park has a ruined church and beautiful roses the rooms are clean fridge not working staff seemed help full parking in front of hotel  town  has lots of shops eating places but not round hotel
628,cde2014,2018-05-31,4.0,"Good hotel, great value A friend and I stayed at this hotel for four nights as we explored Bristol and the area. Not only was it a fantastic location for us because it is so easily accessible to Temple Meads but its value was increased by helpful front desk staff who were always happy to give directions, make recommendations and generally answer all questions. The included breakfast and the morning breakfast staff were the best start to the day that a visitor could hope for. I can't say that I recommend ending the day with a glass of wine in the bar/restaurant; the staff were pretty inattentive at what must be a slow time for them."
629,nectariap,2018-06-30,3.0,"Afternoon Tea We got a £50 deal for afternoon tea at this hotel, we were so disappointed. Both the sandwiches and (not-your-expected) afternoon tea cakes were clearly bought from the local newsagent in plastic packaging and displayed on a board. Lowest quality of bread and fillings, very disappointing, I should've taken some photos! The staff were friendly but inattentive. 
The environment was a bit functional and corporate, it's not the place for overpriced afternoon tea!"
630,JoeM773,2018-06-30,5.0,"Great hotel I stayed here for 1 night as was working for the day. Flight arrived early meaning I arrived at the hotel around 10am. The reception staff told me I could check in around noon, 3 hours earlier than normal which was great.

The room was great & the bed very comfy & had everything I needed. Iron, ironing board & fridge.

Breakfast was fantastic and being opened from 6am was lovely as I had to leave for work at 7am. Very central with the train station 10 minute walk away.

Peter at reception was great as was the younger guy who unfortunately I didn't catch his name. I think he may have been Spanish.

All in all great hotel close to the city centre & world stay again."
631,Londinium,2018-06-30,3.0,"Basic Hilton but well located If you are used to the 'classic' Hilton hotels as I am, then you might be disappointed here. The hotel is well located: 5 minutes away from the station and 15 minutes from the shopping centre. Staff members are nice and helpful. Unfortunately, not possible as in other Hilton hotels to order additional towels and pillows so we had to do without. The room is clean indeed but there was a strong smell of Javel when we entered - we quickly opened the small window to make it disappear as quickly as possible. I found our twin room much smaller than on the photos but it was still OK. The bathroom is ridiculously small, and getting hot so quickly that we had to leave its door open when taking a shower. There is no place to put you clothes in there either. There is a large safe in the room, as well as tea/coffee facilities too, and a fridge where you may store your own food/drinks. Our room was facing the back of the hotel, a good choice since the front rooms are on a very busy and noisy street. We generally had a good sleep, if only people coming back late or leaving very early in the morning would mind not slamming doors (especially when it's only 5.30 AM) ... and the doors are slamming very noisily so we were waken up several times. The breakfast is served in the restaurant but there's nobody to welcome you, you just enter and figure out what table is free thanks to a green/red toss placed on them. The buffet is restricted but you can order from the kitchen. I had a cheese and ham omelette which was really tasty. We did not have drinks or dinner there but there are some special offers if you are interested. In summary, it's not as food as a classic Hilton hotel, I would rate it as at 3-start only, but it's more than OK to spend 1 or 2 nights there."
632,CheshirePauline,2018-06-30,4.0,Stop off before Longleat Really nice hotel. Good food and room and the little park across the way with the The Kights Templar Church was lovely. Quite a few pubs local but the hotel terrace was excellent.  I would recommend this hotel as very central
633,unknowntraveller2017,2018-06-30,3.0,Ok The hotel is located in a good area of Bristol close to Bristol temple meads. The service is ok however the fact that it’s not a budget hotel I would expect a little more. The rooms are basic but nice again for the price you pay it’s a little dear. However the rooms are clean. Only book here if you can get it at a good price otherwise look elsewhere.
634,UKHotelLover33,2018-04-30,4.0,"Lovely hotel, excellent breakfast Stayed here on my own for one night and was given room 001 which made me feel quite important! The reason for 4 stars not 5, was the fact that my bedroom door was right next to the gym door with people coming and going, and also my room felt like it was in the car park! Went to the bar to get myself a drink to take back to the room and I was waiting five minutes before anyone came, there was a man who had waited longer, but the positives....

Huge tv, very comfy bed, good solid iron, not a rubbish travel one! Good shower, plenty of towels and shampoo etc, very pleasant staff on reception and breakfast, excellent breakfast, lots of choice. If I was staying again I would ask for a room on a higher floor just to feel a bit safer as a woman staying on my own. There was also a fridge selling soup/pasties crisps etc and a microwave facility in the corridor."
635,toni-lou1991,2018-05-31,5.0,Coach stop off Me and family stayed here as part of a coach trip. The hotel rooms are bright and clean. The bed is the best bed I've ever slept in. Tea and coffee facilities in the room and toiletries in the bathroom are a nice touch. Freeview TV and complimentary wi-fi are also great. Lots of cupboard and storage space in the rooms. We had the breakfast in the morning which was great. Loads to choose from .... Even a waffle maker!!! All food was cooked beautifully and of a good standard. Staff were all pleasent across the hotel. Very central location and walking distance to pubs etc . Lovely stay.. .... would like to take the bed back home with me please !!
636,FrenchPerson,2018-05-31,3.0,"Ok Stayed on a business trip. The hotel is well located. I like the local area. It’s a very short walk to temple meads station. Cross over the road and past some offices and you’re there in around 5mins. In the other direction you can cut across the church yard and there’s a Tesco express, subway and Pret A Manger, about a 3min walk away. 

Check in was easy enough. When I called reception from my room I was told breakfast finished at 9:30am, but they still looked to be serving at 9:45 so unsure. 

I was in Room 317 which was mostly fine. Unfortunately there were a few snags with the room and it wasn’t as clean as it could be. Attached pictures as an example. There was tea on the headboard that someone had spilled. Lots of grime around the shower. It could do with a deep clean and an upgrade. 

Breakfast was fine and the staff were friendly. The selection was standard buffet. 

The hotel was ok and was a standard Hilton. It would be fine if you wanted a good location. I would try somewhere different when in Bristol again though."

Also if you leave during your stay there is no guarantee you will get a car parking space again. Hotel is modern, clean and well located. Check in was friendly and easy. Lovely bar with great food. Breakfast is gorgeous and really good value. Bedrooms are very well designed. Every space is well planned out and storage is clever and useful. Beds are super comfy and rooms are very sound proof. We were on a floor with 2 hen parties and we didnt hear a thing! Self controlled heating in room which is excellent. Lovely powerful shower wth plenty of hot water. 10 min walk to Cabot Circus shopping centre. 15 mins walk to most tourist points. Airport bus is a 2 minute walk away and super handy. I would without a doubt stay here again."
640,Italian_kilt,2018-05-31,4.0,"Very good breakfast, quiet room We had a room on the 2nd floor facing the main road, luckily we didn't hear any street noise nor other noise from guests in the hotel, so we had a very good sleep.
Our room and bathroom were a bit small but there was a super king bed which we prefer, the bed was very comfortable. Our room was clean.
Location is very good, a 5min walk to Temple Meads station.
Breakfast was included in our rate and it was very good. Full spread of yoghurt, cereals, meat, cheeses, cooked items (full English - yum!) with an egg station where you could order eggs how you like. We find this an important requirement when staying in hotels.
Staff were helpful and polite.
Would definitely stay here again."
641,patriciatowns1976,2018-04-30,4.0,City break Very good place for city break. Yummy breakfast. Helpful staff. Close to most touristy things. Very happy to have parking but not always guaranteed. Roadworks were a bit of a pain whist driving there.
642,HelenS1993,2018-05-31,3.0,"Average - not amazing, not awful!  The room was clean and tidy if a little small (the bed must have been a double but felt very small).
Parking was extortionate (£15/day plus £16/night) so we parked at Cabot Circus (£2 overnight) and walked back (8 minutes walk). We’ve stayed in a few hotels in Bristol and never paid so much for parking. 
For the price (around £200 for two nights without breakfast) I didn’t think it was great value but there were no issues, check in and check out was quick and easy."

Bed was comfy with white cotton sheets.

It is 5-10 mins walk into city centre but it's great for the station, we were going by train so it was good from there.  In fact there is a back way out the station onto Brunel way then across the roads that is really quick.

Would happily stay there again if we were in Bristol.  Didn't eat here."

We stayed for a night in February, the weather was foul when we arrived - but the staff on reception were very welcoming and helpful, advised us where we could park and where we could get a meal (though it does have a restaurant) and where the popular pubs were (if we wanted to watch the 6 Nations Rugby). The twin room was on the 3rd floor, it was clean, well maintained and had all we needed...I slept soundly and didn't hear any noise internally or from outside (but we were out till about 01.00)...shower was brilliant in the morning...and the buffet breakfast was excellent - even though it was very busy we were shown to a table straight away and had a very nice full English, tea, fruit juice and toast. We were attending a music event at The Fleece which is only a few minutes walk away and this hotel is ideal if you are visiting from outside the city. I will definitely use it again."

Check-in had us shuffled around a bit, same floor but a couple rooms apart this was to ensure we were allowed in our rooms on time. This was fine with our party, not an issue.

Hotel was modern and in a decent location for us. Rooms were modern and in good condition. Breakfast in the morning was fantastic, really good food and good options. Drinks in the bar also weren't hugely overpriced. Very satisfied and would definitely return."

652,CBrown1992,2018-04-30,3.0,"Nice city center location! Stayed here two nights on a Trafalgar tour of Cornwall & Devon. Located on a quiet side street but walking distance to some sights and restaurants - even to the old town area of Bristol if you are a walker, otherwise a very short cab ride away. Included full breakfast was very decent and hotel staff courteous and helpful. Coming from Canada, we found the rooms (bed & Bath) a bit smaller than north american norms and the mattresses a bit too soft for our liking, but that seems to be the norm here based on our other stops. Since we were out touring each day, having a quiet place to sleep was paramount and it fit the bill."

The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spotless and very nice. I made use of the ironing board which was very handy and the air con made the night more pleasant as it was warm over the weekend. Staff were nice and helpful. The bar and outdoor lounge area provide for a lovely area to relax in the evening and a nice spot for a coffee in the morning.

658,ShirleyR212,2018-04-30,3.0,"Not quite as expected As I had booked a queen accessible room I was expecting one similar to previous stays in Hilton hotels.  When we checked in the receptionist told me the room we had on the 1st floor was small, so she suggested one slightly larger on the 4th floor and took us to both to compare.  I could see her point, so accepted the 4th floor room.  I didn't even look into the bathroom until later when I discovered that it was not an accessible-type bathroom.  At this point it didn't seem worth the hassle of changing rooms.  I have since decided that this hotel probably doesn't have any accessible rooms, and that all rooms are probably quite small.  We did, however have a nice view of Temple Gardens.  The best thing this hotel has going for it is their staff.  All unfailingly friendly and eager to help.  The location is excellent, most things in walking distance, or a convenient bus stop is outside the hotel if that is needed.  Breakfast is the usual buffet-type, with do-it-yourself toaster, waffle iron and coffee/tea.  On the whole it was a pleasant stay, but I did miss that accessible room."

The bartender was not sure how to make an American martini, but was happy to follow directions.  All in all it was a great end to our England trip."

The room was  very clean and had everythin we needed... lovely shower too. We had breakfast There twice, lots of choice... from cereals to a cooked breakfast... the hotel is in a great location to all the bars etc... and the train station.  We had a great stay, we'd definitley stay here again x"
661,samg198,2018-04-30,5.0,"Fantastic facilities supported by a superb team Recently stayed for 3 nights following an operation in Bristol. We had a bright, spacious modern room with plenty of amenities, everything spotless. The best part of our stay was the excellent service from all the staff - especially reception. They couldn’t have done more for me and were so welcoming and friendly every day! There is no room service for breakfast but as I couldn’t make it out of bed they did everything possible to help my partner bring breakfast to me - and what a spread it was! Everything you could want and all tasty and hot. My partner had breakfast in the restaurant the other 2 days and the service was excellent. I can’t thank the team enough for their hospitality and for making a very uncomfortable few days for me as comfortable as possible !"

The food is good, dinner as well as brkfast. The hotel os in walking distance from bristol highlife. Friendly staff hood bed, clean, parking space availabe. So all good.
👍👍"
663,dogloverkate,2018-04-30,5.0,"If there was 6* it would get more! We liked the seamless check in ....literally seconds. The rooms were spotless and had everything you need. (If I was super picky I think you could add some biscuits for the early morning tea!) The rooms facing the Templemead Garden had the best view. Back of the hotel. We looked over the road but there was no traffic noise/partying people whatsoever. My only niggle is the flashing green light on the heating knob. Drove my daughter crazy. We've had similar problems in other top hotels with the exit/fire signs. They are bright neon and keep you awake. Not sure what anyone can do about this as fire exits etc have to be super safe. We had dinner at the hotel with a full bar. The greeter/restaurant manager was French and extremely proficient. We ate pangaeus fish which we hadn't tried before and was delicious. The cheese cake was excellent. Afterwards reception drew us a helpful map and we ventured out to the harbour side. Utterly charming and I bet it rocks on the W/E and during the summer. So pretty! To do this just head out the back entrance...straight through the park, past the church, turn right. (Tesco Express 2 mins!) then keep going. River/harbour is on your left. You can walk all the way around and then back over another bridge to the hotel. Walk off all that cheese cake! There's no problems for ladies walking alone at night. We felt entirely safe. The sheets were finest cotton and in the morning the breakfast rivalled Hotel du Vin. Fresh fruit salad, eggs any way, full English, healthy muesli, croissants....smoked mackerel....excellent coffee machine. Before we left we also helped ourselves to coffee to go....in take away cups. Another mention to the gym and the computers in reception and excellent Wifi. Also the wonderful staff who 100 % want to please you. The house keeping lady beamed at us and was so happy when we said what a lovely clean room we had. I would think this is a wonderful hotel for business people but also for tourists at the W/E. We will definitely be staying here again! I've never felt so welcome or so relaxed!"
664,sophiehales6,2018-04-30,4.0,Great Weekend Break Firstly the hotel is in a great location. Just a 10 minute walk from some of the best restaurants in Bristol. The parking is expensive at £16 per night but in this location it's worth it. The room is small but very pleasant it has a nice comfy double bed. The room however is very hot! We slept without covers because of this. My husband was pleased to find sky sports on the tv in our room. The staff were lovely and very welcoming too!
665,Klapp2,2018-04-30,3.0,"Small and Warm room but great location We stayed for 2 nights for a wedding in central Bristol on Good Friday. On arrival we managed to get a space in the very small car park, it's £16 per night which I personally think is a bit extortionate. The staff were lovely and friendly on check in and made everything really easy. The hotel in central and really close to a Tesco / Pub / Subway etc so I wouldn't recommend buying food at the hotel because it's expensive for what it is. The room was clean and tidy. The bed was comfortable, but the room was so hot, even with the weather being cold and raining outside. We were on the road side of the hotel and it was quiet but not a very nice view. Can't fault the breakfast though, lots of choice from the buffet and easy to order anything particular you wanted. Again really lovely staff serving and the check out was painless."
666,gemmaa886,2018-04-30,4.0,"Perfect location, very warm room and extremely hard bed!  We arrived on the Saturday of Easter weekend at about 3.30pm after a busy day shopping and travelling up from Plymouth. On arrival the car park was full but we were told we could leave our cars on the cross hatchings down the side of the hotel. Our room wasn’t ready so were given a complimentary drink in the bar. Once we got to the room it was clean and tidy, if a little small side. We did however have a lovely view of the Temple Garden. The room was incredibly warm and the air conditioning was very noisy. Very problematic at night when the window only opens a small amount. The bed was also rock solid. I love a firm mattress, but this was even too firm for me. 

The location was perfect for us, in the evening we took the short 15 minute walk to the centre of Bristol. Ideal if you were going by train as it’s a stone throw away from the station. 

Beware if you do drive as there is roadworks on the major route to the hotel and a diversion in place. There is also a £17 charge for parking overnight. 

Breakfast was plentiful, tasty and varied for individual tastes.  Check out was quick and easy the following morning. Staff all very pleasant.  Also considering the hotel was full I heard nothing throughout the night from other guests."
667,Martinalvis,2018-04-30,4.0,"Can’t complain  One night stop over including dinner in the restaurant. Small room but perfectly formed with shower. I was on the 4th floor. It was very warm and the air conditioning was slightly noisy. Love fresh air but window only opened a crack. 
Very polite and pleasant staff who were also very efficient.  
I ate in the restaurant and ordered the steak that was rather pricy at £21 for an 8oz sirloin. Unfortunately my rare was cooked to medium so I sent it back to which a new one was returned cooked to perfection. Joined by a friend the meal came to a pricy £85 but it was convenient. 
Be warned parking £16 a day where as the Hilton double tree 500 or so yards away has free parking. 
In summary, says what it is on the tin and delivers a restful stay without the frills. Good location for centre activities."
668,85atifm,2018-03-31,4.0,"Brilliant location Hilton Garden Inn was only a two minute walk from the Train Station and a 5 minute walk from the central shopping areas. The staff were very friendly and professional. 

Our bedroom was promised to have a good view but instead we were looking into an old fashioned office block. The room itself was cozy and clean and it had very good housekeeping and room service. 

The facilities is a Gym and a safe car park. If you are going to attractions then the number 8 bus is directly outside the Hotel and takes you to Bristol Zoo.

However eating Halal or vegetarian food the choice of breakfast was a bit suffering and boring with no vegetarian sausages or choices and that is the only real let down. And because of the room fan it continues to blow stale air around the room, you can turn it off but at night during none-hot weather you simply get too cold as not enough is provided to stay warm.

I have seen much better Hotels and I have seen much worse. The only reason I didn't rate this Hotel at average is because of its superb location."
669,ClerVE,2018-03-31,5.0,"Afternoon at the Hilton Visited the Hilton Garden Inn where my & I  was served by Tilla, the food was delicious and Tilla was so polite & helpful, it was a  pleasure to be served by him.

671,chills1234,2018-03-31,4.0,Very Pleasant Staff My daughter and I stayed at this property for 1 night. We chose the hotel based on location convenience. I cannot commend the staff enough.

672,mikebP4522BL,2018-03-31,1.0,"Admin fail Due to snowey weather in Yorkshire where I live I had to cancel my hotel reservation on the morning that I was due to travel. Despite me being a Hilton Honors member the hotel told me they have no choice but to charge me a cancellation fee. I accepted that and then asked if they can email me a copy of the invoice, which they agreed to do but then didn’t. I contacted Hilton Honors who asked them again but still no invoice sent. I’ve also called the hotel twice in the last few days but have not got through the automated system. Think I will find a different hotel next time I’m in Bristol."
673,rachelkinney2018,2018-03-31,4.0,Lovley Hotel and great location This was a great place to stay in Bristol.  The service was quite good and the rooms were clean and comfortable.  There is a bar/restaurant on site which served decent food and there are loads of other establishments within walking distance.  The hotel is next to a little park with a church ruins that was nice to go explore while there.  Short walk to the train station.  Overall great place to stay.  Would also be great with a family.  Definitely recommend this hotel.
674,Lisah4,2018-03-31,5.0,"Stayed over Cheltenham festival  Stayed at the hotel as we where attending the gold cup at Cheltenham. We stayed two nights.This hotel is a short walk to the train station which was great for us. 

Arrived at the hotel and greeted by the lovely reception staff very friendly and helpful. We had checked in online before hand which made the process quicker. 

We stayed on the 4th floor over looking the main road. The rooms where quite and has very little noise from outside. Our room was spacious.  We booked a queen room but was a little upset due to the beds been two individual beds pushed together, this had a crease down the middle. The room was very warm and was difficult to keep at a cooler temperature. 

We had breakfast here both days which was great. Good selection of food and very attentive waiting staff. Breakfast was busy both days but no issues for the hotel. We used the bar which again staff very attentive and friendly. The bar prices are also very reasonable and no different to the town centre.

We had a great stay at the hotel and will be looking at booking the hotel next year for Cheltenham.  

There is car parking at the hotel at £16 a night."
675,I2705YAlisab,2018-03-31,5.0,"Great for business travellers Great spot for the business traveler - good location, friendly staff and great breakfast. Would recommend for short business trips - have stayed twice now and both times it has been consistently good."
676,oli_10000,2018-03-31,4.0,"Good, but small room. Pretty good location - great for the train station, airport bus and Cabot Circus. If you are after a central location for seeing Bristol then one of the hotels on, or closer to, the Docks would be a nicer location.

The room and bathroom were pretty good but very small. Breakfast was very good."
677,MillyH_13,2018-03-31,4.0,"Stop off in Bristol  We were on our way to bath for the weekend and decided to stop off in Bristol for one night, we obviously planned and booked ahead.
The hotel is near some huge construction which is fine noise wise but it makes the hotel a tadge confusing to get to when you arrive in the centre.
The receptionist was friendly, the hotel was clean overall, the room was small but well equipped, “park view” definitely isn’t what it seems, do not be fooled into paying extra for a room because of this. Parking is expensive but if you’ve driven into bristol you have no other choice, parking is not in abundance locally. We didn’t book breakfast, but the restaurant looked nice and it smelled lovely."
678,Devontiger,2018-03-31,4.0,Great value for money Spent a coupe of nights here. We needed somewhere for a weekend as we where on a course nearby. The hotel is modern and clean . The price was great. There are roadworks in the area and hotel entrance is tricky to find. The hotel is pricey at £16. There is as public car park next door where it is free from 6pm to 8pm
679,ruedelamour,2018-03-31,4.0,"Beware major construction locally & expensive parking Really difficult to find the way into this hotel due to major road works (tram system construction) detours needed with roads blocked or one way, best advice is to head for Novotel and go through their arch towards parking and you then find The Hilton. You would think the hotel would have alerted guests to this! 
small bathrooms with showers also at £16 per night the parking is overpriced. 
Only one of the lifts were working during our 2 day stay!"
680,404wendye,2018-03-31,4.0,"Groupon for tea is a solid value. Purchased a Groupon for the afternoon tea service at this hotel and it was clean, warm and reasonable.  The service for the tea was good, even though we arrived an hour before scheduled.  They also called a cab for us as it was raining when we left."
681,R1979SGjohng,2018-03-31,3.0,"Acceptable This was the first time of staying at a Garden Inn, previously we always stayed at Double Tree and Double Tree is far superior. The garden Inn was fine in that the room was clean, the shower room was very small. We had requested a double bed but got too singles, I requested a change but was told that none were available."
682,Edward_Lawton,2018-03-31,4.0,"Good  This is the budget range of the Hilton empire o believe it’s a franchise,anyway nice clean city centre hotel room was a good size and very airy.
Breakfast was well presented and all fresh and tasty,I would have no problem in recommending this hotel.
My only gripe is how can they charge you £16 to park overnight when you are a guest at the hotel bit like robbery really."
683,T_Hotel_Inspectors,2017-12-31,4.0,"a very good value option for room only 5- 7 minutes walk from the train station - very convenient for Victoria St and also in walking distance to Cabot Circus and City Centre - very comfortable hotel, room spacious and good shower. Was allocated a room close to the lift but asked if I could move and this request was easily accommodated. 
Although there was a Christmas event taking place, I was able to order food from the bar and was given the choice of taking the food up to my room or to eat in the bar"
684,MisterPesto,2018-03-31,4.0,"Lunch at the Hilton This is a place that you forget how nice and airy the setting / restaurant is, the Hilton is inviting.  The bar is appealing and beckons you for that pre-lunch or pre-dinner drink.  Tables are spaced nicely apart so that you do not feel that you are sat on top of the people next to you or that they are listening in to your conversation.  The staff are friendly and attentive, with food being served in a very reasonable timeframe for a lunch.  The food was good and well-presented.  I just need to remember to go here more often as it is easy to forget."

687,969suziea,2018-03-31,4.0,"A great little stay We booked in to stay before our flight the next day, (which unfortunately got cancelled due to the Beast from the East)! Approaching the hotel, you have to do a little loop - go past the building (on your left), then there are signs for you to turn left, straight on, right and then left to go around the back of the building and into the car park. The car park is £15 pounds and you need a ticket if you want to exit and re-enter. The hotel itself is very clean, well-maintained and the staff were welcoming and professional. As gold Hilton members, we could choose from either a free breakfast or a boost of points which was lovely. Breakfast was very good - lots of choices, from a full English to fruit, waffles, and cereal. The room itself was on the fourth floor; compact but with everything you need, including a little fridge. Even though the bed was quite new, it made lots of noise whilst getting into it. Apart from that, it was a lovely hotel."
688,GaryHodgson,2018-02-28,4.0,"Very nice short stay Very well positioned for shopping at Cabot Circus, our initial problem was the Satnav not recognizing the post code of the hotel - BS16BF, due to the extensive remodeling of the road system in the area. We ended up outside a Witherspoon’s, rang the hotel and was told to put ‘Temple Rose Street’ into the Satnav, which took us to the rear of the hotel.
Parking is £16 for 24 hours, which isn’t extortionate for city centre secure parking.
We were in room 430, with a queen sized double bed. The tea/coffee making facilities weren’t exactly generous, and the bathroom toiletries weren’t the greatest I’ve ever seen. The bed was comfortable and the room itself was quiet throughout the night.
We used the fitness centre the next morning (24 hour access with your room key) which was basic but adequate.
The highlight of the stay was the breakfast which was excellent. Huge range of food catering for all styles of breakfast and polite efficient service.
The front of house staff were cheery and helpful and I would definitely stay again if in the area."
689,65985,2018-02-28,5.0,"Amazing hotel I like this hotel because it is close to the city center and main shopping area.
The only downside is that the car park is tiny and it got to the point where some cars were blocking other cars in. You also have to pay £16 per day for parking which I feel is a bit high considering you are paying to stay in the hotel anyway and it is the hotels own car park.
Room was lovely and clean and staff were really friendly."
690,stevewZ8259KB,2018-02-28,4.0,"Nothing to complain about The staff are friendly, the food is good and it's generally clean and functional. Can't say there are any bad points (maybe just that the water pressure is a bit low in the shower), but equally it's not outstanding. It does a good job of giving you a good night's sleep away from home."
691,moliza1,2018-02-28,5.0,"Weekend stay Very comfortable weekend stay at this hotel whilst attending a family wedding.  Room very comfortable and very quiet, we were on the 4th floor.  The choice at breakfast was excellent.  All staff were very polite and helpful.  Parked on the road nearby for the first night which saved us £16.  Well worth doing as on road parking is literally just off site and free from 6ish to 8am."
692,kazzacon,2018-02-28,3.0,"Disappointed I'm going to begin my review with the bad points... At this point in time, this hotel is a complete nightmare to find. Nearly every surrounding street is either closed or have extensive roadworks going on, and although I except that this isn't the hotels fault, a simple email explaining this and a small map detailing how to find the hotel would have been helpful!! Upon eventual arrival, we parked in the fairly small carpark. Only to discover that the hotel charges £16 per night to park. Personally we felt that this was too expensive! We feel that the hotel should offer ""free parking"" as an incentive to stay here as opposed to arguably better nearby hotels with no parking facilities?? I would also like to point out, that when we received our final bill, the hotel had tried to charge us twice for the carparking! Check your final invoices carefully!! The rooms are average/ acceptable. Furniture looks like it's from IKEA and had definitely seen better days, same for the carpet. Bathroom small but functionable. Mattress was too hard, I had a terrible sleep here. The breakfast service is a nightmare. Bizarre layout. Not enough room. Very long queues. No plates/ bowls available and finally given a very hot bowl for my cold fruit salad! Felt rushed as our plates were removed the minute we finished our food. Now for the good points. We had a lovely view overlooking the park behind the hotel. 5th floor. It was also quiet. The reception staff were lovely and friendly. The same for the bar/ evening restaurant staff. It's fairly central, ten minute walk into town. I forgot to mention, I have never ever stayed in a 4* hotel, and not had biscuits on the tea tray, until now. Cheapskate...."
693,haz3064,2018-02-28,5.0,Last minute booking We initially booked a different hotel but it was dirty and the staff rude so we left and booked this. The hotel is wonderfully clean. In a superb location for Bristol Town centre. A pleasant walk into the town. Two nice pubs within a stones throw from the hotel. The hotel had a lovely comfy bed. Was quiet. Lovely and clean with tea making facilities. Everything you need for a night away.
694,Kailua031,2018-01-31,5.0,"Excellent staff and accommodations! This is a very nice hotel, with a central location. They have an excellent and very accommodating staff. The lounge and restaurant and very pleasing and the food is very good. Their room service is the fastest I have ever experienced. Lastly, it was so convenient to catch a taxi with the staff instantly ordering one for you."
695,marais75012,2018-01-31,4.0,"good value I usually stay at the Hilton Doubletree when in Bristol, but for a single night I wanted to do my company a favor and booked the Garden Inn, which had a somewhat lower room rate. The location is equally good, very close to Temple Meads and on the route of the Bristol Flyer Airport Bus. The rooms are smaller than at the Doubletree, but I did expect that, given the lower room rate. 
On my trips to the UK I always look forward to the full english breakfast, and I was not disappointed. I think I will try this hotel more often, in particular for shorter trips."
696,PadiP,2018-02-28,4.0,Central Great location. Nice staff. Good food both ends of the day. Parking extra but very secure and monitored. Handy to walk to lots of places to eat and drink and ten minutes from the mainline station. Enjoy.

701,N3996UUgreg,2018-01-31,5.0,"An excellent city centre hotel for a weekend break Let's be clear - this isn't a 5 star ""destination"" hotel. You won't be coming here for the pool [they don't have one], international cabaret [ditto], or unique bedrooms crammed with antique furniture [guess what?]. But, having said that...
This hotel is an excellent 4 star establishment, and is extremely well run by a management team and staff who seem to care a great deal about customer satisfaction.
Every member of staff made eye contact and said hello - even when passing in the corridor. That's a really good sign.
The house keeping was outstanding. Our room was perfectly prepared, spotless and very comfortable. It wasn't huge but I was in Bristol to see errr... Bristol, not spend hours in a hotel bedroom.
Breakfast offered a wide range of choices and was excellently presented and prepared. I enjoyed it hugely.
If I ever return to the city for another weekend break , I'll come back to the Hilton Garden Inn. I highly recommend it."
702,338iann,2018-01-31,3.0,"Comfortable Stay Stayed for 3 nights. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the railway station and is close to some really nice pubs and restaurants.

Staff are great, rooms are clean and the beds comfortable. Bathrooms are small and functional. What isn't so good is that the showers water on occasion stops and a colleague complained that the shower in their room was occasionally cold. I found the heating barely acceptable with the need to have the thermostat permanently set to maximum, the setting left by the previous occupant.

Breakfast has a really good selection, but again was not very hot on all 3 mornings. We did complain and the waiter did report our complaint to the kitchen, even checking with us the following morning. It was a little better but still not hot. Even the porridge was only warm. We did not eat in the hotel in the evening partly because of our breakfast experience and partly because of the TripAdvisor rating for the restaurant.

I would have forgiven the issues with the room and given a much higher rating if only the breakfast had been sorted."

704,PrestonGuild,2018-01-31,4.0,"A good value Hilton brand Because of roadworks it is tricky at the moment to get to the hotel car park by car, it is even tricky to walk to it.

Check in at the Hilton Garden Inn was swift, my status was recognised and I was given two bottles of water.

We got a room with a partial view of the park. The room is of a fair size, the bathroom had a standalone shower  and Peter Thomas Roth toiletries.

The compact room had a flat screen tv on the wall, tea and coffee making facilities, a safe, even an ironing board and iron.

Parking at the hotel has extra charges, if you want to exit just go to the reception and ask for slip which the barrier reads when you leave the car park.

We had breakfast included with our room. I thought it was rather good gnerally, we had made to order omelettes, croissants, we could make our own waffles.

I did think the juices tasted cheap and despite having a fancy coffee machine the coffee etc was rather bad being watery.

However this was a good value hotel with the Hilton brand. We walked it to the city centre from the hotel."

Breakfast not included so for what we paid it could of been better. We ate in the hotel restaurant. It was freezing half the group had their jackets on, said it to mamager he just shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Food was as good as what you would get in wetherspoons across the road, curry was watery but I was starving so I ate it. Plates cleared and no offer of drinks or desserts. Half an hour later when we asked he said to order in next 5 minutes the kitchen was closed. Just got the feeling are table of 6 in an empty restaurant was a hassle for him. 

Check out fine 

Directions given by staff awful.i don't know the area have a standard line on how to get the bus to airport. 3 different staff gave 3 different directions to my group on how to get there yes it may be 2 sides of   a square but just have a set line that will stop the doubt.

Will I be back no there are far better hotels in Bristol, nearer to the bars /restaurants /shops"

727,joelh875,2017-11-30,3.0,"It was all seemingly great. We chose the Hilton Garden Inn as it is part of a reputable brand and with this reputation you expect what you pay for.  

The majority of our trip was fantstic and based on the service of the team, the cleanliness, the hotel amenities and he location this hotel would get a thumbs up.  
The room itself was nothing special, just your standard hotel room. This is what we expected so again no issue at all. 

Unfortunately we were let down by the main event, sleeping! The mattress was well used and was a little difficult to get comfortable due to the dips and the pillows were a huge disappointment.  After the first night I changed my pillows and thought I’d give it another go. These pillows were equally as poor. As this was our last night in the hotel we had no need to request a mattress an pillow change we just went home more tired than what we arrived.   

I’m not sure if we were unlucky and got the worst mattress and pillows in the hotel, but based on my trip I wouldn’t be returning to this hotel in a hurry. 
The main purpose of a hotel is a comfy bed to sleep in and for almost £270 for two nights this should be an absolute given."

Only downside to the room is that the bed was hard and uncomfortable and didn't come with a fridge. I found that the staff were very helpful. I forgot my phone charger and the hotel were more than willing to lend me one overnight free of charge. An uber to the city center cost £4-£6 which is very well priced.However, the  car park price is extortionate considering the hotel wasn't extremely cheap."

736,Pen65,2017-11-30,4.0,"Very clean and decent sized rooms I stayed here as part of a reduced package found on Trivago, so made it affordable. Nice clean rooms and modern. We had read about the expensive parking, so we parked close by and it only cost us £4 for the weekend, so do your homework. Our deal didn't have breakfast either as again I thought the cost rather high, so went off to find our own.

Air con was rather noisy so glad it was November and cold, so didn't need it, but would have struggled to sleep with the level of noise it makes.

Lots of noise from corridor too at times, so sound proofing could be better addressed - I carry ear plugs at all times so I managed to get a good night's sleep. The reception desk area is a little echoey, and the desk staff soft spoken, so those suffering from hard of hearing made it a bit difficult. Less white noise and more curtains needed!"

The bed was really really comfortable, I wished I could spend more time in it! 
The bathroom was quite small but with a good step in shower and nice toiletries. 
I was able to park in the hotel’s car park which was an extra £12 for the night."

The staff (both restaurant and in the hotel in general) were incredibly polite and helpful. I ordered a salad which was fresh, properly dressed and very tasty. The pitas and hummus were also a generous size and a good starter. It was perfect for a quick business one night stay. The gym also has a good and versatile range of equipment. The room was nice and only let down by stained carpets and curtains. Despite overlooking the main road in the city centre, it was very quite and I had a good nights sleep. I will stay here again."

Special thanks must indeed go to the lovely Aimee who prepared a menu to savour and Juan who runs a very professional team.  I can honestly whole-heartedly recommend this venue for any family gathering or party.  I promise you, if you do chose to eat there you will not be disappointed.

Room is decent (although odd chair and sharp edged glass top desk can make finishing off some work in there after hours less than ideal).

Breakfast OK (mediocre in all areas but it's a cheap hotel buffet breakfast so that's average) 

Staff both friendly and helpful (this isn't as standard as you might assume)

Food in the restaurant is decent and the home made scotch egg was good. Avoid the burger but basically everything else is pretty good.

Cocktails OK (decent on expenses but not so much on your own money). 

WIFI good speed (which was nice)

Checkin/check out has always been painless.

764,7ET18M,2017-10-31,3.0,"Clean, functional hotel, parking woefully inadequate and poorly managed... The hotel is modern, spotlessly clean and functional.  The rooms have pretty much everything you would need and, despite being on the small side, work pretty well.  Breakfast is much as you would expect with a standard buffet-style layout.

The parking rather lets this hotel down.  The car park is small and clearly no attempt has been made to provide parking for everyone who is likely to need it.  That would be a little irritating but it is fair to say that there are other car parks nearby and I guess it is not uncommon for a city centre hotel.  

What is far more annoying is how inconsiderate some hotel users seem to be.  The car park has clearly marked spaces along one side of the narrow car park.  However, numerous drivers took it upon themselves to park opposite these spaces making it extremely tricky for cars parked in the genuine spaces to actually get out of their space.  I am disappointed that the hotel seemed to ignore the behaviour of these drivers leaving the car park to be something of a free for all. 

It's a shame because the hotel was fine - maybe they could consider a better way to deal with drivers who think it is OK for them to park where they choose rather than in the clearly marked spaces?"

775,nicklK1544VW,2017-09-30,4.0,"A pleasant stay, if a little hot I stayed in this hotel for one night with my lover. The location is very good, a short walk from the main train station and the main shopping centre. Very good location indeed. We arrived and were greeted by the smiling faces of the friendly reception staff. Good start. We got our room key and went up to the room, which was the 'King Suite' - which turned out to be two beds pushed together to form a big bed. The hotel advert describes this as a 'King size bed' but it isn't. This became apparent when my lover and I were in the middle of enjoying some hotel rumpy pumpy and I found myself sliding down between the two adjoining mattresses. A slight irritation, but fortunately my performance did not suffer. 

The hotel room was clean, but by golly gosh it was VERY hot. We had the air con on at the coolest setting, but that did not make much of a difference to the sweltering heat. The fact the window only opens 2 inches (I assume to deter would-be suicidal types and/or rock n rollers who want to hurl furniture into the car park below) did not make life any easier. It was incredibly warm and slightly uncomfortable. That said, I can't fault the cleanliness of the hotel room. The main public areas of the hotel was also very clean, apart from one instance. By the lift there was a tray with used plates, glasses, cutlery and the remains of what looked like another guests' breakfast left on the floor. This was there upon our arrival at 3pm, and still there when we returned from a day of gallivanting in Bristol centre at 11pm. Aside from that however it was an ideal little stay. 

All in all I'd recommend the hotel to anyone wanting a hotel with a good location, and who isn't too anal about the little things like abandoned food trays in the corridors.

777,N3535WYsamf,2017-09-30,5.0,"Friendly Staff, Relaxed Atmosphere in a clean modern environment. Having stayed here on numerous work trips to Bristol, I see this hotel and their staff as the highlight of my trips here. The hotel has a modern feel and the reception staff are always helpful.

Each day the rooms are immaculately cleaned and the food in the restaurant is possibly the best I've eaten in Bristol. They like to mix the menu up with their weekly specials so check them out.

The restaurant staff are especially helpful. They are always welcoming when I arrive back from a hard day at work. They take they time to get to know their guests and a special shout out to Sean/Shaun and Maria, who always go that extra mile to make sure everything is great. Seriously ask Maria to make you a cocktail ;) 

Literally the best Hotel in Bristol and having stayed in the other Hiltons in the city this is easily the most relaxed, friendly and clean. 

Its a short walk to all areas of the city centre and very easy access to the motorways and Temple Meads if you work outside the centre.

Also I work in IT, high speed free wifi = bliss!!"

There aren't many extras or surprises - no spa, no swimming pool etc - but all the essentials for a comfortable stay it gets right. I'd stay again.

The location is very good if you need to be in central Bristol.  It is a short walk from Temple Meads Station, and a short stroll to the very attractive waterfront area with it's numerous restaurants and bars.  It is a very new and modern looking hotel, and someone had the sense to provide some outside space to sit adjacent to the restaurant on sunny days.
The service provided by Annie at check in was exceptional, and all the other staff we encountered during our stay there were very friendly, efficient and helpful.  The hotel had clearly trained it's staff very, very well.
The bedroom was small but had all the necessary features.  The standard rooms had welcome touches like a mini fridge and a window that actually opens.  Though the mattress felt a little hard it was still very comfortable.
The breakfast buffet was excellent, the warm bread loaves that were provided were particularly exceptional.  A good selection of fresh fruit, fresh pastries, good quality hot items and a cooked to order egg station added to the overall ambience.  A 2nd coffee machine would be good to avoid the queues.

The staff at check in were very helpful, they even helped us get a drunken friend back to his room when he was too drunk to speak let alone find his keycard!

They have a gym that's open 24 hours a day and a bar with good service.

Assuming the hotels were much the same we weren't expecting much. The hotel is in a great location, just a 15 minute walk from the old city and harbour. The reception area was light and spacious and the restaurant located just off it. We headed to our room on the 4th floor, a reasonable size and well furnished with a nice en suite. The room was absolutely spotless. Always nice to have Aircon, and we needed it on the night we stayed as it had been a warm day. We slept well in the comfortable bed. In the morning we headed down for breakfast, which was a buffet affair. It really was excellent, one of the best buffet breakfasts I've had; to my delight there were large slices of black pudding under one of the heavy cloches! The waiting staff were pleasant and attentive. An enjoyable stay in a very good hotel."

We had a friendly welcome from Peter on the desk when we arrived and he gave us a map of Bristol and directions on the quickest way into the old city. Our room was at the back of the hotel which was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. Although the room was small it had all that we needed. The buffet breakfast was good with a lot to choose from and excellent coffee. The hotel was a short walk from the station and close to all the attractions of Bristol city.

812,BRLondon1001,2017-08-31,3.0,"Central, functional Typical of the Hilton Garden Inn brand so a central hotel, easy to find with comfortable room.  Good shower.
However I did have to complain to the front desk when I left that the tiny amount of toiletries provided in a twin room was rather mean.  One tiny 'bottle' of shower gel which was barely enough for one person for one shower never mind for two people.  One tiny 'bottle' of conditioner (but no shampoo) and two tiny 'bottles' of body conditioner (who even uses those!).  No bar of soap by the basin when washing your hands.  
Also, I heard this strange clicking noise during the night which I thought was perhaps the heating/air con but in the morning I noticed the kettle was boiling hot and completely empty of water.  I think it must have been switched on and the safety feature was, thankfully, turning it off repeatedly."

815,PoppyP71,2017-08-31,4.0,"Clean and functional This is a great hotel for cleanliness, location and a place to sleep but possibly not one of those where an evening in, in the restaurant/bar would be appealing. It's aimed somewhere between business and tourist, and it does it very well. 
The staff I encountered during my stay were all lovely.
The room was a good size and well equipped with a large wardrobe, an iron and board, tea and coffee facilities and a modern flat screen TV (a good sized TV!). The bed was a little hard for my liking, but that's just a personal thing.
Location is great for walking to tourist attractions; it's very close to Temple Meads train station too, so avoid the traffic and take the train.
Only downside (there's always one) - if you take your car and you use the hotel car park, prepare to be removing sticky tree sap from it. The trees are unavoidable and your car will be covered, and I mean completely covered, in this awful goo.
But, despite the goo, I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short break or a business stay."

This hotel is close to Temple Meads station (and hence close to the centre of Bristol). The rooms are fine, breakfast tasty, internet perfectly adequate (even for streaming movies). Three things that aren't on the website, that might be helpful to know: (1) The rooms have a fridge in them that's a fridge rather than a minibar (good for storing fresh milk). (2) there is a reasonably priced guest laundry on the third floor (£1.20 for a wash, £0.20 for 12 minute dryer. It only takes the old £1 coin. Correct as of August 2017).

824,HilaryP749,2017-08-31,2.0,"Too Much Hassle We chose this hotel because of its close proximity to Bristol Temple Meads railway station.  After check in we went to the restaurant for a light lunch.  Although we were the only people eating at the time service was slow.  My Caesar salad was very ordinary.  I usually have Parmesan cheese in a Caesar salad but I did not detect any in this salad which was just about acceptable.  When we went to pay there was no one around to receive payment and that was another unnecessary wait.

We were there for two nights. After the first night I straightened the bed and put my night dress under my pillow.  When I went to put it on in the evening it had disappeared.  It turned up in the laundry room!  It had been removed by the housekeeping staff.

On the final morning when I got the bill there were many entries for alcohol that I had not ordered.  The offending items were removed but I would have hoped that there were procedures in place to prevent that happening.

The good news is that the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable.

I might possibly stay there again because the hotel is in a good location and was clean and comfortable.  If I did stay I would pay cash for my accommodation and not leave credit card details.  I would avoid the restaurant.

The rooms although clean are small and cramped.  People who are on the large side might not feel comfortable here.

When I booked the room I was asked if there were any special requests.  I requested a room with a bath.  It was only after I was given my room key that I was told that none of the rooms had a bath.  I dislike showers and had to put up with the situation.  The shower was hot and efficient.  The shower cubicle was of a reasonable size but the rest of the shower room was cramped.  If you would describe yourself as of large stature this shower room may not suit your purpose."
825,steveturner76,2017-07-31,3.0,"Nice Modern Hotel - Terrible Food Service in Restuarant **Avoid Eating There** We went to Bristol for my wife's birthday while the harbour festival 2017 was on. We found the hotel at the last minute. Its a lovely modern hotel - close to the train station, shops and harbour, and all within a 10 minutes walk, so was perfect for us.

On my wife's birthday after shopping and meeting up with friends we decided to have a meal in the hotel restaurant because its looked modern and nice.
The restaurant is called reese's and to all future guests/diners i'd ** ""avoid at all cost""**. The food is alright don't get me wrong, but it took 2 hours to order and eat steak & chips, and some cocktails in a empty restaurant.
First of all my wife's is Celiac, but the menu in the room said it can cater for her. The clearly untrained waitress didn't know what Celiac was, let alone a whiskey sours. But she said the manager had a tablet that shows alleges to order from. While waiting 30 minutes for the tablet from the manager (which he never brought over), i got a whiskey not a whiskey sour. Learn to listen and take a drinks order.
Finally the shifty manager turned up to take our order (with no tablet) and clearly wasn't listening as i ordered the lamb and got the steak. We remembered him from earlier as the man who barged through us as we entered the restaurant. We should of know then this was going to be a bad experience. 
10 minutes before our food arrived (1hr 20 minutes after sitting down), the food finally turned up. We had basically finishing our steak & chips, and were still waiting for the drinks to arrive when my wife had to get up and ask again for the drinks. Joke!!!
I wouldn't recommend this restaurant especially on a quiet fairly empty Saturday evening- slow service, untrained staff that don't pay attention and an unhelpful manager that can't lead his staff to serve his customers/guests.
like i said **avoid avoid avoid**"

Location:
Hilton Garden Inn Bristol hotel is located 15 minutes walk from the Bristol train station in a quiet business area. In addition, it is only 5 minutes from Temple Meads Station and 10-minutes train ride from Bath Spa. The shopping centre is located barely 5 min away so if you are planning a bit of retail therapy then look no further. 

Facilities:
Hilton Garden Inn Hotel has a 24-hours reception, baggage storage room, restaurant and a room service. Wi-Fi is available at no extra charge. The fitness center is open 24 hours a day. The Races reception serves a nice breakfast to start your day with. During the evening you can choose from a range of International and British dishes but I wasn’t impressed with their quality.
The hotel has 2 meeting rooms that can host a conference or private event for up to 60 guests and if you wish to make your stay extra special then you can request to stay in one of the rooms with a picturesque view of Temple Gardens.

Room:
We stayed in a Queen Guest Room had a nice, contemporary décor.
Our room had a mini-fridge, work desk and a chair. I addition, there was a large 32-inch LCD TV. The bed which was comfortable and easy to fell asleep in.
The bathroom was very small. Some basic toiletries were provided.

Overall:
Hilton Garden Inn Bristol hotel has simple yet comfortable facilities in addition to great location. I would recommend it to anyone who travels to Bristol on business or for pleasure."

Once sorted we were asked if we wanted tea first so we're brought hot water with our afternoon tea being brought out around 30 mins later. Had to query ours as we'd requested plain sandwiches with no butter. They took them away and returned a short while later with what we'd requested. We also had to request cream for our scones.

832,LesleyAM400,2017-07-31,5.0,"Pleasing short stay A clean, comfortable hotel very near Bristol Templemeads station and close to the  Harbourside. We enjoyed a short but very pleasant stay.  I would recommend this hotel for a visit to Bristol City centre."
833,Y469LYlauriem,2017-07-31,5.0,Awesome hotel with great amenities Great location near the rail station. Friendly and helpful staff. Really appreciated the guest laundry room. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. I would really recommend this hotel to family and friends.
834,hannahk44,2017-07-31,5.0,"Overnight stay Myself and 8 friends stayed here the weekend for my hen party. The staff were very welcoming and the facilities were clean and modern. We stayed on a floor with 2 other stag parties which I believe was well organised so that we didn't wake other residents. However, once you were in your room we didn't hear a peep from anyone else. Very quiet. Breakfast was brilliant! Fresh and tasty. Perfect for after a night out. Hotel is also great location with only a 10 min walk into the town. Only downfall was the car park was a little short of spaces and quite small. Also think £16 was a little steap for parking but was just glad to get the car parked up. However, I Will definitely be staying here again!"
835,RJP1601,2017-07-31,5.0,"Perfect location, great team Perfect location, in walking distance from the harbour and the city centre with the added bonus of on site parking.
The room was super clean (as was the rest of the hotel). We only ate breakfast but it was delicious, replenished regularly and with a great choice.
The team at the hotel are a credit to the brand, everyone we encountered were really friendly and professional."
836,helloimjim,2017-07-31,5.0,"Excellent. Excellent stay, very clean, very quiet. Staff offered upgrade from twin to double which was much appreciated! 

The quality of the furniture was excellent and it smelled clean. I was also impressed with the obligatory freebies in the bathroom!"
837,christinesW7076KS,2017-07-31,4.0,Small problem The hotel was accessible for where I needed to be situated in Bristol. It was very clean and the staff were friendly. The only problem I had was the provision of extra pillows. I was a bit put out by having to pay £16 for the privilege to park in their car park even though I had paid a good amount to stay there. Most hotels provide their parking free of charge.
838,sarabR6248WO,2017-07-31,4.0,"One night  Arrived at the hotel and managed to check in earlier which was perfect as we wanted to go walk around the city without our bags. The receptionist was lovely, asked why we were visiting, gave us a map and was friendly. 

The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Idea location being near the station. As the weather was so bad we decided to eat at the hotel that night, wasn't overly busy which makes sense as to why there was only 1 waitress, she did her best but trying to catch her attention to get another drink and more water was so frustrating, almost went to go back to the room for some. 

When we were leaving and went to check out we handed the keys and card back to a different receptionist and just waited, never asked how our stay was , she just said yeh it's done and that's it. Disappointing considering the first receptionist we spoke to was so friendly and bubbly. 

Overall it's a lovely hotel and the rooms are nice , ideal for one or two nights stay."

Reception staff very friendly and professional. Wish I'd stayed here the first time I went to Bristol."
851,jppknight,2017-07-31,1.0,"Party hotel....... Shame we weren't invited. Hotel is in a great location for the city and the train station. Maybe that's why the hen party on floor 1 booked it. Those girls were a lively bunch, partying and shouting at 5am.

Would have loved to join in, we weren't invited. Nor were the hotel staff and they didn't come and stop it....... weak hotel management I would say.

If that was a premier inn we would have had our money back without a question."
852,Q3750YCsueg,2017-07-31,5.0,"Excellent service We arrived here at 10am in the morning and parked in their car park, you need to register your car on arrival, we were very pleasantly surprised when we were told that our room was ready and that we could check in immediately.  The receptionist was very pleasant and provided us with a map and helped us locate the places we wanted to visit on it.  
The room was on the 5th floor and was clean and spacious and had lots of storage space, toiletries provided and everything else that helps make for a very comfortable stay.  There is no rush to vacate your room as check out is at 12 noon."
853,leslief479,2017-06-30,3.0,"Hilton garden review Have just stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Bristol overnight. The hotel was clean and tidy and the staff were very helpful. The room was quite small and the bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen. Our bed was hard and you could feel the springs.
The breakfast was good though the evening meal was very bland but to be fair we were on an organised coach trip
As it was only one night it was more than adequate."

Nice hotel with a convenient location. Not far from the station.

Nice rooms but could do with a bigger bathroom and maybe baths. Not everyone likes a shower.

Will definitely recommend to people"
855,Drjbow,2017-06-30,5.0,"Excellent hotel Although we only stayed for one night, we enjoyed this hotel very much.

I think that the important point to make is that the staff were very helpful and interested in making our stay comfortable. 

The room was clean and very comfy.

The lobby and bar were very lively but also spacious to allow comfort for all the guests.

Central location makes it perfect. Many thanks"

Warm welcome from the reception staff, arrived early afternoon but room was available, clean and adequate.  Had dinner, again staff most welcoming, service was good, and food fine.  Breakfast next morning was usual buffet style, but very good choice for all appetites.  Again staff very helpful.
Would have given it five stars but thought parking charge of £16 was quite steep."

All of the staff were helpful, and nothing was too much trouble to make your stay there so good.  Hotel is also a very short walk from the station."
862,IainEGraham,2017-06-30,5.0,"Great hotel, and much better than other Hilton branded property just a short walk away Stayed here for the first time, having had an issue with another hotel just round the corner. This place is well located for Temple Meads rail station which is why I was there. All staff were excellent and hit the prefect balance of professionalism, friendliness and helpfulness. Room service food was much better than many Giltons (in my recent experience this seems to be a current positive trait of Garden Inns). No complaints about this place whatsoever. I will stay there in future on every trip to Bristol and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others."
863,lakeflyer,2017-05-31,4.0,"Nice stay in Bristol I stayed here in May 2017 while on a solo trip through the U.K. I selected this hotel in part due to the location to the Temple Meads train station, though ironically, I didn't end up taking the train at all from Bristol.

Even before I arrived at the hotel, I had interaction with the staff and that good experience continued on-site. Although I was slightly early for check-in, I was greeted warmly and given my key. I had a double room on the side of the hotel that looks out towards the Temple Garden, which was nice and quiet. Entering the room, there was a small bath to the right. Moving further into the room, there was a small desk and office chair next to the window, a very firm queen bed, and a stand-alone wardrobe that contained the safe and clothes hanging space. The bed had decent pillows and the linen felt clean and refresh. While there was AC/heat, the window opened wide enough to provide fresh air; and so I never used the heating/cooling system. There were plenty of standard electrical outlets that were easy to reach both near the desk and at the bedsides.

The bathroom was small but since I was by myself, it was perfectly serviceable for one. (It might be tight for two with a lot of product). The shower was also a bit tight but once inside and the door closed, there was enough room to move around. The water pressure was good and the temperature control didn't drift too much. The towels were amazing, large and fluffy. The bath amenities were Peter Thomas Roth. 

The in-room wifi was relatively fast. I ate in the restaurant one night and was impressed with the friendly staff and decent food. To get to the city center, it was just a short walk (less than 5 minutes for me). There was also a Tesco Express nearby, along with a few pubs, cafes, and coffee shops. I walked around the area in the evening and never felt uncomfortable as a solo female. 

All in all, I was very pleased with my stay and definitely would recommend this hotel."
864,GailMaidstone,2017-06-30,5.0,"Lovely hotel This is a lovely hotel, very clean and modern.

866,mingfangl,2017-05-31,5.0,"Good to stay at Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre I have been using the Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre, previously in different names/brands, for the last over 15 years for business travel accommodations and found it is really a type of hotel I like, though I have also tried other hotels in the nearby areas. Many other of my colleagues choose the same hotel under my comments or suggestions, and they feel good as well. I hope the hotel continue to keep its superior services, and it will continue to be my best choice in the future."
867,inkwave17,2017-05-31,4.0,"Great value and convenient location We arrived by train and the hotel was just a short walk away through an office park, easy to find (use the Temple Quay exit from the station). We were really pleased with our room, which was on the small side but modern and very clean, clearly designed towards the business traveler. Would have liked to have a few coat hooks by the door though. Our room had a partial view to the park and this meant no road noise at night, which was a plus. The bathroom was compact but well-designed with a great shower and plenty of fluffy towels.
Friendly helpful front desk staff fixed some small issues for us and made time for questions.
The immediate area is quiet on weekends as it's mainly office buildings, but there are a couple of pubs and shops within a few minutes walk if you don't feel like wandering too far. You can also easily walk into Bristol center, or there are plenty of buses around the hotel. Bristol Flyer airport bus stop is conveniently around the corner as well.
Overall, a comfortable and reliable option with a good price tag."
868,jameshW7030AN,2017-05-31,5.0,"One night stay This hotel is conveniently located near the main railway station in Bristol.

The breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful."
869,beckyo419,2017-05-31,4.0,"Nice hotel and good location  Stayed here as we were travelling to the o2 academy for a concert. The hotel is well kept and spotless. Our double room was nice, basic but nonetheless suited us perfectly. The fridge in the room wasn't working however staff at the hotel ensured it was fixed promptly. The staff are very friendly, young lady called Patricia helped us with a map to direct us to where the nice bars and restaurants were. Bristol is lovely and I'd definitely return to this hotel again. The only drawback is that breakfast is rather pricey however I feel that this is down to the Hilton itself rather than the individual establishment."

871,WelshDisabled,2017-05-31,4.0,"Bailed out at Last minute. After the dreadful experience at the Doubletree Hilton the welcome that we had at the Hilton Garden Inn was a massive relief.

The staff could not have been more helpful, all of the people that I spoke to were friendly and would try to solve any issue.

The room that we were given had disabled access with wet room and was on the ground floor. The restaurant was also on the ground floor so access was not an issue at all.

The towels were soft and fluffy. The television was large and the tea and coffee facilities provided Twinings tea.

However, the room itself was tiny with a 4ft 6 bed. The bed itself was hard and the pillows equally so. Needless to say the two nights spent were not the best sleeps. The entrance to the room was just passed a fire door which opened the wrong way, in my opinion, so when I exited the room I then had to reverse to get into the corridor. The breakfast was okay but the continental selection was meagre.

At £125 a night for B&B I thought it was overpriced.  

Had there been a Premier Inn near to Temple Meads Railway Station I would have preferred to stay there!"
872,Wentworthkent,2017-05-31,5.0,"Perfectly placed to visit Bristol near Temple Meads Station We booked this hotel to be near Temple Meads Station ,not the easiest to find the car park.

Ideal base for visiting Bristol."

Within walking distance of Bristol Temple Meads train station and yet really quiet rooms. Very comfy bed, really clean room and lovely polite staff. The only reason for four stars rather than five is that there was no 24 hour room service (which there's been in every other Hilton I've stayed in) and we couldn't reserve a parking space - it was on a first come first served basis. But other than that - a great place to stay and I would go back again."
875,ickle_jay,2017-05-31,4.0,"Very nice hotel I stayed here for one night this week, as I had a meeting to attend the following day.

The hotel is very close to Bristol Temple Meads, less than a five minute walk.

Staff were pleasant and helpful and the room, although small, was clean and comfortable.  The only issue I had was that my air conditioning turned itself off after about 15 minutes but as it wasn't really hot outside that wasn't a huge issue.

The fitness room is small but nice, although it was very hot in there.

The restaurant is good, I had a lovely steak, and breakfast was a good and varied selection, and served from 06:00, which was a bonus.

All in all, a very good hotel and I would definitely stay again."

The staff were very courteous at reception and helpful.  The bar lady Beatrice was so nice to talk to it made my stay very pleasant.

879,PeachExplores,2017-05-31,5.0,"Excellent City Stay This hotel is well located within walking distance of the train station bars/restaurants and shopping areas, there is also convenient parking should you arrive early enough so grab a space.  

The hotel itself is very well presented and clean, staff are friendly and efficient.

We stayed in room 128, a queen with a park view... lovely room with everything you needed included an iron/ironing board, safe, fridge, hairdryer and ample storage.  The room was very clean and fresh although not particularly spacious which I expected in a city hotel, this was only highlighted by a huge chair which got in the way a few times and could not be moved easily.  

The bed was quite firm, for me not a problem but my friend struggled with her back although we both had a reasonable nights sleep, the air conditioning was left on overnight and we were able to sleep as it is a constant dim hum rather than some of the louder units.  In the morning we were horn pleasantly surprised that although we heard people chatting as they walked down the corridor we were not woken early with doors banging which can sometimes be the case.

We did not have breakfast the following morning however the selection looked good in the bright restaurant area."

Short distance from the shopping centre and 3 minutes away from Temple Meads Station and Temple Quay ferry stop. A short walk through the little park at the rear will take you to the super King Head pub and the equally excellent Olive Branch Italian restaurant. A very positive experience."

The staff were all very welcoming and polite, throughout the entirety of our stay. Always very efficient and quick to help, even allowing us to check-in a couple of hours early. The hotel itself was lovely and clean, as well as being bright and airy. The rooms were light and modern, and of a medium size, perfect for two. A selection on teas and coffee's were available in the room, as well as bathroom products.

We didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast which was lovely; the restaurant at breakfast was packed, and offered a lovely selection of breakfast foods, ranging from the classic full English, to pastries and waffles, to fresh fruits and cereals. I would definitely recommend adding breakfast to your stay, especially on the weekend as service doesn't finish until 11:00am, perfect for a lie-in or after a heavy night."

891,431suep,2017-05-31,4.0,"Clean, convenient and great staff Stayed here for one night and was very impressed with this hotel.  It was only a 5 min walk towards town from the station so easy to get to.  Although it is on a main road heading into town if you had a room at the back and used the rear entrance which leads out onto temple park then you would not realise where you were.  The rooms very great and very clean with everything you could want for your stay including hair dryer, safe, fridge, iron etc.  The only downside was that we only had a shower in the bathroom and not a bath but this really didn't matter to us.  You could even open a small side window to get some air which is unusual these days.  I have stayed in other hotels in the city centre before but would definitely stay here again."

We arrived before check in time and they kindly allowed us to leave our bags as we headed off into the city. When we checked in it was swift and effortless and off we went to our room.  

The room was clean and tidy, bathroom was compact but had what was needed. Good TV a and air con made the room nice and cool, well cold actually much to the disgust of my girlfriend !! So she turned it up. 

The reception called a taxi for us when we headed to the show and it appeared within a few minutes. 

We stayed on a dinner, bed and breakfast deal. When we went for evening meal it was early and we were very well looked after. The food was very nice, menu doesn't have lots to choose fm but what we had was top quality.  

Breakfast this morning ran till 11 so no need to be up to early. I have to say the selection was amazing, they even had a waffle machine. 

Over all our stay was really nice, god room, quality food and most importantly helpful, efficient and friendly staff. Top marks indeed."
893,Elaine01202,2017-03-31,4.0,"Staff who go 'that extra mile' Used this hotel whilst visiting Bristol with friends, found the location very convenient for us travelling by car and our friends arriving by train.  The reception staff were extremely helpful in ensuring that there was a parking space for us as we had to travel with some heavy medical equipment.  We had a garden view room, which was very nice and quiet.  We had dinner at the hotel our first night which was very good and most reasonable.  Breakfast each morning was excellent with very efficient staff keeping the tables cleared of used crockery & cutlery.  All the staff we met were fantastic and certainly went that 'extra mile'.  Will certainly return when next visiting Bristol."

Room was clean, spacious and really nice. We had aircon in our room too which nice. 

A 5 min walk into Bristol city centre. Parking on site is £16 which isn't too bad. We checked out in the morning and they happily let us leave our cars there whilst we went for food.

All in all, a great hotel with really helpful staff."

We had afternoon tea here and it was a horrible. 

Bread was stale and minimum filling. But worse if all the scones were store bought!! And they were grilled instead of coming out of the oven. The clotted cream had hardened and gone yellow all over. 
We had two slices of a soggy apple pie and a hard brownie.

We had a queen room overlooking the park (which is more a large grassed area with a path through it so don't expect rolling greenery). Bathroom was just a shower. Quite small but functional. Bed was very comfort. But room was really warm even with the air conditioning on. That's the only negative. Breakfast was lovely. Clean tidy hotel. Well worth the money. Was about five minute walk to the canal where the bars and restaurants start. So good location

Lots of choice for drinks- juices, coffee tea,  The room we had housed a KS bed. The bathroom was spotless.

The rooms were really clean and the decor was very nice, lovely big TV with lots of channels, kettle and tea/coffee & ironing board/iron.  The bathroom was also lovely, it had a shower though no bath which was fine with me!

Check in was efficient and friendly. We stayed in a room on the 4th floor overlooking Temple Gardens and it was well worth paying a supplement for the view.
The room was kept immaculately clean, was well equipped and the bed was extremely comfortable. We slept really well and were not disturbed by external noise at all. The shower was a good size and powerful with plenty of hot water.
We stayed on B&B rate and were impressed with the breakfasts, they were self service with a good choice of good quality cooked or cold items. 
We also ate at the City Cafe on two evenings and the food was reasonably priced and beautifully cooked, a real treat.

I don't know Bristol at all but was really pleased on my first stay to discover the hotel really is minutes walk away from Temple Meads, it's on the doorstep. The rooms for all 3 of my stays were tidy & had sufficient space, although one of the rooms had a peculiar smell, but you could live with it. The reception staff were always so friendly and the room service & restaurant staff really knew good customer service. The hotel is a good location for travellers & is a good distance to town for the shops. The rooms are clean and the food, top notch! Would stay again if i find myself in the area!

I am impressed with the rooms because they are very small but really cleverly designed to give one person all they need.

2. We were 7 friends for a night for a stag do weekend. Checkin was smooth, and hassle free. We were allowed to checkout by 1pm with no questions asked or any surcharge.
3. Rooms are small, neat and tidy. No issues. We were allocated 4 rooms, all on the 2nd floor near to each other (206, 211, 223 and 235).
4. Wi Fi is free.
5. Negative: Parking costs 16 gbp for a night, which is a tad too much.
6. Breakfast options as with Hiltons was great. Tasty food.
7. The cafe serves great coffee.

We loved the service, the staff. Bristol is a great destination for stag and hen dos, its a good party place. This hotel is an ideally located and comes at a good price."
913,TSL-Travel,2017-02-28,5.0,"Quality Valentines Weekend I took my girlfriend to Bristol for a weekend following Valentines Day to spend some time away together, we booked a king-size room which was clean and modern, the beds were comfortable and we slept great. The king-size bed was infact two wide single mattresses (as usual at large hotels) but the seam was not particularly noticable so this was okay but annoying when you pay extra for a ""king-size bed"".

The staff were helpful and the car parking was very reasonable in comparison to surrounding car parks, they are also flexible with car parking and day parking does not seem to cost money, only overnight which is great if you want to continue exploring after check-out.

As Bristol has so many great restaurants we did not eat at the hotel so I cannot comment here, I stay at many hotels and generally I find rooms to be small but this will always be the case with large purpose-built hotels such as this Hilton. 

My girlfriend was very happy with our Valentines trip so I can definitely recommend this hotel for a quiet weekend away with your partner, the room was also well set-up for business trips with a desk facing out of the window and a decent office chair. I will probably stay elsewhere if I visit again but this is just my preference as I am always curious as to what else is available.

Overall I was very pleased with our stay and the price was good considering it was such a busy weekend, my girlfriend was happy which was the main point for me as I work abroad a lot so hotel stays are not too special to me."

Rooms clean and adequately furnished for business or leisure use includes fridge.

We were conference delegates and returned to hotel to check in around 11pm. The night porter was very efficient and suggested we pre-paid for parking so that could post receipt under door to speed up checkout process as our company had booked and paid via Expedia. When issuing the room cards he expressly told us breakfast was included with our package even commenting it was unusual for breakfast to be included..... After a full on day my colleague and I took up the included breakfast, were welcomed room numbers taken and seated.To be honest due to building works it was not ideal the noise of drilling and sanding filled the air thank God we didn't have hangovers I thought. We had a few basics from the buffet as both had meetings, we noted other guests who hadn't got inclusive breakfast were told to go and pay at reception first. 

Imagine our surprise when the hotel decided to charge the credit cards we used to pay for parking an additional £13.95 after departure without saying a thing or contacting us. 

Despite calling several times and emailing hotel to dispute they ignore us so 1*.... Good customer service gets good reviews!

By the way your contact email address on website is incorrect according to your reception team!"

Where this hotel scores is the people it recruits. From Annie on reception to Tilla at breakfast, every effort is made to make you feel not just welcome but completely at home. Nothing is too much trouble, from ' take a seat I'll bring your bacon over' to ' it is a bit chilly, would you like an extra heater in your room?'

The lady who checked us is was polite and very helpful. 
We did not have breakfast as there was little chance we'd get up in time but if the photos are anything to go by, it does look really good so shame I was so lazy/hungover :)
The room itself was pretty cool, lots of storage, comfortable, good TV despite lacking channels. The bathroom and shower are epic - the sort of shower that hurts it's that powerful, ohhh yeeeaaahhhh! :)
I unfortunately had to rate this establishment 4/5 because the parking cost is shocking - £16.00 per night and I'm a Yorkshire lass so naturally I almost swallowed my wallet so I didn't have to pay it.. I suppose you'll pay it because it's convenient but I cannot say I was happy to pay that - even Birmingham NEC don't charge that much. 
However, I will certainly return if in the area and if I'm at a gig. Maybe swallow my pride instead of my wallet and just pay the parking without my inner monologue shouting at me to be reasonable. :)
I recommend to all!"

946,bluenoseam,2017-02-28,5.0,"Great weekend hotel! Stayed here for a weekend in Bristol.  It was a cracking location virtually on top of Temple Meads station and as a result is perfect for both rail connections & air connections as the airport bus stops there.

Room was well sized & inviting with all the usual amenities you'd expect to find bright and comfortable, plenty of space for two adults I'd say and more than ample for one!  Only slight complaint would be that the air con is hit or miss with no discernible difference between 1 & 3 - in context it was like a vacuum cleaner in the next room so while not LOUD it would still be enough to disturb light sleepers!

The bathroom was small but functional, very bright & well stocked with toiletries for those perhaps forgetting something.

The staff were top notch respecting the guests & not being overbearing, informative of offers (breakfast upgrade) but without seeming robotic or forced!

If you're looking for a place to stay 5 minutes away from connections in & out of Bristol you're laughing, at only 10 minutes walk away from the City Centre it's spot on.  The local area is convenient with numerous shops & places to eat located around as well should the need arise."

948,flyman2009,2017-02-28,3.0,"Average room, average breakfast, good location I stayed here as I was going to the theatre with my partner and I chose this hotel as it was close to the train station so I could get to work easily the next day.  Digital check in was a really good idea as I could choose the room I wanted before I arrived rather than having one allocated to me.  Even though I checked in digitally, the actual check in experience was quite slow as for some reason they had not taken payment so this had to be done at that time.  The room was quite small and the bathroom tiny. The bed was also quite hard although I did sleep reasonably well. I was woken up at about 5am with deliveries arriving at the hotel. I had a park view so I dread to think what the noise would be like on the road view.  The room did have everything you needed such as an iron and ironing board, empty fridge and tea and coffee facilities.  I stayed on a bed and breakfast rate and I have to say that the breakfast was a bit disappointing. Cold porridge and only butter for toast. When my partner asked for sunflower spread instead we were told that they only had butter. It was all, well, a bit basic.

950,K999INjanl,2017-02-28,4.0,"Garden Inn I am very satisfied. I have stayed there for 2 weeks and it was a good time. It was a nice place, but the air condition is not so efficient, but overall experience is good. I strongly recommend that hotel. However, what is lacking there are fresh vegetables - tomatoes are cold and tasteless, there is no carrot and on the other hand there is no mozarella cheese. Breakfast is too heavy, so British :)"

Would recommend trying them. Will definitely stay here again."

Towards the end of my stay here I was actually hunting for a reason to knock a bubble off the five-bubble review I was writing in my head. A speck of dirt, a less-than friendly staff member, a weak shower... anything. I couldn't find a single thing wrong with this hotel. We checked in online, and that let us pick a room, which was amazing. Our welcome was incredibly friendly. The room was amazing, with innovations to make our stay more comfortable (the pivoting mirror is genius). We used the gym, which was very decent for the hotel size - dumbbells up to 20kg, a cable machine, and a few cardio machines. A pleasant check out and the hotel is perfectly situated between the station and the town centre. We paid £44 for a room for the night, and we would absolutely stay here again for the right price."

The standard of accommodation, the Inn's location in the city a few minutes walk from Temple Meads Railway Station and the service provided were all excellent. The staff were very friendly, professional and lovely to talk to. The breakfast in the morning was top quality: lots of choices, quality food items and a relaxing setting. We had a fabulous view of Temple Gardens from our fourth floor room. Overall, as a Hilton Honors Member the break represented excellent value. I appreciated the digital check-in facility, so easy to use and it saved on time at reception. We look forward to returning to the Inn in the near future."

Breakfast was way above average.

The room is comfortable and lots of space power sockets and storage in the bed area. The bathroom has been well designed to take advantage of the little space granted it.

Breakfast is a good choice of English and continental.  You sometimes have to look for things. The jams are above line of sight and the drinks hide around a corner.

The one down was looking at the scrambled egg and discovering something in it. It looked like meat so being a veggie I was put off the whole idea off cook breakfast."

At almost £200 b&b it wasn't good value, and a Premier Inn would have provided a better room and breakfast for less money.

The windows in the room were absolutely filthy, which makes me wonder how clean other items were!

Breakfast was ok, although chaotic plus it was tricky to find a clean table to sit at

Absolutely faultless and for £70 peak season (Xmas) you couldn't ask for more. 

Only minor criticism is the wait to be checked in was about 15 minutes as the night porter was the only one behind the desk. The receptionist and finance assistant were doing things behind the counter but avoiding eye contact with us in the queue so they didn't have to check us in. That's a bit poor"

The rooms are comfortable. the negatives for us were ... car parking is too expensive so we didn't use it. The carpets in our room were quite stained, which made them look dirty although I wouldn't say the room was dirty. The breakfast was good and tasty but would prefer it to be hotter, the cooked food was lukewarm. All the Cafe staff were also exceptional, on Sunday it was very busy and they went out of their way to ensure we were seated and comfortable... A special mention goes to Aga who gave us a great impression of Hilton. She was exceptionally friendly, positive, cheerful  and helpful.    ."

Basically the reception must has a list for check in or check out guest each day but I don't know what's going on this hotel. At 9am housekeeping knocked my door really loud and open my door room?? I woke up with my colleague and walk to the door and see what happens. I FORGOT to take ""do not disturb"" out the door (but it's that necessary to do that?) then I took it out and unbelievable thing happened. A second loud knocked my door again??!! I dialled to reception to ask what's happening to your housekeeping. NOBODY!! SAY BLOODY SORRY!! To me just said ""oh ok!! I talk to them !!!???? What is that?? After that still keep closed (bang) another  room's door next to our room often and bloody loud!! 11:50am I checked out and talk to Reception Manager. You know what? Even to be sincere to apologise  to guest who paid £120 that night I haven't got it for them just easy sorry.😠 so if you wanna pay for expensive and high quality you expected just go somewhere else NOT HERE!!

We requested the rooms to be together and they were. The staff very friendly and helpful. The rooms were lively. Nice and clean. The shower was real nice and powerful. The only thing with the room was it was a little dark with all the lights on and no light over the mirror. The car park is very small and didn't see a car park near the hotel. Do not sure where we would have parked. The car park is also not included in the price it's an additional £16 for 24 hours.

Really small car park though, they do have the use of one up the road.

1007,HardyHuckle,2016-11-30,1.0,"Shoddy bathroom and shower, poor service and not following up on promises made. I stayed for one night. It was my first time in Bristol. I figured that, if I paid the extra asked by this hotel, I would have a better than average night, as the cost was more than double the usual hotels I stay in for business. 
1. I was told when I booked on the booking line that parking would be £12.00. When I arrived, I was told it was £16.00.
2. The bathroom was very cheaply fitted out. Plasticky fittings which were coming away from the wall in places and no power shower. The shower was a flimsy affair that hung off the wall and had to be screwed into position in order to be able at the right angle for me to stand underneath it. Then the water just trickled out of it and it took me approximately 45 minutes to wash the soap off me. 
3. The bed was solid as a rock. No comfort and no sleep. 
4. The room was small and the coffee making facilities were barely adequate.
5. At breakfast (I arrived at 8am, so was not even remotely late) the croissant basket was empty. I asked if there were any more, as I was having a continental breakfast and already had the cold meat and cheese. The woman in charge told me in abrupt manner that there weren't any more and I could have a pain au chocolate instead. I told her that it would not mix to have a sweet pastry with ham and cheese. She just shrugged dismissively. She exhibited no customer skills at all. I feel that, in a city the size of Bristol, they could have an arrangement with their baker and have the ability to fetch more croissants if they run out so early.

Anyway, the upshot of it was, I complained about these issues on their email address. The very next day I was sent an email of apology and an assurance that they would pay back the full price of my accommodation. They even stated the amount they were going to pay and that it would be at my address in 5 to 7 days. I sent an email accepting this offer. 
A few days later I received another email asking me to send them a copy of my statement showing how much I had paid. I answered, telling them I could not get to a scanner for a while in order to comply with this request. Now they are telling me that unless I do this, there will be no refund. Needless to say, I am appalled by this double cross."
1008,42kennyc,2015-12-31,3.0,"One of the closest hotel to the train station Great stay in a convenient location. The room was clean and the bar served really nice snacks which was handy for when we got peckish at night. 
The only downside was that we were put in a disabled access room on the ground floor, which had no bathtub and a wet room, with the entire design of the room laid out for someone with a disability. This wasn't made apparent to us when we booked, and when we asked if we could change rooms to one with a bathtub, we were told there weren't any bathtub in all the rooms and refused. This is the first time I have ever asked to change room in my life.
Overall, we were happy with the cleanliness and the bar, but the helpfulness of the staff and the mix up with the room really put a damper on our stay."

1013,oldbutkeen,2016-11-30,5.0,"Great staff, excellent hotel/brand in its class For the price, you won't beat this hotel. Charming, friendly and efficient staff - all really well trained and motivated. Spacious, well designed rooms. Surprisingly large. Firm but very comfortable beds. Nice little bar and an excellent breakfast that would shame many more expensive brands. Getting your eggs cooked to order is an excellent touch and the best scrambled eggs I can recall in a buffet breakfast. Well done everyone."
1014,998glent,2016-11-30,3.0,"Nice location  I have stayed here before.  The hotel is quite nice, modern and clean.  Parking can be a pain at times but I got a space every day last week. A short walk out the back of the hotel takes you straight to city centre. The hotel has a small but functional gym which I also liked.  

My only complaint was the quality and price of evening meals.  Not a massive menu, which is ok, but the price for portion size seems unfair.  Anything with vegetables seemed to get the smallest portion of vegetables I ever seen. Additionally I over heard restaurant manager telling a potential xmas booking she didn't know how to book xmas dinners, and bluntly told the person on the phone we have turkey, when obviously asked what was in the menu.  Some restaurant portion control or revised pricing, and a customer relations course for evening staff and this would be a lovely hotel.  I would still stay again but probably eat out."
1015,crumpet93,2016-11-30,5.0,"I would stay again. I have just checked out after spending 5 nights at the Hilton. I can safely say, I will stay again. 
I arrived to friendly staff on reception, who greeted me with a smile and waisted no time getting me checked in. 
The room was clean and nicely decorated, with tea and coffee making facilities. 

I didn't try dinner at the hotel, but the breakfast was amazing. Plenty of choice and just what you need to start your day. 

The room was always cleaned to a high standard and the cleaning staff always greeted me with friendly chatter when I passed in the corridor. 

Checkout was quick and simple and took a lot less time than I thought. Which meant I could get an earlier train than planned. 

I may be needing to come back to Bristol in the future and I know where I will be staying :)"

Thanks very much for another great trip"

1018,MarCarl819,2016-11-30,3.0,"Don't forget the parking charge £16 I will review the hotel later in this review but first you must know that if you wish to stay here, your car need to pay to stay also. Common in most cities but at £16 for up to 24hrs - it's ridicules!!!

There are alternatives, you can park down the road in a public car park and only pay until 6pm or park on the road around the corner. But if you want some security for your car - pay the £16. 
I paid only because I wasn't comfortable leaving my car exposed on the streets, but that's where they have you. 

The hotel might have the Hilton name but it's no Hilton hotel, more like a holiday inn express. Small rooms, very comfortable and good standard, extra small bathroom with shower only. 

The reception staff are friendly but shy away from comments about the parking charge. 

Room service has a £5 try charge, the prices are high as you expect from a Hilton. 

If you book with the hotel directly, you are supposed to get free wifi-which you do, but so does anyone in the hotel-do they think we're stupid. No benignity to book through Hilton Honours!!!

Small, expensive parking, clean and modern"

The room was lovely, spotlessly clean and had everything we needed, the bed was very comfy (so comfy that we overslept and didn't have time to try the breakfasts on offer) and the TV size and choice of channels was better than expected. The bathroom was small as other reviews have stated but was more than adequate for the two of us. Our room was the city view as opposed to the park but we had no problems with noise and didn't hear a thing despite building sites being close by. We were able to get a space in the car park where we left the car for the weekend as most places are within walking distance or a short cab ride away. We will definitely stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in the future and look forward to going back."

The final total of £634 was then taken from my bank, with them not cancelling the original £590 which left me with -£174 overdrawn, so my tip would be to have at least double your room cost in the bank so you don't get stung with bank charges and 4 days of no money like me..."

Shame about beds and the sleep. Rooms were average, nothing special."
1026,TorontoTraveller43,2016-10-31,4.0,"Nice and Central - Everything You Need Our foursome of two couples used this as an overnight stop en route from London to Cornwall travelling by train.  We booked standard Queen Bed, Parkview rooms and found these nicely appointed and very functional, both for our quick overnight stay and for longer stays.  The hotel is 5 minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads rail station (using the short cut route, 10 minutes otherwise) which was a prime reason for selecting it but also was a short walk to the ""floating harbour"" and other sights in Bristol.  We would definitely book this hotel again when we next visit Bristol.  

Particulars are as follows:

Location:  As noted, this hotel is well located for those travelling by train as we were doing.  It was not hard to find and is mid-sized.  It has a nice view of a park (Temple Gardens, I think) which houses the ruins of a former Knights Templar church, Temple Church.  The park is nice and quiet and enjoyable to walk through and see the substantial remaining ruins.  We found a large range of restaurants and fast food places nearby as well as ATMs.

General:  The hotel is quite modern and in good condition with a reasonably spacious breakfast/dining area and bar and a compact but serviceable front desk arrangement.  (Although the late afternoon sun hits desk staff in their eyes and hotel management could well consider adding some tinting to the windows on the park side of reception.)

Room and Amenities:  The room was not spacious but also not cramped.  In particular, it was well designed and kitted out, being sufficiently large to accommodate a couple of large suitcases.  It had a comfortable bed, a desk, two chairs and adequate storage.  The bathroom was fine, with shower only but it was a good shower.

Cleanliness:  No complaints on this front.

Breakfast:  Was included in our room rate and was much more extensive than we expected for a chain, particularly for the good price we paid for the rooms.  There was both cold and hot buffet options along with some opportunity to order freshly cooked eggs of select varieties.

Staff:  Staff were cheerful and helpful.  Our traveling companions had a problem with plumbing and were immediately moved with staff help to a nearby and better class of room.

Would we stay here again:  Absolutely with no hesitation."

1033,Jacquietolan64,2016-10-31,5.0,"Perfect  We travelled down from London Sat evening we arrived at 830pm and parked up just two spaces left at that time in the car park but we got one . Reception checked us in very quickly and no complications very professional in fact and very friendly . We had a double room on the 5th Floor the room was spotless and compact , we were there for a friends wedding so we needed a room we could also get dressed in this was perfect for that as it had a great shower , hairdryer , iron /board and great mirrors including a long mirror. The view over the park was lovely and the window goes from
Floor to ceiling . The room was pretty spacious , the flatscreen tv was fab and the sheets white , clean and fresh . The only tiny thing I was not mad on was the bed it was a small double and a little bit hard however I slept blissfully and did not hear a sound all fri or sat night the hotel is secure and quite . I see some reviews say it's a bit noisy I never experienced s bit of noise . I ordered room service actually I popped down to collect and bring it up in a tray as I
Did not want to pay £4 charge for delivery of sandwich . The menu does anything from chips to sandwiches to steak . The sandwich was nice snd you get coleslaw and a few Crisps for £7. 

We did not do breakfast but I had a quick look and it was quite nice.

The car park we used it from fri at 830pm on arrival to Sunday it was £16 in total for us this was OK as we never moved the car all weekend to keep out spot ( if you move it you could lose it) if the hotel us really busy best to keep your spot , they did say if we lost it we'd only is for the day we used it and when you check out at 12 you can keep your place all day . Ideally it should be free parking but many hotels charge now. 

The hotel location is perfect right near the city , we booked an amazing Itallian meal at a close restaurant 10 min walk away it was the best and the town is safe I felt comfortable walking about. 

Make sure when booking you chose this Hylton as there is another close to it but it does not look as impressive do choose Hilton garden city centre . The bar closes when the last guest leaves so another good thing . 

Would I stay again most definitely and I'm fussy so this was a great choice for us ."
1034,TristanK568,2016-10-31,4.0,"Pleasantly surprised I was attending a course held at the Garden Inn Bristol so stayed there also for convenience. I didn't have huge expectations of a mid-range branded hotel, but to be honest I couldn't legitimately complain about very much at all. Check in was quick, friendly & efficient. The room was spacious & quite well appointed, the bed comfortable. There was a real shower rather than standing in a bath. I feel that hotels are generally terrible at breakfast, once they have your money from the room rate it becomes a cost reduction exercise. A this hotel however, they seem to make an effort, the buffet was fresh & constantly attended, eggs were cooked to order and there was also a waffle station for a hot alternative to the standard full English."

I'm usually a bad sleeper but had the best nights sleep in ages.  Food was really nice, especially the breakfast.

Very quick check-in and helpful friendly staff.

We booked through GB Tours and for the price we paid we didn't expect to get such a nice hotel.  Didn't get to see any of Bristol though as it was only a stopover.

Would definitely recommend"
1037,Fianchetto,2016-10-31,4.0,"A good hotel near Bristol Temple Meads train station This Hilton hotel is part of the Hilton 'Garden Inn'  brand and is perhaps a little more basic than a standard Hilton.  It is located in the business district of Bristol. It is a short 10 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads train station (the main train station to London) and the hotel does have a small car park.  

For this visit I checked-in online (so I could select my own room) and my key was ready for me.  All the rooms on all the floors are of the same standard, and my room was absolutely spotlessly clean.  It had the usual facilities, but a little smaller than you might expect. The bathroom just had a shower and was particularly compact.

I had a quick meal at the bar - an omelette which was ok and came with either chips or salad.  Again it all feel a little basic, in most hotels omelettes would come with both.  The Merlot was perfectly drinkable.

The room was reasonably quiet, the bed comfortable and I got a decent nights sleep.

Breakfast was a hot and cold buffet with bespoke eggs if you wanted.  The food I had was good as was the coffee.

Check-out was quick and efficient.  The staff were all friendly.

Overall a good stay."
1038,Neenals,2016-10-31,3.0,"Good value for money hotel Parking is limited but there is another car park down the road you can pay to park in. The hotel car park I did find a little expensive at £16 a day, if you're a guest of the hotel paying over £120 a night this should be complimentary or charged at a much lower rate. Reception staff friendly and efficient. Rooms are small but comfortable, great for business travellers as spacious desk space and comfortable chair to work from. Beds comfortable but pillows a little to soft for me, woke up with a stiff neck. Showers powerful, again bathrooms very small but has everything you need. Iron and ironing boards in the room which for business travellers particularly is very useful. Big TV in room with plenty tea and coffee making facilities. Didn't use bar or restaurant so can't comment on these. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty, busy with lots of people running around but that's unavoidable. Internet was fantastic, you could even stream Netflix it was so good. 

My only real negative (apart from soft pillows and expensive parking) is the house keeping staff are very noisy so I'd be apprehensive to stay here for leisure if I was hoping for a lie-in. As I was on business I had to be up early anyway but this would really annoy me if I was hoping to sleep in."

The unhelpful Receptionist placed me on the first floor, the noisiest location possible. It's about a 15 min walk into the city centre. Rooms are small but clean and the bed was comfortable.

1040,lgrohr,2016-09-30,3.0,"Smallest Room of Any Hilton Brand Hotel I Have Stayed In First, it was difficult to get to this hotel with construction in the area. The parking lot is not large enough to handle all the cars, so people park anywhere which make it difficult to get your car out of a proper parking space. I couldn't believe the size of the room. This goes back to the London hotel room sizes of the 1970. As usually, Hilton seem to have a problem with hiring people who's first language is English.  Also. to get two face cloths in a Hilton brand hotel in England is a challenge.  Their breakfast is a buffet, but you can order the eggs the way you like.  I ordered an omelet and it took them 20 minutes to make it.  I will not being staying at this Hilton brand hotel in the future."

1042,garethcgriffiths,2016-09-30,1.0,"Hotel fine, staff rude Arrived at the hotel and managed to park the car in a very small and limited car park. Frankly I found the staff rude and preoccupied with things other than their guests. When I went to leave the hotel that evening nobody answered the intercom to let us out of the hotel meaning I had to go back to reception queue up and then be rudely dealt with again. The receptionist didn't even look at me or speak to me when I asked for her help, she simply passed me a car park token. 

The Bristol half marathon was being run the next day and on returning to the very small car park there were no car parking spaces. We parked on the street later to have my car towed away. I don't blame the hotel for that but if you have got a small car park acknowledge it and if there are local things going on then provide information to help aide your guests. That is what I expect from Hilton."

I did think it was going to be a little bit closer to the Center though but it is only a short walk away.
There wasn't many food places that near there was a Wetherspoon around the corner but other than that you would have to walk a distance or drive for something to eat.

1050,MaryKop,2016-08-31,3.0,"Convenient to train station We were only planning to spend a couple days in the Bristol area, with plans to see Stonehenge and Bath. The hotels in Bath were so expensive, this seemed like a reasonable alternative, since there was a regular schedule of trains to both  the Bath/Stonehenge areas and this was much cheaper.  I was not as impressed with this Hilton property as I thought I'd be, though it was clean and convenient. It was about 100 yards walk from the train station (exit out towards the wharf, cross the parking lot, take a diagonal through the plaza and it's across the street---there was a lot of construction when we were there, so there might be an easier route...). This property was kind of sparsely decorated--that Scandinavian look--but it was comfortable and friendly. 
Check in seemed a bit busy --but it turned out one of the clerks was on a break---which we found out when we went to our room and found the A/C was not working. Tried to call the front desk (no dialing instructions in the room--had to guess what to dial) and no one answered for 5 minutes. Finally gave up and went back downstairs to inquire---desk clerk said she couldn't check because she'd have to look in the back room and the other person was on break...leaving me standing in the lobby waiting to find out if I had to change rooms....eventually she was able to check and found out the A/C had been turned off in the room (!) and enabled it for our use.
She mightn't have bothered--we ran that unit at full speed/as cold as it gets for 2 days and it never dropped below 80 in there. I know we Americans generally are used to A/C and cooler rooms--but this was really uncomfortable.
The room was clean; the beds comfy; the bath  really nice and I loved the fridge in the room. Just wish it could have been more a more comfortable temperature for sleeping. 
Breakfast was not included, but if we chose the option at sign in, we could get access to the buffet for less than 10BP per day---after looking around near the hotel and finding very very few options, we chose to go with the buffet. Probably worth it since we could eat a big breakfast and skip lunch during the day.
All in all, not a bad hotel. Friendly staff, felt safe to walk around at night, and there are several pubs and cafes nearby (but we were there on banking holiday weekend and several things were closed for the holiday). Short walk to trains."

Very comfortable  bed, with good quality bed linen, soft fluffy large towels and good shower in a compact but functional bathroom. Iron and ironing board, safe, fridge and hairdryer in room. Some spare sockets which is a plus rather than having to unplug a light in order to plug in a hairdryer. Excellent meal in the restaurant with very good service. Stayed on the 4th floor, very quiet. A great stay."
1061,korky48,2016-09-30,1.0,"One night is enough We were on a bus tour of the area and had a one night stop at this hotel. Arriving 17:30 we were allocated rooms and despite the fact we were all in same party we were split up over the whole hotel, we were on the first floor as well as my brother and his wife.
My brother has a walking aid and when we arrived at the first floor it was Impossible for him to reach their room, why? At 6 pm the corridor was blocked with numerous trollies as rooms were still in the process of being made up!  At 6 pm in the evening!!! 
The hotel room was fine as expected for this type of Hotel,
As we were with a tour we had a set meal to start at 6:30pm, however, the meal left much to be desired. The ""school dinner line up"" was inefficient to say the least. My wife and I are well travelled not only in UK but worldwide.
To serve a pate with dry white or brown bread (NOT TOAST) was a first, the bread had obviously been open or hours as it as dry as a bone. The main course left many of our tour participants speechless, the large pork chops were so dry and cold they were curling up. The so called mix of vegetables in one serving dish were steamed and thrown together in a watery mess, these were cold as well, my wife and 2 other from our 6 person party had pasta again barely warm and this was at 6:30 pm at the start of the dining period. There was a fish dish; however, no one was taking this as they did not have a clue what it was!! No indication at all until I asked the staff.  The gravy was totally ruined, if a chef in an Hilton restaurant can't make gravy without massive big lumps of ""BISTO"" gravy mix then they should be in another job. The desserts were laughable cheap supermarket cheesecakes!! These had also been left out for hours as they disintegrated when you tried to put a piece on the plate all the other items were cheap supermarket cakes.

We realise there is a budget for this type of trip, however, if I can go to our local pub and have a 3 meat carvery with 5 types of vegetables etc, etc for £4.50 it puts a Holiday Inn restaurant to shame.

There were only 2 coffee sachets and 1 tea bag in the room with 2 small milks so have a cup on arrival but not in the morning seems to be the policy in this hotel.

The female ""manager of the bar area was very helpful and nice and friendly, again bar staff require training how to serve a pint, not so full with no head that it spills as soon as you pick it up!!
I have contacted the tour company as well as many others on the trip and they are aware of the number of dissatisfied travellers as they have already had numerous complaints.

The breakfast was the normal hotel type and was very nice."
1062,valj345,2016-09-30,3.0,"Oh dear not exactly 4 star We went to our  twin room on 2nd floor. It was very small, we couldn't sit both of us at the same time in the chairs. Bathroom small as well but the shower was great.Quite clean but my friend who I was sharing with who had worked for Hilton many years was appalled at the standard for a 4 star hotel.
Breakfast was adequate with usual fare.
As we had gone  as a coach party, dinner was provided. I have had better canteen dinners that what was served there. I understand that as a city hotel it caters more for business people, but if they cannot provide an adequate dinner service then they should not say they will do it.
All in all we will not be returning."
1063,Departure667405,2016-09-30,3.0,"Ok One of the few hotels in central Bristol that you can book for 1 night at the weekends plus guarantee a twin room - good when travelling with friends.

Fairly standard Hilton fair. Expect queues to check in at weekends - particularly 3-5pm.

1064,19Cam,2016-08-31,3.0,"Good location but small rooms There was quite a wait to check in and no priority for Hhonors members. The staff on reception were polite and helpful though.

The room itself was fine, though it was on the small side. Bed comfortable and good AC. The bathroom was absolutely minuscule and not at all practical. Just about manageable for a single traveller, totally unsuitable for a couple or family.

The breakfast was excellent (especially the waffles). Check out was a breeze. I would stay again if travelling alone on business in the area. Probably not for a leisure trip."

1067,DaisySalt,2016-08-31,4.0,"Excellent City Hotel - everything you need! Great small city hotel - been here a few times before.
We had a problem with the booking initialy when allocated a double room although we had booked a twin which was quickly and effectively sorted out by the excellent head receptionist.
Rooms are small but very well designed and well equipped - fridge, iron, kettle, small but perfect bathroom. Lovely quality linen and towels
Excellent breakfast - self service with quality ingredients and attentive pleasant staff on hand to help.
Parking on site with surcharge - this was quite expensive at over £16 per night
2 Gripes which stop me giving 5 stars - some nice biscuits on the hospitality tray would be nice...and at night it was SO hot in the room, I hate air-con buzzing away and it was impossible to open the window more than 2 inches."
1068,Shozzzz,2016-08-31,4.0,"Wonderful Clean Excellent Feeling Hotel itself is nice, clean & well decorated. No doubt in quality furniture, and all necessary items at this hotel. I was booked on 5th floor (Top Most), room facing Victoria Street. Bed was comfortable, Lamps were awesome, Big Screen LG TV.
From my room i had a great view of the evening night life of Bristol City Center.
Washroom was tidy.
Be aware ! Parking around this area is very tricky, with restrictions in place, ALSO the hotel offers a very expensive over night parking of £ 16, so ideal if you are at your own.
These days some constructions work is going around this area, so at times you need to travel a bit longer than planned sat nav route.
Staff was very friendly and helped me in every need.
Will definitely stay if i come to this area again."

However at weekends the hotel seems to draw too many people on parties, stag weekends etc. Woken at 0400 by a ridiculous argument in the hallway by a worse for the wear guest. Can't blame the hotel"

Very close to Bristol Temple Meads - easy walk with luggage. Very short wait to finish check in - actually I checked in online which was very easy and I got to select my room which was very cool - I've never seen that service before!  The room was small with a queen bed and tons of storage space and nice Herman Miller office chair.  Comfy bed with white sheets and duvet.  Nice shower (very small bathroom though, but fine for me)."
1076,433martynt,2016-08-31,3.0,"Fantastic breakfast buffet; but average hotel First impressions wasn't great, the hotel car park was small and cost a fortune (£16)

The staff where pleasant; but very busy and I was required to queue for greater than 10minutes to check in.

The room was well decorated, but the bed was very hard and uncomfortable! Room was clean.

Paid for a queen bed; but only got double.

Just another very generic hotel!"

1081,emmac0023,2016-05-31,3.0,"No tv, pizza poor, moved rooms Could have been a great stay, lovely looking hotel, rooms very comfortable. All I wanted from the evening was rooms service, tv and sleep.
The tv was not working and despite several calls to reception no one gave me an explanation as to why not an apology. I ordered a pizza which was served in a pizza box with salad on top - was thin and tasteless and sent back. I was asked to chose something else but declined. Eventually, at 10pm, I walked down to reception to ask about the tv, they told me there was only service in half the hotel so they moved me. Shame they couldn't have done that on my first call.
The tv worked fine and I was offered a nightcap as way of apology, which I accepted!
Aside from these issues the hotel is in a great location & breakfast was good.
Parking is paid for in the hotel, but they must give you a ticket to get out, which was forgotten when I left and I had to 're-park and return to reception! 
There is a Doubletree and Hampton nearby so in future I will opt for these first."

Would definitely stay here again."
1089,Richard_148,2016-08-31,4.0,"Lovely Hotel & Car Park Wars The Hotel itself is lovely & would happily stay there again. The interior is very pleasant, the rooms have user-adjustable air conditioning (very helpful in all seasons especially Summer!). The food quality was superb & the Breakfast Buffet is especially good value for paying just a small extra amount. I managed to get my room swapped after e-mailing the Hotel in advance so that I could stay next to other people I knew, which was very much appreciated. Unfortunately, I can't give my stay 5-stars as my departure was met with challenges - you pay for the parking in advance but there is no notification/obvious notification that Reception needs to issue you with a Barcode Receipt that needs scanning to open the exit barrier; this I only discovered when I tried to leave and, when pressing the Help button on the exit barrier was connected to a telephone line that was asking me to press buttons on my phone to reach different teams; this needs revising as it's not providing a service. There was a lady behind me in the queue who had a receipt & directed me back to Reception to get one, but she appeared to of been issued one which had expired (they're typically valid for 30 minutes) - so when I walked out with my valid ticket I gave mine to her and I walked back into Reception to then collect another exit ticket for myself. This part of the Hotel estate has been poorly setup and needs urgent revising; if it was Winter and/or Raining then this would lead to people's visit being completely tainted. Recommendation: Guests NEED to know the procedure & the Help Point at the exit gate needs to actually provide Help, not just connect you to an automated line that asks you to press buttons where this quite clearly can't be done"
1090,240fedora,2016-07-31,4.0,"Nice friendly hotel. Nice hotel in a very convenient location.  Good friendly staff and a good breakfast.
We were not driving and chose this hotel for its convenient location near the Temple Meads Station.

there are   major road works around the hotel  at the moment so it is  very noisy at the front.
If you are in Bristol for leisure do not forget to take the ferry which brings you to various locations in the city and is very near the Hotel."
1091,engineer-foodie,2016-08-31,4.0,Somewher to lay my head... I am curently in Bristol with work most Wednesday nights. I usually stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. Friendly reception staff. Rooms OK. Good location. Really good breakfast buffet. If you are driving think about using the public car park at the back of the hotel which is free between 6pm and 8am.
1092,devronmac,2016-08-31,4.0,Nice central hotel but beware...... parking in hotel car park very pricey indeed. We stayed in an Evolution Twin Room overlooking the park at the back of the hotel. This is probably the quieter side of the hotel as the front faces and is close to a busy road. We were not aware of the extensive roadworks around the hotel which actually made access tio the hotel a real challenge. In the end although we could see the hotel we couldn't actually see the way to the entrance. We had to park in a nearby street and walk to reception to get directions .We were also very annoyed that we found that we had to pay £16 minimum for overnight parking. Hotels.com whom we booked through failed to tell us about this expensive extra. These annoyances aside this proved to be a comfortable hotel centrally located with friendly staff and a decent breakfast
1093,rettt2016,2016-06-30,5.0,Two night stay My wife and I stayed here and day tripped to Bath. The hotel was very accommodating. The laundry room for guest use was nice to have. They gave us a special treat when we told them we were traveling for our honeymoon and gave us a bigger room. It's within walking distance to the train station which was also nice.
1094,chris_w_young,2016-07-31,3.0,"Satisfactory business hotel This hotel is clean and well maintained and the staff were friendly and helpful. The wifi was problematic but the management explained the problem and it was fixed within a few hours (apparently upgraded to a newer/better system).

The room was quite small and basic and was satisfactory for a short business stay, breakfast was the usual hotel buffet fare.

Overall not one of my favorite hotels but acceptable as an overnight or short stay on business."
1095,mhkay,2016-05-31,4.0,"Comfortable and Convenient In the city centre, wedged between a quiet park and a busy main street, the Hilton Garden Inn is a clean, comfy and modern oasis.  I have stayed here many times and the place never changes, it is consistently my ""go-to"" value hotel in the center of town.  There is a Bistro/Bar off the main lobby that is a good choice for nightcap drinks or snacks.  Not a wide menu, but adequate.  The rooms are small-ish, but very modern and clean, plentry of work space.  Every room has an Apple all-in-one TV/Computer, nice for a quick browse of the internet (not such a good TV choice, though).  The bathrooms are small but modern and ultra-clean.  The carpark can be a bit of a challenge to get in and out, very cramped with little room to maneuver."

We booked this hotel as a stopover hoping to get a good nights sleep before our forwarding journey the next day, however the good nights sleep didn't happen as we were woken up at 03:45 by people talking loudly or arguing in the park opposite our room,we tried to get back to sleep but it was impossible.on checking out at 05:30 we complained at reception about the noise waking us up and asked if we could have a refund for the breakfast we wouldn't be having, so he suggested that he wouldn't charge us the £16 car park fee,its a shame because the room was lovely,staff were very helpful
so i suggest if you use this hotel ask for a room that doesn't face the park."

As soon as I arrived, the receptionist who looked like a supervisor or manager had a disgusting attitude. Never said hello both times I seen her and actually gave me dirty looks. 

It is great they speak many languages, as she was Hungarian and so is my partner. So they spoke in Hungarian which is fine. But she never once greeted me in Hungarian or English. She also did not give me any information and I had no clue when breakfast was or for how long.

However the rest of the staff were sublime. The morning staff and breakfast staff were so helpful and friendly and the breakfast was fantastic.

The room was standard and it was cold"

I did forget toothpaste and called reception for some and they said they didn't have any, which I think is a basic for a hotel to have in case needed so was a little disappointed. I had also requested early check in, and then when I arrived at 11.50am was told no rooms were available which was again disappointing but overall a good stay in a clean room"

The breakfast was good too.  Our room was at the back of the hotel and was very quiet, although it must be said that the front of the hotel was very close to an extremely busy road so it must be assumed that these rooms will be noisy.

1108,AnneFMcG,2016-07-31,4.0,"Decent stay I booked this hotel online and it was only when I arrived that I realised it was the old City Inn, which also had a previous name that escapes me. I had stayed there many times some years ago now.

Check in took far too long, with only one receptionist available. She was busy dealing with a man complaining about the lack of WiFi in his room, the iron burning his shirt and numerous other things, leaving the queue to grow longer by the minute. This was particularly annoying as I was in a hurry to get to an event. 

Other than that relatively minor issue, I have no complaints: the room was fine, I enjoyed a decent breakfast and found the staff to be pleasant and professional during my stay. 

I'd use this hotel again if it wasn't quite so expensive."

Booking in time was 14.00 however we turned up with big bags at 13.00 and tried to check in which wasnt a problem. Approaching the hotel we saw about a mile of road works directly next to it - the receptionist upgraded our room to a park view (could have been due to road works).

I was given a pass key, went up to the second folly let myself into the room only to find it had someone else's valuables and belongings inside. Thank god there was no one there having an intimate moment. Back down to reception feeling embarrassed and angry I was offered an apology and two free drinks vouchers. And another room key on the fourth floor. I don't even feel like leaving my room now I'm case done one else gets given a pass key and steals my belongings. How can this possibly happen? In 30 years of travelling this is a first. So unprofessional. Dint know why to say."

Great service and we would recommend it highly."

Dinner menu was poor, no halal options available. The room was small, the king size bed was actually 2 single beds joined together, the bathroom was tiny, I could touch the door and the sink with my hand whike sitting on the toilet seat. There are no snacks provided in the fridge, and also what annoyed me, they provide everything to make tea or coffee but no water. I would not recommend this hotel"

1122,P4P814,2016-07-31,4.0,Good reception team Booked a one night stay here for myself and my boyfriend on a flying visit from Ireland. Price was very reasonable considering it happened to be the same weekend as the harbour festival. Upon check in a lovely lady named Charley told me that the car park was full but that they were recommending parking across the road in a public car park which was free until 8am. This for us was the best choice anyway as we were getting up early. The hotel car park is £16 which I wouldn't want to pay anyway given the option. Room was clean and basic. My one issue would be the shower. After a long day I just wanted a hot shower but couldn't for the life of me figure out the temperature gauge. It had no arrow to tell you which way was up and to me was just to frustrating. When left to my boyfriend he figured it out with a bit of patience as it was taking a very long time for the water temperature to change. All in all would stay again
1123,olivial631,2016-07-31,5.0,"Clean, friendly & like home! The staff were really friendly and helpful, the room was really clean and had home-like amenities including a proper iron and proper hairdryer! There was a stand up shower rather than one over a bath which I liked but may be a bit annoying if someone was over for leisure and wanted a bath. Its great that there was parking right outside the hotel but worth knowing there's a car park behind the hotel that's free after 6pm as the parking in the hotel is really expensive and got full quickly. Also at the moment I couldn't get to the hotel off the main road (the way the sat nav took me) so had to go round the back - no fault of the hotels of course but worth knowing for the moment!"

1130,V1451WWemmal,2016-07-31,2.0,"Problematic Parking & Basic Hotel ********** 

I've stayed at this hotel numerous times for work and each time, it just continues to frustrate me and have notified our travel team to seriously consider removing them from our preferred supplier list. 

1.) Car Park - Stop letting non hotel guests park in the carpark. And prohibit parking on the white lines - why have restrictive lines if you don't care who parks there?? .... That's right; you just want £16/24 daily fee
It is a bloody nightmare getting in and out of spaces - a car was scraped but driver drove off as the hit car shouldn't have parked where it did but Mario (hotel manager) doesn't care one iota.  Most business guests like myself have larger, expensive cars. 

2.) hotel rooms - blooming basic and nothing special and NOT worth the daily rate.  Tiny, quite worn looking and you You can't swing a cat in the bathroom and the toilet is awful. 

3.) LED TVs, they have been installed for over 8 months now and the signal and reception is still dire and missing the bulk of FREEVIEW channels 

4.) WIFI - a snail can move faster than that speed. 

5.) Charges your credit card as well as invoicing the Company account

6.) the food wasn't overly great in the past but has improved a great deal but the price of the breakfast on top of the room is extortion considering what is on offer

7.) Trees in the carpark will leave your car with a horrid sticky substance all over it - BE WARNED 

Until the above issues are address, I will no longer stay here and will continue to use the Novotel next door for the office or will go further into the city and stay at Radisson Blu, Marriott or DoubleTree. 

This hotel in my view is only suitable for business guests and that's at a push.  If you're a visitor to Bristol for pleasure there are 10 better hotels to choose from"

1136,Bris2l_fashion,2016-06-30,4.0,What happened to the old City Inn Lost in Central Bristol ? Find yourself a cheerful hotel in the old Temple Meadows (shortened to Meads) off Victoria Street leading from Brunel's Great Western Railway to the Bridgestow bridge (the old bridge giving Bristol it's name) and hard on the brutal inner city ring road.  Buy it and put it into the Hilton brand and in the process loose a little of the independent spirit of the City Inn brand that provided brilliant business class experience for Holiday Inn prices.  The walled garden across road from front of hotel is an oasis of calm in England's 8th largest city.  Give a good welcome - charge £16 for parking overnight !! and a breakfast to suite all tastes.  Good consistent quality - ideal for overnights but suspect a little longer would prove too bland and experience.

The room was smaller than expected but had all facilities needed and was really clean and the bed was comfortable. 

The best part of the stay was the breakfast. We had this for £7 which was a special offer. The choice and quality was amazing , probably one of the best breakfasts we've had and definitely good value for money as everything was unlimited . The staff in reception and the restaurant were excellent. 

We woule come back but maybe wouldn't pay as much for the room this time as we do feel the rooms were pretty small for what we paid ."

Very clean and modern rooms with decent desk space and light to work at and very comfortable beds. Has everything you need - fridge, kettle, decent sized shower, ironing boards - and the reception staff are enthusiastic and friendly. Food if you order up is pretty decent though £4 tray charge on top of service charge always galls me. But you can take own food in and the fridges in the room are for this. People tell me the downstairs cafe is pretty good too.  If you can get a discounted room price it's certainly worth staying here."

1149,patrickmX2599SN,2016-06-30,3.0,"Midweek trip  I thought the hotel was very well located. It was clean and had a comfortable and spacious bed, along with some excellent storage and seating in the room. The bathroom was also a very good standard. I was unsure of a couple of things, firstly, the pricing of the car park (£16). The company website through which you can make your booking isn't very clear as to the rate being overall or daily, to the extent I thought this was an overall rate. The front desk also suggested the same but a bill was posted to the room stating £16. I complained and it was refunded which was admirable but I'd like to see the website updated to be more clear as it effects people's pricing of their night's stay. Otherwise, breakfast was quite nice for myself but the salmon option wasn't well received by my girlfriend. For example, it was supposed to come with brioche and it came with brown bread instead. I did enjoy my full English."

1156,cresheim,2016-05-31,4.0,"Two Good Nights in Bristol My wife and I had decided to end our tour of Wales with a day in Bath.  Timing meant that day was the Saturday of May Bank Holiday Weekend.  The Bath hotels were quite simply outrageously priced.  And so it is we chose to spend two evenings in Bristol.

We chose the hotel as it is a Hilton Garden Inn and we are Diamond HHonors members.  The location was great - we could walk from the hotel to the train and be in Bath in less than 20 minutes.  

As for the hotel itself, our room was very clean and the bed exceptionally comfortable (a given from my experienced with HGI).  The room was, however, a bit on the small side.  Comparable to a Hilton Garden Inn I have stayed at in New York City, where you are accustomed to small hotel rooms.

We had room service the first night at the hotel.  The food was ridiculously good for room service.  We visited the bar that night as well - the service was excellent.

We ventured out of the hotel the second evening; the location was perfect for seeking out many great restaurant options.  

The staff at the hotel was was superb.  We needed to do laundry and, as the sundry shop was out of detergent to sell, they kindly brought us detergent, for no charge. 

The Bristol Hilton Garden Inn is highly recommended."

The bed was a good size however the room was tiny. I could have sat at the desk whilst putting my feet up on the chair and lean on the bed! 
The bathroom looked tired and run down. There was no room to swing a cat!
The hotel gave the usual tea coffee gratuities, no water, no biscuits.  There were not the usual dressing gowns and slippers I usually receive in HH.
Breakfast was repetitive but eatable.  I did order dinner via room service, the phone is not compatible with hearing aids and I could not hear anything the person was saying. They came to my room to take my order. When the food arrived it was 'ok'. I'm not a fussy eater by any means. 
I definitely won't stay here again and will revert back to the Mercure!"
1160,alecbowmanclarke,2016-05-31,3.0,"completely fine This place used to be called the Mint hotel and I stayed here with work many moons ago. It's a Hilton now and not quite as good. I remember having an iMac in my room which was great for work, real easy. Now, everything about this hotel is fine. Completely fine. 

Check in was absolutely fine. I was expected and my room was ready. She asked how I was. Helped me find a sandwich. 

The room is small and not as nice as it looks on the website but certainly fine. It's currently (June 2016) surrounded by scaffolding which noisy or really a problem but kind of just feels like it's surrounded by scaffolding. 

The shower is fine. 

The bed isn't huge but it's ok, the mattress isn’t amazing and I didn't sleep well but that was probably only 23% the mattresses fault. Breakfast was fine! Lot's to choose from. The very friendly breakfast lady made me poached eggs and showed me how she got them like that. 

The cereal comes out of one of those cereal crunching machines that you know I hate. 

The iMacs are gone and this is now a soulless city hotel, where thankfully the staff are excellent and that nearly makes up for it."

The walk in shower was very roomy even if the bathroom could be cramped for a large person. Good quality toiletries and big, fluffy towels.  Evening meal was better than expected being in a group. Plenty of choice at breakfast. All staff helpful and friendly. Only downside was the member of staff who came straight into our room not long after we checked in on the pretext of 'checking to see our room was ready'. This even though we had locked the door.  My husband checked her paperwork and advised her that the room she should have been checking was on the floor above!"

The breakfast was the main event, lots of lovely food and plenty of it. Try the waffles, they are lovely. The location is good as just a short bus ride from Cabot circus (unless you're feeling energetic!) and close to the station, didn't hear the traffic but did get woken up by some roadworks on the Friday.

We checked in using the Hilton honours app which was incredibly simple and enabled us to choose a room and meant check in was incredibly simple. The room had everything you needed, however the bathroom was quite cramped, and a few areas were incredibly dusty. The wifi was patchy and slow so difficult to rely on.

Has a small car park which doesn't take long to fill up and the nearest car park closes at 6pm and I didn't notice another car park anywhere nearby. Clean hotel in a good location but nothing special.
1176,Toone03,2016-04-30,4.0,"Great city location Stayed here on business, great location in Bristol and only a 5 minute walk to the station. You can walk to the shops at Cabbots Circus too. Rooms were clean and tidy with free WIFI. Good facilities and gym was well equipped.

Food was good, breakfast was included and lots of choice with eggs cooked to order if you wanted"
1177,T5968JWdavids,2016-05-31,4.0,Nice hotel nice location Stayed here for work for three nights. The staff were very pleasant. The hotel is clean and well presented. We had food which was lovely and good value for money. My room was clean albeit slightly small and cramped but that's being slightly picky. All round nice hotel
1178,Sazerella,2016-02-29,4.0,"Very good I booked 4 rooms directly through Hilton and found the customer services very good and helpful and found the best deal for me with the added bonus of becoming a member to gain points for my next visit.

I received emails welcoming my party before we arrived and also a phone call to inform me of different directions to the carpark due to road works. 

The hotel was immaculate and again hotel receptionist very welcoming and informative. 

The beds were comfy and bathroom very clean. 

The breakfast was exceptional with a great variety of food to choose from. 

There is a small gym which I would have used if I had more time. 

I would definitely stay here again as it is in walking distance of Bristol city centre."
1179,473JohnN,2016-05-31,5.0,"The Garden Inn continues to deliver..... At the end of March I thought my days of staying at the Hilton Garden Inn would be over, but after 6 weeks I am now going to be back in Bristol a couple of nights a week.  What does that mean, it means more great stays with the friendly staff at the Hilton Garden Inn!  I received the same warm welcome, whether it was at reception, in the bar or at breakfast and it is the things like this which will ensure that I book into the HGI whenever I can when I am in Bristol.  Keep up the excellent work!"
1180,uxb,2016-05-31,4.0,"Good hotel I stayed here for one night on a business trip. The room was fairly small but very comfortable with everything you could want in it. The breakfast was good but there was a limited selection. The only issues were: 
1. The car park is very small and getting into spaces is difficult. There are roadworks taking place outside the hotel and the road leading to the car park is blocked at one end and so I went round the block a couple of times trying to work out how to get in.
2. The breakfast area is quite small and when I went down at 8.00 there were no tables and those that became free were not cleared quickly.
3. After breakfast, as I was getting changed a member of staff burst into my room without knocking or checking there was anybody in there. Not a nice thing to happen.
4. The air conditioning kept switching itself off after an hour or so and the room was stifling when I woke up."
1181,markt479,2016-05-31,4.0,Good Quality Hotel in Bristol City Centre Great for meetings and the location is perfect for this fantastic city. Worth staying at. bedrooms conforable and luxurious. Car park is an issue but don't let that put you off. Food is good but a bit pricey. Will return in the near future.

1183,Simoooooooo,2016-05-31,4.0,Not bad hotel  May 14th me and my sissters traveled to bristol for my brothers 30th and stayed at the hilton because it was central to the city center. Arrived around 3 after spending half hour driving round trying to find the hotel cuz the road was closed not hotel .lovley reception welcome from the lady's on the desk got to out room and as we opened our door we were greeted by a lady already in out room ooops clearly not a room for us so back to reception for a.diff room and all ok with that one clean and a nice view .we laughed about the mistake and was given a few free drinks wasn't a problem at all. Can't fault the staff the hotel perfect location and room was lovley was upgraded also for the inconvenience wasn't rely any to be fair not sure how the other guest felt but we saw the funny side . Only thing I would say is as you turn right out the hotel go left there are lots of shops and places to eat we were told to go through the park and right to the city centre with was some shops and pubs but if u go left it's 2 mins away rather than 10 mins. The car park is only small so be aware may not be able park there we managed to park there and wasn't bad price £15 for the day and eve was there same as other hotels.
1184,277suzannek,2016-04-30,3.0,Didnt take the time to email ma back Booked in to the Hilton Garden Inn 29th/30th April. Nice pleasant first night stay. Sunday Morning no hot water and no info as to when hot water would be available. no comment form given. emailed 5/5/16 to manager. Surprise surprise no reply. Very disappointed. First time with negative feedback on any of my reviews.
1185,NanaAma,2016-05-31,5.0,"Really nice stay Hotel facilities were really nice (as expected) a welcome plate of brownies awaited us at check in. Travel cot was supplied with minutes of check in and all staff were very polite and efficient. Breakfast was lovely. Location was great, about a 10min stroll to main high Street and canal walks. There is also a 'guest laundry' that can be used, particularly handy if you have been away a long time or just need to freshen up a few items of clothing (pay by change). Highly recommend staying here."
1186,LisaParker503796,2016-05-31,5.0,Thanks Grace! This excellent lady sorted out a problem with a voucher that we submitted for a 3 course meal and a champagne cocktail. Although I had phoned with details of our voucher the restaurant had no record of my booking and we found that they didn't accept these vouchers any more either. Grace made enquiries and also tried to find a Hilton hotel in Bristol that did take our voucher but with no success. We decided to leave but Grace insisted that we should stay and again went off to decide what should be done. We were offered a complimentary main meal and a glass of  prosecco. I have posted this review because I believe that Grace went above and beyond what most hotels would have done and did so in a calm and very gracious way. I hope the Garden Inn recognises her worth as much as we do. Thanks Grace for saving our evening out.

It was arranged through the group booking department and specifically Amy Newman , who was absolutely fantastic from the outset and ensuring we got the exact rooms and room types for our party. I cannot thank her enough for all of her assistance. The excellent service we received  continue on arrival with the assistant from Laura - Reception Manager. The hotel was exceptionally comfortable and clean and within walking to the city centre where you can find everything that may interest you. The group many of whom travel a considerable amount fro business trips were extremely impressed with the high professional quality of people who attended us throughput our stay, which was mainly the bar or mainly at the reception. Staff are really top quality, This was my first stay, and I can say with confidence that I will be making another visit. From the exceptionally helpful staff who could not do enough for you, I will not hesitate to recommend this inn to anyone thinking of visiting Bristol. In addition to the fantastic staff, the breakfast and breakfast options were one of the best hotel breakfasts i have eaten in a hotel and this was echoed by many of the group member. Fantastic all round . Thank You"

As we entered the hotel it was very clean, welcoming and the staff were very helpful, professional and approchable.  Our room was very clean, comfortable and fresh, and not forgetting the comfortable bed for a restful night sleep after touring Bristol. There was a varity of choices for breakfast but unfortunately we were in a rush so didn not get a chance to enjoy it but I would recommend you enjoy it.  Checking out was trouble free an envelope with our bill was put under the door so we knew exactly what to pay hence speeding the checkout process.  I would recommend this hotel."

Staff very friendly however when we checked in we were told that our booking was room only - not bed and breakfast as was actually booked. After checking the staff made several phone calls and confirmed we were correct. Room fine however accommodation is snug and bathroom tiny with no bath. Location good for sightseeing and restaurants. Breakfast good.

Upon checking out we were told that we needed still to pay for the room! Obviously the booking system is not the most efficient!"

Close enough to Railway station to be ablw to walk to the hotel. Rooms are spotless although not as big as a double tree. The staff are  very welcoming  and helpful.

1194,clare_ace,2016-04-30,5.0,"Friendly and convenient hotel We stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn for one night for a family reunion.
The hotel is very well placed - only a few minutes walk from Temple Meads station.
I loved that with The Hilton, you can check in online and choose your room!

The lady at the front desk was super friendly on check in.  We were on the top floor with a park view.
The room was smallish but clean and modern.  There were the standard facilities - plus some convenient extras such as Iron & board in the room, and an empty fridge for you to keep your own food in if you want.  Good shower pressure too.

We hadn't paid for breakfast but changed our minds in the morning - there is a cafe attached to the hotel.  The breakfast was top notch! Excellent eggs and bacon.  The staff in there were super friendly too - trying to convince us to eat more!

Feedback from the rest of our party who were also staying at the same place was equally positive. 

Highly recommend for a short break in Bristol!"
1195,HollyJemima17,2016-03-31,4.0,"Good city break Visited with 2 other couples for my friends birthday weekend. Really nice rooms and fantastic breakfast! The breakfast is served all morning and there is a great choice, as always with Hilton breakfasts! Really helpful staff who gave us some advice and directions. You do have to pay for parking which was pricey. The hotel is in a great location, easy walking distance to Cabbot Circus. Our only issue was that three times our door key stopped working!
Would definitely go again :)"
1196,ciaram491,2016-05-31,2.0,Go elsewhere For the money we paid this was not a valuable experience. Staff are lovely but the breakfast experience was like a school canteen. There were dirty dishes left all over the tables and staff who were struggling to cope with the demand.
1197,KenPBATH,2016-04-30,4.0,"Excellent(And Free) Our flight was cancelled and we ariived here with about 24 others for the night. Although in a group we were quickly booked in. Our room was at the rear with a view of the park and was spotless with no marks or carpet stains that you can get. I thought it was so good it must have been new or refurbished but appartently not.Quiet with no noise from inside or out apart from the corridor music if you opened the door.
Had a meal which was very good for an hotel with pleasant and attentive staff.(My view was not cloded by the fact it was free)
Quickly booked out in the morning and throughout our stay could not fault the staff.
The park,church and area surrounding at the rear is well worth a visit."

1199,BUSTYBREEZER,2016-04-30,3.0,"Very noisy which led to no sleep We stayed this weekend for 1 night and for me it was a night of no sleep. The welcome at reception was great and although we had to wait for our rooms this was fine. We had reserved 5 rooms in total including the 4 I had booked myself. We had been advised that there would be no water at the hotel for the first few hours after arrival, although this notice was only 2 days before arrival. We were not able to have a shower before going out in the evening or flush toilets ect and we were not compensated for this in anyway. Unfortunately due to the short notice and needing 5 rooms we were unable to book elsewhere to stay which appeared to be the suggestion of the hotel.
This saying the hotel was clean, modern and well equiped and the shortness of water did affect us but did not ruin our stay. What did ruin my stay was the lack of sleep. We were in a 1st floor room above reception and the noise through out the night of groups of men swearing, shouting, arguing, talking excessively very loudly, taxi's pulling up, beeping horns, doors slamming inside and outside the hotel and below my bedroom was completly unacceptable. I phoned down to reception in the middle of the night to complain about the noise and they explained that they had already spoken with the gentlemen and understood what i meant, so they would approach them again. However, the noise continued and i spoke with reception in the morning who acknowledged my complaint in a professional manner. The breakfast choice and quality of food was excellent and so were the staff members in the restaurant.
I have no complaints with the hotel other than the noise and the lack of water and would have given 5/5 if it wasnt for these aspects."

Would definitely stay again, but avoid the car park, I went to park in there but got stuck as it was full and I then spent the next 20 mi Utes trying to get out again resulting in a phone call to the hotel so that someone could come and rescue me. Hotel itself was fab though"
1203,wo589,2016-04-30,3.0,"Clean but small Had a problem at check in, no parking spaces left, told to park on the curb and wait for one. The rooms and bathroom are small but clean and the ""stock your fridge yourself"" idea is a nice touch. The Tv was new and big but limited channels and kept loosing its signal. It's a taxi ride into town, use a licenced one as the mini cads will try to rip you off. (£10 asked for but only £6 in a meter one) . The staff are warm and friendly and breakfast was fine. An OK hotel if a little expensive for what is a well appointed travel lodge hotel"

Rooms aren't large, but they're bright and clean with comfortable beds and great showers. Usual facilities in room such as WiFi, digital tv, tea & coffee, iron, hairdresser etc.
Breakfast is generally good, fresh omelettes etc, but I'm not really a fan of the self-service tea and coffee"

Saturday breakfast was lovely and the hotel staff were all very pleasant.
Saturday night, however, was a different story. A group of people on our corridor were preparing for a night out, in and out of each other's rooms, slamming the door every time, they went out at about 11pm so it went quiet until about 3am when they returned and the door slamming started again every few minutes until 7am.
When we commented on this to the receptionist, as it does promise you a guaranteed good night, her response was ""it is noisy on a Saturday night""!!!"

Perfectly situated for the train station and city centre. Things to think about are a lot of STAG parties stayed there that weekend and also forquented the city centre. Overall I was very satisfied. Also you need to pay for your parking at £12 a day.
1210,H1911UIpauls,2016-04-30,4.0,"Clean, friendly hotel, not too far from town centre I have stayed here several times when on business trips as it is close to the offices I was visiting, but I chose the same hotel each time for the following reasons.  Pros:  The hotel is easy to get to by car though parking might be a little tight.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The rooms are clean, reasonably spacious, have ironing boards and irons, and fridges (all essentials for long business journeys).  Big TV with reasonable sound!  The showers are powerful enough and the heads are not fixed to the wall (I hate weedy showers and fixed heads).  The air conditioning is good enough to keep a room reasonably cool.  The bar has a few interesting beers and spirits in, alongside the usual blandness.  Dinner was acceptable but nothing to write home about, breakfast was very good (if you like full English) with reasonable variety, the coffee is acceptable.  The town centre is only around 5 minutes walk away, with a variety of places to eat and drink.   On the negative side, not very much to report:  The beds are oddly lumpy but that hasn't stopped me sleeping deeply on those rare occasions when I do.  The wifi coverage is hit or miss (mostly miss when you are in your room) and performance was patchy.  Not enough free power sockets in a room and not well positioned (at the desk I had to unplug the kettle and the lamp so I could plug in my laptop and stuff - not onerous but a pain when you then need light or a cuppa as well!)."
1211,414stevieb,2016-04-30,5.0,"Brilliant Stayed for 2 nights- lovely room- helpful staff- great position- highly recommend to others: booked via late rooms so got a bargain as well. Room was clean- maybe a bit warm , bed was comfortable , shower powerful and hot.

Room was clean good size
Perfect location everything is very local 

I have one small complaint in regards to room service 

The first night the food was ok however the second night I rand for about 15mins before someone picked the phone ordered same salad as first night I was very disappointed with the presentation, portion few ingredients were missing and the chips was cold.

I paid almost £13 for a bowl of salad and this is what I got 

It's not letting me add the pics 

I would defiantly not recommend the room service food you can literally walk 5mins down the road and you will have a wide rang of options and several restaurants"

Very easy to find just off the main road if you are arriving by car and by train, it is a short walk away. There is a carpark at the front with adequate spaces, we have had no problem parking. The rooms are large enough, tastefully furnished with a modern decor. The bathrooms are light and bright with a large shower. We had a room overlooking the park, which you have to pay a little more for, but worth it because the other side of the hotel overlooks the busy and noisy road. Breakfasts are brilliant!! Seated very promptly, lots of choice and delicious. The staff are all very friendly, particularly the Hungarian barman who is a star!!"

Easily accessible from the main train station and only a short walk away from the city centre, it's perfectly located.

Check-in was smooth, staff were friendly and efficient, and one of the staff members surprised us by speaking a perfect French ..... how's that for feeling at home (for a French speaker that is) ?

The room was clean and bright, although we could have used a bit more storage space. Bed was very comfortable and the shower just perfect.

Stain on the carpet, not sure if it was blood or a marker? Didn't really want to investigate. Quite a way from centre for night out but good nights sleep"
1231,545majellaf,2016-03-31,5.0,"Stay at Bristol, Hilton Garden Inn Excellent hotel, unlike some of the business stay hotels I normally stay in the UK. The staff deserve a specific mention as they went way above what is required to make my stay really pleasant. There was a problem with the local road works so that I had difficulty finding the place. However, hope that is just a short term blip for this excellent hotel."
1232,836traceyw,2016-03-31,4.0,"""Excellent overnight stay"" Excellent clean hotel, near all amenities and car park was empty which was good, the only down side was the bed was hard and a bit high, other than that it was a good night stop over. Staff were very friendly. We had room service late on of a burger and pannini and that was lovely."
1233,DisGeek_Kerry,2016-03-31,3.0,"Good location, bed and car park not the greatest. We just arrived home after a 2 night stay in this hotel. At the moment we are trying to build up Hilton points so it was between this hotel and the Doubletree.

We arrived at the hotel to find the worlds smallest car park. There are not many spaces though you can park opposite the spaces on white lines, however it is very tight.

My OH chose the room via the Hhonors app before checking in. Check in was quick and easy, and the receptionist was helpful and efficient. The room in all was small but had a modern toilet room and shower, we were also very pleasantly surprised to find a heated mirror. The room had a hairdryer, desk and mirror, wardrobe, tea making facilities and a fantastic HUGE TV opposite the bed. More light around the mirror area would be appreciated as at one point I ended up aiming the reading lamps over towards me.

Our bed however did not match the rest of the room. Whenever my OH rolled over in the middle of the night I felt as though I was experiencing a theme park ride with bouncing and loud noises, at one point I thought I'd broken the bed from sitting down to fast. Both of us woke up with sore backs and necks, we may have just been unlucky with the mattress we had.

In all it was a decent hotel for the money, we paid for breakfast in the hotel which had quite a large selection buffet. If it wasn't for the back breaking bed and the tight fit carpark I would have definitely rated it higher."
1234,267AshleyS,2016-03-31,4.0,"A truly wonderful flawlessly run hotel with one total dealbreaker To start with this was one of the best run hotels in its class I think i have ever stayed in. It's wonderfully maintained. Perfectly clean and fresh. Newly refurbished and (most) of the staff are a credit. The rooms are lovely but TINY just about manageable for a single person but in no way a queen room with barely enough space for one person to move around and no way to open the wardrobe without some serious furniture rearranging but again as a single traveller that was manageable and the rest of the hotel was great

Breakfast was very nice and the resteraunt was fresh and airy

Sadly the deal breaker for me and the reason I had to cut my visit short and move hotels was the beds.. I was sleeping alone so I can only imagine the problem would be exacerbated if you tried (God knows how) to fit on two people! Although the pillows were comfy enough it was the single most uncomfortable bed I have ever come across. So hard and lumpy I barely slept for 3 days and when I did wake i was in so much pain in my back and throughout my body (and im only 31 years old with no history of back pain) I was forced to run to boots for heavy painkillers and take these by the bucketload each day. I did comment on this to the staff and they did tell me all the rooms are the same and my room was actually an upgrade.. 

It really is a shame because it is a FABULOUS hotel and with such lovely staff but if you can't sleep its not viable for me at least. If you are a lone traveller and comfortable with very very very hard beds and no need to no move during the night you might be ok with it but until the beds are remedied I won't be able to return."

Bathroom had good quality fittings, a powerful shower and a good selection of premium cosmetics.  The room had good soundproof windows as we couldn't hear anything from outside.  Large flatscreen TV wall mounted in front of bed.  We didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that.  Reception staff were friendly.  They also had a 'pantry' area with drinks, alcohol and snacks available for purchase 24hours and I believe there was  a room service option.  We read about the parking costs beforehand so were not surprised and I believe £12 for 24 hours is quite responsible for Bristol city centre."

We went out both nights we were there, and the hotel was quite lively, but then again so were we. 

The rooms were smaller than the usual Hilton room, but the Shower was amazing, perfect pressure and never once ran out of hot water. 

We did have a problem with the TV one morning, but we reported it when we went down for Breakfast, and it was fixed when we returned. 

Breakfast was amazing, freshly cooked and plentiful, you just helped yourself, and the chef done you eggs or an omlette the way you wanted."

Shower/TV/lighting and room seating were all very good. The clock radio wasn't working. Breakfast was well served, fresh and good quality. The room rate was at the competitive level for Bristol central and 24 hours secure parking was £12."

I contacted Mariana before our arrival and upon entering our room, there was a 'happy birthday' plate of desserts.  This set the tone of our visit and we found all the Hilton staff helpful in advising on places to visit, arranging taxis and advising on bus timetables.  The front of the building is a bit 70s concrete block but the exit leading to Temple Park is beautiful with a small park, ruins of a church offering a shortcut to St. Nicholas Market, the harbour and Broadmead shopping centre.  Our room was spotless and quiet despite it being a busy weekend within the hotel.  Exceeded our expectations and we would use this hotel again."

The staff are great, the rooms superb and the breakfast is to die for(as long as you order your omelette when you first sit down as it takes some time to arrive) It WAS worth waiting for though.

Breakfast buffet good but not outstanding.

Unfortunately on the downside, parking is inadequate for the size of the hotel. The room was quite small. The worst thing though was the bed, which was small, hard and creaked whenever you moved. Would probably be ok for a single traveller, but not for couples, and definitely not for a romantic get away(fortunately that was not the purpose for this trip)"
1253,Q4645LKchrisw,2016-02-29,5.0,"Excellent value for money and brilliant staff. Made a booking through booking.com which was a mistake - website glitch ended up resetting dates I had chose and I managed to book 3 weeks early. Thankfully they sorted this out with Hilton Garden but as a downside it cost a bit more for breakfast. Hilton Garden waived this for me, but I would have been perfectly happy paying for this had I known what I was getting. The breakfast selection was massive. The room itself was good, in tidy condition, bed was clean and comfortable, TV was nice and modern (although it was mounted a little bit wonky and me and my OCD girlfriend had to try and not notice it... Room 112...ahhh ;]  )

The staff were excellent. I think it was Laura behind the main desk. But every one on reception was extremely courteous and made us feel at home. We were allowed a bit extra for checkout and they held our bags safe while we explored the city.

The lady who attended the Breakfast station on Monday morning was extremely polite and welcoming.

I would definitely come again and would recommend it to any body on the fence about where to stay in Bristol. Thanks everyone for a great stay."

For some reason the book in took a little time leading to others waiting, I was just lucky the dest was empty when I arrived, more staff on the front desk is a must. The rooms were clean and as it was a lads away day the size of the room did not bother any of us, If we had been staying longer the size of the room would not have been to our standard, too small. Never eat in the hotel as you are a short walk into the town centre, we did use the bar and again as every hotel for some reason they feel they must inflate the prices, why do hotels do this? Checking out was easy. Overall a pleasent stay with no problems."

(many times sea- bass can be over cooked) The breakfast was also good with plenty of staff on to ensure speedy service. i really do believe this hotel is geared towards the commercial user, which for the commercial user is just great.However for pleasure the hotel is in a good location with easy access to the city would also be a great place to stay."

Moreover, the room was clean and the breakfast was very good, staff very friendly again with a great range of delicious  food.

I really recommend this hotel for your visit to Bristol."
1258,27paule,2016-02-29,4.0,Weekend Pretty well pleased generally although I think the hotel more suited to business visitors because of the location.  Very much business district of the city.   The room was fairly small with only quite minimum storage.  Very clean room and this goes for the hotel in general.   The breakfast was excellent and well staffed and provided lots of choice.    Our only dissatisfaction was with the bed which was uncomfortable and creaked at every turn
1259,GideonLondon,2016-02-29,3.0,"Mixed It is a clean modern hotel with nice rooms - but and there are buts ... Some bits of it were a but rubbish.

The staff told us the bar food ends at 10 - so we dashed there not to find it actually closes at 11:00.

The pizza I had was like cardboard and my colleague's veg burger was like something from the 70s. Another colleague's gammon steak was ok - but it's really unacceptable for a Hilton not even to be able to provide decent pub grub.

The heating in the room didn't seem to be up to much and the Internet, whilst free (a really great thing) kept cooking out.

The sort of hotel which given a bit of attention by management could be so much better - little changed can make a big difference. 

Overall a decent business place to stay fit a night but could do better"

1261,Raiya86,2016-02-29,3.0,"Definitely not a Hilton standard The minute we got there the First Lady on reception named monika was awful, she had disgusting customer service skills and when we asked her a question about parking she told us to go and find your own parking!
This is very much a loud party hotel, women were screaming from 2am in the morning until 6am, behaviour you would expect in a cheap hotel not of a Hilton standard:
The beds were uncomfortable and hard, the heating didn't work nor did the safe or refrigerator and I had two rooms and they were both as bad as each other.

There were a few members of staff who were helpful but other than that their was nothing else to write home about!"
1262,817catd,2016-02-29,4.0,"Comfy stay I'd like to start this review by saying that the Hilton is always a lovely, comfy stay, and my criticisms may well have been corrected if I had brought them up with a very helpful reception! The location is fab and the room was large, comfy and a treat to stay in. I'd give constructive feedback by noting the following

1. The conditioner provided in the room had been used and was nearly empty (not an issue as I had brought my own however)
2. I was in a room close to the lift and the sound of the lift arriving was a bit annoying, although it stopped before it got so late that it would disturb my sleep
3. Although there is free internet, the signal in my room was so poor it didn't work properly.

Onto the good points though, the reception team were wonderfully friendly and helpful with all my questions and the location was fab and the bed comfy, which is really enough from a hotel to sleep in and nothing else. I might have expected more had I been travelling for pleasure and not business but that is splitting hairs."

1264,SJS15,2016-02-29,3.0,"Disappointing hotel It's many years since I last stayed in Bristol on business. I chose this hotel for convenience to the office, the evening restaurant and a conference venue I was going to the next morning. When I arrived I remembered this was actually the hotel I stayed at before eight or nine years ago when it was branded a Park Inn. I remembered it then as a very comfortable hotel.

This time I was disappointed. The check in was ok but took ages and had the other more experienced receptionist not intervened would have taken even longer. The room wasn't huge but that wasn't a problem for a night's stay and it had everything I wanted other than a slightly bizarre half locked but empty fridge. It had a comfortable desk chair too. My main complaint about the room was that the wifi was appalling - kept dropping out and the speed was excruciatingly slow when it did work. This would have been a significant problem had I been staying for longer and wanted to work in the room. Also the room was very stuffy - the traffic noise meant I couldn't sleep with the window open and the air con refused to drop the temperature much below 21C. This led to a poor night's sleep.

Breakfast was ok but nothing special. The staff were very friendly though.

Overall I won't be returning. I am sure there must be more comfortable business hotels when I next stop in the city."

Check in was quick and efficient

I had a park view room which was nice and quiet. 

The room was spotlessly clean and comfortable. 

The bar was well stocked and the breakfast was great. It's nice to find a hotel who offer more than plastic cheese and wafer ham as the continental choice

I'm glad I didn't arrive by car as a couple of colleagues struggled to park

The only items that stopped it getting 5 stars were the parking and bar prices.

Breakfast buffet excellent.  Additional option of having smoked salmon and scrambled egg or omelette made fresh to order - fantastic!  Continental choice also great.  Breakfast available until 11 am at weekends which was nice for those of us looking to unwind and recharge batteries.

Park room really pleasant, design features functional and practical.  Room not enormous but more than adequate for two people for a weekend.  Good quality toiletries - included conditioner which was unexpected.  Wifi reasonable for leisure use.

Hotel in business district, however really easy, short walk to city centre.

1272,SmartCookina,2016-02-29,3.0,"Definitely below Hilton standards. Very unimpressed. 

The good:
The Staff: really helpful, friendly and professional.
The location: 12 minute walk from Bristol city center 
Breakfast is all you can eat buffet
Park view rooms are quiet

The bad:
I supposedly had a Queen evolution room, but it is in my opinion just a fancy name for ""very normal double room"".
The bed was squeaking like a pissed off squirrel. 
The choices of channels on TV were extremely limited.
The bathroom supplies (shampoo, etc) were below average
The room, and by extention the hotel, didn't have any classy feeling to it, and resembled what you get at a 3 star chain, for twice the price (and it was on offer).
Breakfast: Eating as much as you want often comes at a price: you need to forget about quality. And that breakfast wasn't a exception to the rule.

The ugly:
A painfully slow internet connection
£12 a day parking that you cannot book. It's first come first served. It was full both days.
Empty minibar. You have to go out of the room and buy your drinks near reception

 Conlcusion:
Was it horrible? No. Again, staff were really good - without them this review would have been a 2 star one. But it wasn't a unforgettable experience either. I've stayed in cheaper 3 star hotels that had more class."

As it's such a distance to get something to eat in the evening there is a microwave in the pavilion which is by the reception area which is very handy.

I would definitely stay again."
1283,Jaybird6,2016-01-31,4.0,"Very pleasant I stayed here recently for one night on business. Location is very good - 5 minute walk from the train station (especially if you know the short cut, avoiding the main road. 
Check in toom a while as there was a queue when I arrived, but the process was smoothe enough. 
The room was very nice and included a laptop safe, which is always a bonus. I ate in he restaurant where I was served very competently by Ana F. The restaurant was rather noisy as a large group were eating together. Food was pleasant
I slept well and check out was very efficient. If I had one complaint it was that the TV wasn't working properly (kept losing signal). When I mentioned this on check, the staff said that they were aware of the issue anc that it was affecting the whole hotel. It may have been nice to forewarn people on check-in that this was the case. On balance, I would certainly stay again."
1284,140lynseya,2016-01-31,4.0,"Nice rooms, ok location, decent for business travel Easy check in with no hassle, first impressions on entry were good.
We managed to get a parking space but i can imagine that can be a bit of a fight at times as its limited.
Its off a very busy road in but you couldn't hear a peep when inside. We came in at peak time so it was a pain to get to - meaning we could see the hotel for 15minutes before we could actually park up - try get there out of peak hours.

It doesn't have the biggest of dining and bar area but the staff were very attentive. The breakfast in the morning is very very good - excellent selection as well as international selection. A chef is on hand to make you something to your liking which is always good.

The room was modern, clean and comfy. The bathroom was on the small side but the shower made up for that - its always a danger in hotels that the shower just dribbles on you but this was not the case - full force to wake you up with a steady temp.
The tv reception was off as they has just had maintenance so not the best but i was out on the cocktails so shrugged that off - im sure they would of helped if i persisted on that matter."
1285,beaconsgang,2015-12-31,2.0,"shocking customer service Bristol
We were due to stay in York but at the last minute had to cancel due to the floods so quickly found an alternative city to visit. We chose Bristol as there is so much to do and Bath is only a short train ride away. We booked two rooms via booking.com, for 28 and 29 December, we decided to book the best rooms available as it was a post-Christmas treat so booked the queens rooms with park view. The park is small but could make out the cardboard boxes/homeless tent. There is a car park on site for £12 a day so were able to leave the car safely for the duration of our stay. The train station was only a few minutes walk away with regular trains to and from Bath.

I had to provide my credit card details to confirm even though we were paying by cash - fair enough. On arrival we confirmed we would be paying separately, one couple by debit card and ourselves by cash. We were told they needed to pre-authorise my credit card but payment would be due when we checked out, again no problem.

We decided to put the cases in the rooms, quick freshen up and meet in the bar to decide a plan of action. The menu looked appetising but when we paid for the first drink it was so expensive we figured we would be better dining out at one of the many lovely restaurants in Bristol.

Unfortunately I was unwell so didn't do as much as we would have liked but still We had a lovely stay, the shopping choice is great and found a couple of lovely places to dine. The choice down by the river is huge.

Bath cathedral is lovely and we had an enjoyable stroll around.

Sleep was bad but being unwell didn't help so maybe on another stay I would have found the room more comfortable. Breakfast was great with a varied choice.
 
We checked out and paid for the rooms plus parking charge by debit card/cash as per our booking. We visited Bath that day leaving our car on the car park and went via train and really enjoyed the walk round the town, and our visit to the baths which really is a fab museum and well worth a visit. We ended our visit by dining at at Grillstock smokehouse in a converted railway vault. We were served quickly and really enjoyed the burgers/pulled pork. Not the best restaurant I have ever visited but it was quirky and the food was good.

We returned to the hotel, got in the car and returned home thinking all in all we had had a good visit. Then I noticed my credit card had also been charged by the hotel for one of the rooms. I called and was told they would look into it and get back to me. When nobody returned my call father a couple of days I sent an email with all the details and explaining I had paid by cash yet my card had also been chargedI received one back the following day saying they would look into it and get back to me. Finally I sent another email to the manager expressing my disgust at the customer service and asked them to get the police in to check the cctv so they could see us paying by cash. I then received an email from the manager 9 January, saying the police weren't necessary, they could see that I had paid cash and it was an error that the charge hadn't been cancelled from my credit card and that is a pre-authorisation amount. I was told the transaction would be cancelled and that it is normal for it to take 10 working days to be removed and that the manager will be in touch to let me know when it will appear in my account. Tonight (12 January) I called my bank to check it is a pre-authorisation transaction and they said it is a debit transaction that I will be charged interest on. I then emailed manager again. 13 January email received from the manager saying their finance officer is now looking into it. 28 January - No further contact received and no refund and have now been charged interest by credit card company on the transaction so now reported to credit company, maybe they will have better luck than me getting money back

Have to say it soured the visit and if I return to Bristol it will not be to the Hilton."
1286,bcsanders,2016-01-31,4.0,"Bristol nights I had two nights at this hotel in Bristol. The hotel is comfortable and quiet, Internet is free and excellent. Check-in was slow and I saw queues at the front desk quite often. Efficient processing but understaffing problem. Should have fast-track mechanisms for online pre-check-in and for HHonors elite members but no such mechanisms evident. At least the free internet meant I could work while I waited to check in.

Room is a good size. TV is good although I would have liked more channels. Bathroom is a bit cramped and has a weird shower door that makes getting in an out a bit difficult. I stubbed my toes a couple of times in the room - layout could be better and/or slippers provided but didn't see slippers. Breakfast is good - typical selection of food for a UK hotel. They do a nice gratis espresso at breakfast if you ask for it.

Hotel is close to the main train station about 5' walk. Location was convenient for me given where I was visiting. I would stay here again."
1287,476kenm,2016-01-31,3.0,"Standards have slipped  I regularly stayed in this hotel last year.
My last stay however was rather disappointing as the hotel now appears to have a lot of relatively new and inexperienced staff.
Never got or was offered the complimentary water, as expected as a silver member.
Shower in room was cold until it had ran for over five minutes, good luck with that if you're in a hurry.
Finally there was little or no power in the shower.
Good to hear that the chap checking me out was sorry about that.
Think I will be looking elsewhere if I have the option..sorry about that."
1288,flippytoetap,2016-01-31,5.0,Lovely We were only here one night and It was perfect. Great location (for the town and the airport) lovely helpful staff and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. Free parking was a lovely bonus! Would certainly recommend and happily return again.
1289,Gash73,2016-01-31,4.0,Nice Hotel Pleasant room though smaller than we thought it would be.  The bar was good and breakfast was really nice.  Great location easily within walking distance of the city centre bars and restaurants and Cabot Circus.
1290,Skippy88,2016-01-31,4.0,"Great hotel in central bristol Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in January. Reception was quick and easy, staff did not seem to know however how to go to the city centre (Arnolfini building), was told I could not walk there (too far) while I discovered I was 7 minutes from it. Another staff fortunately stepped in and gave me directions, which was good. Hotel location is therefore great, not far from the old part of the city but very quiet. Room was hyper clean, compact and I really appreciate the big flat screen tv and amenities in bathroom. I had asked for a high flirt and was given a 1st floor room. Thought street level noise would be annoying but was surprised by the quietness of the room, probably because of the double glazing. Door's lock was a bit too hard, closing doors would each time make a bit of noise which was slightly unpleasant. Hotel provided free newspapers and the highlight of the stay was the breakfast buffet, fresh, lots of variety: pastries, fruits, English breakfast ingredients, the whole lot, yum and at 13.95 pounds it was a great deal, particularity on cold winter mornings! 
I advise people to take the back door an walk thru the park, you'll be amazed by the beautiful Pisa-tower like church."
1291,406joannet,2016-01-31,4.0,"Lovely and great price  Lovely room (evolution room with park view) for a great price with lots of little extras and nice shampoo/body lotion in the shower etc. Close to the city centre and some lovely restaurants etc. Facilities are good with bar, cafe and small shop so would highly recommend for a short break in Bristol. Am only marking down to four stars because of the very small car park."
1292,Tiggerwilde,2015-11-30,4.0,"Good Base for staying in Bristol Stay for 1 night as a couple, great hotel, clean and comfortable room, couldn't fault.

1295,clive63Exmouth,2016-01-31,4.0,Worth Staying Here My wife and I stayed for two nights. We were met with a simple warm welcome quick and easy what you want. The room forth floor was clean tidy warm no complaints and had all we needed. Car parking isn't that cheap however Hole in the wall car park a five minute walk is the cheaper option if you can be bothered. Easy walkable distant to shops city centre and riverside areas. Recommend The Hole in The Wall for a Roast cosy welcoming and great food. We didn't eat in the Hotel so no comment. Fitness room small but effective. This Hotel is simple effective and convenient recommended.
1296,Britgirl90,2016-01-31,4.0,"Fantastic staff and well presented We stayed here for one night when going out for the evening in bristol. Fabulous warm reception staff with a thank you to Laura who was so welcoming and helpful. The rooms were well presented and finished to a high standard. My only reason that we put 4 stars is that when we left we noticed the duvet inside was quite stained and could probably do with replacement. We had a meal in the evening and were pleasantly surprised. We loved the meal, very tasty and waitresses again gave fantastic service. The breakfast was brill with cold meats and cheeses, full english and pastries. Just what you need after a night out! So overall a lovely stay but was not a nice surprise to see the condition of the duvet after we had slept in it! But I can't speak highly enough of the staff and would definitely visit again!"
1297,20keithh,2016-01-31,5.0,"Helpful and smiling starts off the day Easy access by road or rail, in the city but not in the centre, great hospitality, easy parking, great food, helpful staff.

The room was clean, free internet which was great, convenient parking just outside the hotel and in a great location for Bristol city centre. Thank you."
1299,AygoGoGo,2015-02-28,5.0,Lovely hotel. Would go back This has been one of our favourite stays in the Hilton Chain. The room was comfortable and really clean. We liked the fact it had the flat screen TV and also a fridge which came in handy as we like to take a small container of milk for our cups. We will be spending another night there again. The bed was exceptionally comfortable too.
1300,flyingbutterwings,2016-01-31,3.0,"Take a deep breath...  You'll need to take a deep breath in should you be looking to navigate around the end of the bed and around your room. The hilton garden Inn rooms are certainly not spacious.

Having stayed here on a number of occasions I've also witnessed really rather inconsistent levels of service with staff ranging from uninterested to actually rather rude. 

Rooms are well appointed if cramped, breakfast is good and the location isn't bad. This hotel is fine for a flying visit or overnight on business but certainly not somewhere to stop and enjoy."
1301,Z7418OGsimong,2015-09-30,4.0,"Great location and good rooms Stayed in this hotel twice over the past 12 months - once on work and once on pleasure, and really enjoyed it both times. Excellent staff, good rooms with a great chair and tv system and good breakfast."
1302,976aleksandrap,2015-11-30,3.0,"Good stay I have stayed in this hotel for one night while on a business trip. My room was a Queen room however the size was quite small. There is only shower cabin in the bathroom however it looks quite cosy and there are nice complimentary toiletries, too. The room has panoramic window that faces the park. The food in the restaurant is superb - thank you! 
Cons: would not recommend for a long stay as rooms appear to be quite small. 
Pros: excellent location."
1303,SMOD,2015-12-31,4.0,"Great experience at a bargain price. Visited here with some of my family over Christmas. The staff were great, friendly and professional. The rooms were as you would expect, very clean and comfortable. I'd recommend the ones at the back (park view). Breakfast was also excellent value and quality. The hotel wasn't busy which may explain why we felt so well cared for but much much better than I had anticipated. We didn't go for the shopping but the hotel is very centrally located. I certainly would use again."
1304,387bethanw,2016-01-31,4.0,"Good stay I have just returned after staying at this hotel for new year for 2 nights. I couldn't fault the hotel as a whole. The staff were friendly on welcome and very helpful.
However I was disappointed that the shower in my room as I was using it went freezing and then scorching hot and I could not change this. I found this very dangerous and was disappointed to have experienced this."
1305,Traveler810384,2015-12-31,4.0,"Good value Easy to find with enough parking in front of the hotel and an additional car park behind if the car park is full. Welcome was good, rooms comfortable and clean - although with shower rather than bath, if that matters to you. I walked into town in under 10 minutes, so location worked for me too.

I only had coffee for breakfast, but those around me seemed to be eating well. The coffee was the proper stuff too...none of your button pressing espresso machine ersatz coffee here. 

I'll stay again - what's not to like?"
1306,Bertie500,2015-12-31,3.0,"Good central location, but it's just a Hilton Garden Unfortunately the Garden variant of Hilton name does not have the usual trimmings, but I accept its a budget level hotel.
This one s OK, it's a building that has been through a couple of hotel guises in recent years. The rooms are quite small, but furnishing level is practical and OK. Shower took ages to get warm, just a minor thing. Other wise room fine.
Breakfast was good for a buffet style.
WiFI worked OK in the room and was free.
Only downside was parking charge, why oh why does a hotel need to charge £12 a night for the use of its own car park ??"
1307,473JohnN,2015-12-31,5.0,"I'll be back! Today was my last stay at the Hilton Garden Inn this year....and after almost 60 nights spent here in the last 7 months, I know that it will only be a matter of time before I am staying again!  Why?  Well the location is great; handy for the station, great for walking into town, the rooms are comfortable and clean (although I am not a fan of the shower in room 230 which has a mind of its own), the food always looks and tastes fantastic but more importantly because of the staff!  I have never met a more friendly team in a hotel, even at 0615 hrs when I checked out this morning I was greeted with a smile and a pleasant conversation at both reception and in breakfast.......it is not what is expected but it is very much appreciated!  Thank you for making my 2 or 3 night stays in Bristol so simple and I look forward to seeing you all again on the 4th of January!  

Merry Christmas and all the best for 2016!  John :-) x"
1308,K965JRrobinw,2015-12-31,2.0,"Poor staff experience & Limited Facilities This Hotel lacks any kind of feel good factor. You were left with the feeling that you were an annoyance rather than a guest. Yes, the hotel is clean and rooms average, but you feel like a number, and the staff made no effort to improve the experience, just doing the bare minimum to make your stay functional. Ok for a business trip if the price is right, but I would never consider this Hotel for leisure."
1309,351premk,2015-11-30,3.0,"BUDGET HOTEL UNDER HILTON PORTFOLIO! Recently I visited Bristol and stayed at this hotel. I drove from Blackpool, took about 3 and a half hours, easily reached the hotel because of the convenient city centre location. Medium sized onsite car park just front of the hotel another convenient. £12 charge acceptable. 
On my arrival welcomed by friendly reception staff. I booked a room under the points and money reward scheme, cost me 12,000 points and £32.85. I requested for upgrades as per my diamond status, but unfortunately receptionist told all rooms are same, but as per my wish allocated a room at the top floor. 
My room number 520 with a view of the small park called Temple Gardens, just behind the hotel. As usual Hilton standard room is spotlessly clean. This hotel acquired by Hilton from Mint hotels with another 7 hotels in 2011 and after full refurbishment opened on April 2012. Still the room and the furnitures are kept in fine condition even after three years. Bathroom is average sized with a shower. All amenities provided. 
When Hilton took over these hotels from Mint, rooms installed with Apple iMac, instead of TV. (Hilton GN Birmingham, HGN Glasgow still got iMacs). Actually iMac screen is so small and it's not a replacement for a TV in a bedroom. I mentioned this to Hilton when I stayed those hotels, and they replied me near future they are considering to replace with TV sets. Here iMacs replaced with wall mounted TV sets. Thanks. 
I had my dinner and breakfast at the hotels restaurant City cafe. Breakfast is fine, but dinner also ok but the staff so exhausted and attending to arrange next day's breakfast even at 8.30pm! I wrote a separate review about this. 
Checkout done smoothly. Overall my stay at this hotel is fine. No complaints and nothing special also! Just a clean budget hotel stay!!"
1310,accipita,2015-12-31,4.0,"Pleasant room but oddly firm bed Hotel was reasonably priced compared to many others in the area and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the room we got for this price was. It was however a little on the small side and the few plug sockets were quite well hidden. If you receive the offer to upgrade to buy the room with a view, don't bother. While it is handily situated very close to Temple Meads it is surrounded by office blocks and the ""view"" is of a small uninteresting park. The bathroom was great and well stocked and our bed was very firm but I slept well so I shan't complain."
1311,NicolaR690,2015-12-31,4.0,Afternoon tea Bought the deal from groupon really fast service nice afternoon tea just no atmosphere in the room. Wouldn't go again as other places have nicer settings also didn't upgrade to the chrimbo wine as I don't like it good job too as the people behind did and we heard gagging hence to say they left it.needs some music or something.

Breakfast area is clean and satisfactiory selection of dishes/ drinks/ pastries etc was available.

On check in there was some confusion with the rooms but this was sorted out and the twin room I had booked into (which was cheaper than a double) was kindly changed to a double, which was more convenient for me. Staff were pleasant at breakfast and especially cheery when we ate in the hotel restaurant.

My room itself was pleasant, though perhaps just slightly too small for the furniture inside it (one large chair didn't seem to have any real place there) but this of course was not something that mattered. I enjoyed a decent night's sleep.

All in all, this hotel met my expectations and it is a good no-fuss place to stay for business."

1318,Nosage99,2015-12-31,4.0,"Fantastic central Bristol hotel This is a great hotel in a great vicinity, being close to Temple Meads station and the city centre. Very reasonably priced which included breakfast, which was self service but very good. Plenty of choice and the waiting/restaurant staff were superb. Totally attentive without being in your face, and cheerily efficient. The rooms are not luxury, but for what they are, they are very good. It was spotlessly clean, and the room had nice little touches that some other more expensive hotels lack, or you have to ask for. You get a full size fridge, which if you like a glass of wine after a hard day's sightseeing, you can buy one in advance from the nearby Tesco and it is nice and chilled when you are ready for it. There was an ironing board/iron and a hairdryer. There are plenty of mirrors, and more importantly, plug points near the mirrors so that you can see when you are styling your hair. So many hotels don't do this, you have to move furniture and unplug lamps, but not here. A large flat screen TV was welcome. The bathroom was a shower room, a bit cramped when you got out of the shower, but the actual shower was roomy and worked well. Hated the easy chair in the room - it was too cumbersome for the size of the room. The only Eason I did not give this a five score was the hard bed. I stayed 2 nights and by the second night I got a bit more acclimatised to it, but the day after the first night saw me with a sore hip and lower back pain, which is not something I normally suffer with. I would return, it ticked a lot of boxes. A well run and reasonably priced hotel in a prime location, what's not to like?"

The room was compact but clean with a good size TV. It overlooked a side street which was probably quieter that rooms overlooking the busy main road but we were still woken early by delivery vans. The bathroom was extremely small but the shower was hot and powerful. Breakfast was self service and we would have preferred fresh take and coffee rather than having to make our own! there was no green tea available which was a problem for me because it is all I drink. Having said that we were impressed with the selection on offer. The young man who cooked our poached eggs to order made an excellent job of it with a cheery smile, so that was a bonus!!  Overall the hotel delivers what it advertises, it is not somewhere with a wow factor but is businesslike and acceptable."

The rooms are on the compact side but are sufficient for two people. They are very clean and the Apple TV's are a nice touch. We didn't use the restaurant or bar so can't comment on these and we didn't stay for breakfast.

Staff very friendly and helpful, room very good and comfortable, breakfast staff especially good and a very nice room. No sense of being rushed even though we were nearer the closing time. Used Tesco vouchers to purchase the room and you need to secure the room first, so check availability, then apply for vouchers, they will only send via post and then you post of to Hilton Main office. They then confirm booking and you need confirmation to take with you. I only say this as you need to plan in advance and its best to send the application registered delivery. At least allow a fortnight from start to finish."

Very quickly booked in, cases up to room which was a twin and well equipped with storage facilities.   Very comfortable bed leading to good nights sleep.  Double glazing excellent, no noise from our second floor room facing front main road.  All clean, tidy, bathroom a little on small side but offset by a walk in shower which is always our choice.  Modern slimline LG tv good picture and numerous channels. No automatic slippers or bathrobes, which is not unusual for a four star hotel, although we have had them in a four star Hilton in Europe.
Breakfast, good variety of all the usual, ""Full English""  Egs cooked to order, Would have liked a porridge option.     Dinner, limited choice as a ""package"",  but never the less enough variety to please everyone including us who are vegetarians plus basic fish. Two choices of starters and two for desert..   One small suggestion, cards in front of the hot food containers so as to prevent the need to open all.

over all the hotel is a good quality hotel with friendly staff and is about a 10 -15 walk to the town center.
will stay here again"
1326,ErictheredPlymouth,2015-03-31,4.0,"Great Hotel. My wife and I went to see a show in Bristol and stayed in this hotel overnight whilst there.
Lovely evening meal and a lovely breakfast.
A tip for the breakfast all the same. Get your egg before getting the bacon, blackpudding, bread and coffee beacuse the lady who cooked it, took so long cooking it that everything went cold.
Apart from that, lovrely hotel.
Beware, you have to pay for your car parking."
1327,DavidLGardner,2015-11-30,2.0,"A misnamed hotel on the Bristol Inner Ring Road No garden, no Inn! A very functional and absolutely soulless hotel but with decent facilities -  proper tea and coffee and glasses rather than plastic beakers.  The shower room even had flannels.  It is a hotel built for the car with views one side of the cars whizzing around the inner ring road, and on the other side of a massive car park - despite only being a short walk from Temple Meads station.  Room was fine, if you like views of dual carriageways and traffic lights. Not exactly the best of Bristol as European Green Capital of 2015!"
1328,jonf197,2015-11-30,4.0,"Execellent weekend Spent a really special time here with family. Hotel so convenient to the city centre, breakfast was very good and the staff were really helpful. Rooms not the biggest but adequate. Our second year of staying here and would book again for next, if the deal including breakfast is still available."
1329,lexisantiago,2015-11-30,4.0,"Great staff! Been staying at this hotel a lot recently, it's always clean, food is pretty good and staff are great, especially the ones in the bar and restaurant. They are friendly, attentive and professional. Special mention to Maria in the restaurant-nothing is to much trouble for her, she is an asset to the hotel!"
1330,Dare1977,2015-11-30,5.0,"Perfect hotel, staff and location I stayed here last Saturday night with friends and couldn't have been happier with our choice of hotel. 
The hotel is in a perfect location. It's a very short taxi ride from the train station and in close proximity to the shops; literally a few minutes walk. Plenty of restaurants and pubs within walking distance and a short taxi ride to livelier bars and clubs.
 The hotel itself hasn't been open long and everything is clean and fresh and well maintained with excellent facilities. We booked this hotel at a very reasonable price for a city center hotel on a Saturday night.
 The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and they made sure we had an enjoyable stay. 
Our room was brilliant. We had a room on the top floor which was modern and spacious and had everything we needed such as shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and moisturiser in the bathroom, iron and ironing board, kettle, air-conditioning and heating, comfy beds, black out curtains and free wifi. Breakfast was served up until 11am and was delicious.
An absolutely perfect stay. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitelybook again next time I'm in Bristol."
1331,Jodo78,2015-08-31,3.0,"Nice Hotel but too Hot Good hotel and would recommend as long as you don't mind hot rooms, stopped over late August bank holiday, despite it being cool and rainy outside the rooms were too hot, not convinced the air-con actually did anything.

Bad point out of the way, the hotel is in a great location, 2 minute walk from the train station and 10 minutes from the main nightlife and harbour-side area. Local convenience store back towards the train station (just before Weatherspoons). Head towards the harbour-side for a Tesco express, Subway etc.

A comfy bar area with sky sports was ideal for a few beers while catching up with the sport. A very good outside area for food or drinks, it was ideal for evening drinks before leaving the hotel for the harbour-side.

Friendly staff and good service, as expected from the Hilton chain.

Rooms were compact but as we were out (or in the bar) most of the time no real issue.

Breakfast was excellent, coffee and tea self service and hot food choice really good, nice pastries as well. Didn't use but there are vending machines for snacks 24 hours (hot and cold).

I would recommend the hotel for exploring Bristol and would stop again (hopefully though the rooms would not be so hot)."

I stayed two nights and suffered greatly for it, the beds here are uncomfortably hard. Don't get me wrong I like a firm mattress, but this was the worst sleep I've ever had in any hotel. Its located in a good part of the city centre, with easy links to all public transport, the breakfast here was great, and the staff were all lovely."
1334,PUTNEYBIKER,2015-11-30,4.0,"Convenient, clean, and cheerful crew Great welcome on reception which was the case with restaurant staff and housekeeping. Really positive and that is so important when all these genre of hotels are selling similar services. Bugbear 1 Minuscule shower room.  2. Processed orange juice. 3. No Coffee machine or selection at breakfast. Breakfast was pretty generous and should offer most something to start the day  well nourished. Had a chicken Caesar salad one for snack lunch, all the ingredients were there bit not much of a success. Someone tried to add some items to my bill from the mini shop so keep an eye on your pro forma invoice. Parking potentially tight but there is a pay and display just to rear. Oh yes, a blanket would be nice, had to press towels into use to keep warm. Keep up the good work"

First time here but we have visited other Hilton hotel restaurants. Booked the date online using 'Bookatable' and had no problem. My coeliac diet requirement was relayed to the Hotel before our arrival and there were no problems.
The meal was excellent the staff superb and the whole evening was a joy.
I am very happy to recommend this restaurant. We liked our visit, many thanks"
1336,Ac4js,2015-11-30,4.0,Good hotel. Nice rooms and very clean This is a nice hotel in a good location. Very close to temple meads train station. The staff here are very friendly and helpful. I would have gave this 5 stars but I didn't as I had to pay £12 for parking which you would have thought would have been included with your hotel stay. Also it's an extra £11 for breakfast in the morning. Which I would have also thought would have been included in the price too. When you pay £125 for a nights stay!!!
1337,JennyBideford,2015-11-30,4.0,Very small bathroom. Good central location.. we had garden view room which was at front of hotel. Room was clean and alittle smaller than expected. The bathroom was very tiny  and after a shower you would find it easier to come out and dry yourself.. we had evening meal which was excellent ..breakfast was good but would have liked hot plates.. air conditioning was very noisey but needed it as room was very hot.. parking very restricted. Overall for what we paid was very good.
1338,MonicaP650,2015-11-30,5.0,"Three happy days! This was our first stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and were not sure what to expect, however the Hilton Garden Hotel in Bristol proved wonderful! Everything about it is excellent, Although next to a dual carriageway, the hotel was quiet and the surroundings pleasant with a small park opposite. The staff (international) are friendly and very helpful - no request was too difficult for them.  The rooms were comfortable and, for a disabled resident, extremely well appointed.  The food was also very good;all in all, there is nothing which I would want to amend."
1339,C5179NMmichaelk,2015-11-30,3.0,JT Stag Do We booked this stag weekend well in advance so we got a decent deal of £88/ room for 2 nights with breakfast. The hotel was ok. I wouldn't say it is any better than any premier inn I have stayed at. I suppose we never made full use of the facilities just the bar and considering we were on a stag weekend we spent quite a bit of our time and money at the bar. We were told to keep the noise down on a number of occasions obviously from a couple of complaints so we didn't hang around the bar for too long.
1340,GemmaK1984,2015-10-31,5.0,"Great hotel :) We stayed at ‘The Hilton Garden Inn’ during our recent visit to Bristol. We were welcomed by the receptionist and given key cards to our room and explained when breakfast would be and the opening times of the bar. 

Check Inn: When we arrived at 10.30am our room was not ready, so we parked up and came back at 2pm to check inn. The check in was smooth. 

Rooms: We had a queen room with a garden view; the room was well sized and very clean. They have great faculties such as tea/ coffee, shower, bath, hairdryer, iron and board. My only grumble would be that there was no hand wash in the bathroom for you to wash your hands, just soap. However, there was a selection of shampoo, conditioner and body wash, which was complimentary. 

Breakfast: The breakfast selection is excellent whether you want cold or something hot. There was an excellent selection of cooked, continental. You have to make your own tea and coffee. I thoroughly enjoyed the waffles on my final morning. 

Bar: There is a bar area at the hotel, unfortunately we tried to have a drink here but the cocktails were not made well at all and we had to complain about them. Therefore, we chose not to drink in the bar area again. 

Wi-Fi: The Wi-Fi was very poor!

Overall: A great stay. The hotel is very close to the city centre, just a short walk to the shops, restaurants and bars. I would definitely recommend the hotel and plan to stay again in the near future. We even stayed an extra night due to loving Bristol so much… 

Room Tip: We stayed in room 228."

This took away the ease and comfort of room service. I rung the front desk and they sorted it out for me, i paid for it when I left as it should be done. I was very close to losing it with incompetent room service staff."

1343,Y7247HStracyt,2015-10-31,2.0,"Not much bettter than Travelodge. There are no iMacs in the rooms, even though the room information books and online advertising says there are. Our garden view was actually a tree through a cracked window. The bed was so hard we had backache. The room was quite small and certainly not like in the publicity pictures. Also the wifi is so slow it's pretty impossible to do anything online. On the plus side it was clean and quiet and the staff seemed nice. But all in all I would never stay at this hotel again. It was not good value for money at all and it was not an enjoyable experience staying there."

We had a room at the back of the hotel which looked over a lovely little park. We found the staff welcoming, helpful and friendly. Both the room and the public areas were spotlessly clean and modern.  The breakfast was a serve your self hot and cold buffet, there was plenty of choice and again nothing was too much trouble for the staff."

I really would recommend it to everyone.
1349,BigTed57,2015-10-31,5.0,"Lovely weekend break Unusually for Bristol's central hotels we managed to grab a bargain weekend stay for only £102/night (inclusive of breakfast). Arrived at 18.15pm on the Friday night and was pleasantly surprised to find parking spaces. Check-in was handled efficiently and we were given a 5th floor room. Rooms are small, particularly the bathroom(shower only), but they are finished to a very high standard. Only a 10 min walk to the main shopping area's and loads of bars and restaurants within easy reach. Highly recommended."

After some confusion at the beginning as to wether we where entitled to some form of voucher or not, our tea arrived carefully displayed and well laid out.   The sandwiches where tasty but fairly standard.  The scones freshly baked with plenty of cream and jam.  It was my wife's birthday and this was celebrated with a modern twist on a birthday cake.  Towards the end our grand daughter wanted some more of the delicious strawberries and the staff went the extra mile creating a stunning sweet especially for her. All in all a great afternoon."

The staff were very helpful, we had ordered potato wedges at the bar, there was a slight delay on their behalf and they brought an extra large bowl as way of compensation.
At breakfast I was assisted by a member of staff at the breakfast buffet as I am blind, whilst my wife was able to get her own breakfast, enabling us to eat together, something I am very appreciative of.
Checkout was very simple and straightforward. Will definitely be staying again."

The WiFi was a bit on and off and the room keys kept deactivating which was pretty annoying! Also was woke up by a fire alarm going off before 8am on a Sunday morning!
On the plus side the free Cookies were a nice touch and was only a ten minute walk to the harbour side and 5mins from Bristol Temple Meads."

It is relatively well located for the city centre, easily walkable and is also close to Temple Meads station. I didn't eat at the hotel but the restaurant looked quite busy with a good atmosphere. I would stay here again if the need arose."

Tiny room & bathroom feeling very cramped, couldn't open wardrobe door as chair too close & no room to move it to. Tv & TV guide didn't work so I called main desk & was told someone would call me back, nobody did. Very noisy room with constant traffic. Nobody cleaned my room or topped up toiletries/tea etc in a 48 HR stay. Toilet rol cheap and wouldn't stay on roll holder which was wonky. Mouldy in shower tray.

Yummy and all very fresh"

Recent trip room was uncomfortably hot, air con noisy and not very effective and switched off after a short time so so kept waking up far too hot.  Couldn't open the  window as although I'd asked for a quiet room I was given one facing the busy road.  Noisy creaky bed was rock hard.  I like a firm mattress but this was ridiculous.  Previous Apple media replaced with a large wall mounted TV which can't be angled to view from desk/chair.  Dreadful Muzak playing outside rear door so no point in trying to go outside from the noisy bar to make a phone call.  I used to enjoy staying here, but there are other similar priced hotels nearby which offer bigger rooms and a decent night's sleep."

My mom, her sister and my moms partner went without a starter or a main meal. All the staff at the restaurant dont communicate with each other.

The hotel was very easy to find. Onsite parking (although not that many spaces on a first come first serve basis. We didn't have a problem and we arrived with friends with two cars. Our other friends came by train and this is an excellent location for this because its only five mins from the train station) the rooms are not massive but perfectly adequate. Good in room facilities. Fairly comfortable bed. Bathroom a little small. The only drawback I could find is that the room got quite hot and the window only opened about an inch. The staff were all friendly and helpful especially the Hungarian barman who was a star, especially when faced with eight people all wanting many rounds of cocktails (yum) all in all a good and happy stay."
1363,avirips,2015-09-30,5.0,"A Welcome Return It's been some months since I last stayed here and previous visits were all first class experiences. I'm very happy to report that, if anything, the Garden is even greener than before!

You guys really do put the Double Tree second. Superb customer service, great food with some novel presentation too. Comfortable and well appointed rooms that still have a biscuit with the tea and coffee in the room, lovely little touch. Loving the huge screen TV, that's much better! A better selection of fine wines to compliment a well thought out menu which does represent really good value. A beautifully prepared and presented buffet breakfast still offering something for everyone. What's not to like?

Nothing that I can think of other than some may find the rooms a little on the small side and I don't really need two chairs -which would create more floor space.

I do like the fact that you can put clothes and personal items in to drawers and cupboard space you can close, I'm not a fan of this open plan nonsense that you find in Premier and Travelodge. And this Hilton Garden has the cleanest bathrooms and best design of user friendly shower of any hotel I have ever used!

So, my hotel of choice, still, and I have tried them all. Well done guys! 

I'll be back..........."

What I didn`t expect was that I had to put coins in the clients washing machine which at the time I wanted to use was washing hotel`s white towells. It`s a costumer`s washing machine or not?
For the price I paid for the room I expect at least to have my laundry done for free and have acces to a washing machine at all times.
Very embarrasing having to pop up and down and wait one hour to wash my OH`s stuff.

1366,jonathankmorgan,2015-09-30,3.0,"Adequate comfort very expensive  We booked to stay here to watch a gig in Clifton. 

The location is a good spot for shopping and just about walking distance to the older city of Bristol, but could be deceiving if you haven't visited before and you could end up having to get a taxi...

Upon arriving our room wasn't ready so we headed out for an afternoon in Bristol, on foot, and found ourselves in the middle of a business district rather than Bristol city centre, we were about 10minute stroll from where we needed to be.

Arriving back our room was ready and we have a great view over the garden, worth requesting as the other side faces a busy dual carriageway.

The room was clean, the bed is tiny, I'm 6ft and my feet hung over the end. The TV didn't have freeview working efficiently but this was something that didn't bother us. There isn't bottled water in the rooms so be prepared to tap it, or head down and buy some in reception. 

The bathroom was clean and well maintained. 

We had a late lunch/ snack at our room and that was great, same with the drinks very reasonable pricing on beers and wine.

Good Points 

Clean 
Tidy
Friendly Staff
Good Pricing on Beverages 

Bad Points 

At £149 for a double room then paying £25 for breakfast, and a further £12 to park I thought it was very expensive for what it is, the rooms are smaller as is the bed and much less comfortable of those such as Premier Inn etc 

It was disappointingly basic for the price, and I'd stay in a Premier Inn over this hotel again if I had the choice, or for £200 I'd chose a different hotel"

Parking is limited. They advise you to park in the municipal car park next door. Great! But beware they don't emphasis the fact that if you're not out there at 8am to put a new ticket on you will get a fine. We saw about 6 cars on Sunday morning all with tickets. More care please.

Not a great place at weekends as this is stag and hen hotel central. Lots of loud, drunk people in the bar and next morning at breakfast. I wouldn't mind but once you've seen one inflatable pen!s you've seen them all.

Seemed like acool idea to put Mac computers in all the rooms (doubles as TV) but the Mac remote is not very reliable and was a constant frustration.

Buffet breakfast was really good and would have been enjoyable had it not been for the large swathes of still drunk hens/stags constantly going in and out for ""quick fags"""

1375,nancledra53,2015-08-31,4.0,"Served it's purpose well Only a couple of nights at the Double tree, but everything was fine. Well up to the standards expected from the lower rate Hiltons, (Doubletree/Garden Inns) Close to the station at Temple Meads, ( a bit of a hike for the elderly with baggage, special needs, and a bit too close for the cost of a taxi), and not too far from the City Centre. A bus stop outside the hotel is very useful, especially for getting up to Clifton, (and back). Facilities basic but everything you need. There were two restaurants we wanted to try in Bristol so we didn't eat there at the hotel. Staff as always at the Hilton, friendly, helpful, and efficient. If I was to return to Bristol, I'd definitely stay at the Garden Inn.

One small thing. Just down the road is the Hilton Doubletree. Very close to the Garden Inn. 10PM on our second night someone was trying to enter the room. We looked through the spyhole in the door, and saw someone looking very confused. When I opened the door it transpired that he had the same room number at the Doubletree and had mistaken the entrance to the hotel. It was laughed off and with good humour. Perhaps clearer signage for the hotels and some kind of warning at entrances? Just an idea."

Overall, I enjoyed my stay but there were one or two things that seemed out of place for a pretty expensive hotel.  The breakfasts on offer are actually better during the week than at the weekend.  During the week, an additional menu of five or so items is available of about five items, which can be freshly prepared for you, these items include kippers and omelettes but the menu is not available at the weekend.  Although, I have to say that the buffet itself is pretty extensive and will suit most tastes, it just seems an odd omission.  Also the cleaning of the rooms is pretty erratic.  On Sunday afternoon, I returned to my room and 5.30 pm and the cleaners had just used bleach in my room and were finishing up the cleaning.  I will add that the cleaning and housekeeping was always well done but there did not seem to be any consistence concerning the time that the cleaning was completed.  Normally, with most hotels, there seems to be a cut off point at about 2pm or 3pm, so that I guess the guests can go back to their room and have a shower before dinner.  The Reception staff were nice.

I found my stay in the hotel okay but not exceptional.  For some reason, I expected more."
1377,CurdworthColt,2015-06-30,4.0,"A good experience We were a little early on arrival and our room was not quite ready. No problem, the very pleasant and welcoming reception staff noted my mobile number and called when housekeeping   were finished, this allowed us time to stroll into the city centre and have a look around.
Our room was very much in the old City Inn style, including Apple Mac, with a few updates. We enjoyed the view from the room which overlooked the small park at the rear of the hotel and thought it possibly quieter than rooms at the front. Room was very clean with all the little touches we expected i.e. good toiletries and proper glasses.
Breakfast we thought was excellent. All buffet, self-service, including tea and coffee but everything fresh and good quality.
All in all a very good hotel in an excellent location which we would highly recommend."
1378,syamashi,2015-09-30,4.0,"Well located, great for business trips I have been staying there for a few weeks now, and amongst all options in the city, I selected this for the Hilton Honors points, really. But I continued to stay, because it is clean, comfortable and has free parking (at a car park outside of hotel, from 18.00 to 8.00). I agree with other guests, rooms are quite small, but I'm a small person myself, so it bothers me a little, not much. Room service is great, nice staff and good breakfast."

The hotel is in a quiet area, 15 minutes walk from the city center. A taxi to airport will cost 25 euros, although there is airport bus stop not too far by walk. Building and room look very modern. Room size is pretty small for 2 people. We had to leave at 6AM, so could not have breakfast. Staff was friendly and efficient both at check-in and check-out.

The hotel is located very near to the city centre attractions (about 5 mins walk to the Quayside and to Temple Meads station) and has a bus stop right outside if you need to travel further. 

The rate was very reasonable (about £85 per night including breakfast) and we would certainly stop here again!"

The restaurant serves an excellent breakfast and the staff were attentive without being intrusive.
1388,Keyesdotcom,2015-08-31,4.0,"Excellent Hotel Stayed for two nights, check-in/out was quick and hassle free.

We stayed on the fourth floor, room was a decent size, lovely shower, Apple Mac installed in the room as TV/computer facility and the bed was massive, very impressed with how comfy it was! Found it strange that the windows didn't open but our air-con was working fine - without it, the room would've been sweltering. Breakfast came with the price of the room and they have a really good selection.

The hotel itself is backed up onto a garden that leads to an old church ruin, very scenic and it's a 10 minute walk from either Cabot Circus and the Harbour. It's also across the road from Temple Meads train station."
1389,128jaclyn,2015-08-31,2.0,"Far too hot Room was far too hot. Air conditioning awful and with only a small window to open it was a difficult night. They did provide a fan however, which helped a little but, there was no offer to change rooms.   The hotel also plays the most awful B rated music in the hallway first thing in the morning . Not a good stay ."
1390,Bimbob,2015-08-31,4.0,"Very good location Good location, only a short walk into town. The hotel is welcoming, comfortable, modern and very clean. The breakfast was lovely, everything being available from fresh fruit,pastries to full english. . We sat in the bar area where it was a lot cooler. (Other reviews said the breakfast room was too warm. ) The only downside was the air con not working efficientlly and being noisy which made it very difficult to sleep. We were given a fan but these just re circulate the warm air. This problem was dealt with and resolved professionally by the manageress to our satisfaction."
1391,1947Jackie,2015-08-31,5.0,"Excellent hotel stayed here for an overnight stay on bed breakfast and evening meal, with GB Tours. It's a lovely hotel, bedrooms spotlessly clean and really comfortable. Tea and coffee making facilities, even a choice of tea! Tried the earl grey, but sorry to say I prefer a good old fashioned English cuppa. Wifi throughout the hotel. Complimentary shampoos etc which were really nice quality. Really large towels in the bathroom, also clean and comfy beds and pillows.  There was a small fridge and a safe In the room too.
Evening meal - good choice, three courses. Had to queue for each course and it was self serve but all very nice and hot.
Breakfast also very nice and plenty of it. 
We were with a coach party so I suppose that's why we had to queue for the evening meal. It was a 'set time' for us. Breakfast was from early until after 9a.m hence - less of a wait. 
Staff were very nice, friendly too. 
Really enjoyed our short stay and would certainly recommend the hotel."
1392,Eddoh,2015-08-31,5.0,"Clean, comfortable and above standard Really great hotel, close to the station and harbor area of Bristol and within easy walk of Cabot Circus and the main shopping area. Great location. 

The hotel itself is modern and our room a decent size with a comfortable bed and iMac in the room which doubles as computer and TV. There's also free wifi which actually works and made our stay that little bit extra easier. 

One thing I will say is that the car park gets really busy and if its too full, cars park all along the front side of the hotel. We found it really difficult to get our car out the space due to the other cars in the car park. 

But otherwise, a great place."

1394,lovedourholiday,2015-08-31,4.0,"Girly stay Stayed with two friends for our annual 'girls out' trip for shopping and sightseeing with dinner and few drinks.
This hotel is very convenient to Temple Mead Station and Cabot Shopping Centre.....both just a short walk away.  We had lovely rooms with a double bed, Apple Mac  computer/tv, more than sufficient tea, coffee and milk (makes a change not to have to keep asking for more) and good quality toiletries....conditioner too.  Very comfortable bed. As part of the deal offered, we had a three course dinner which was delicious, great varied menu....sat over dinner for 2 hours and no one asked us to move.  Two for one cocktails are a bargain too!!   Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice for cereal, fruit, yoghurts, cooked food and tasty pastries.  All in all a lovely time away with special friends.  
The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is because the room was stuffy, the window doesn't open very wide and the air con was quite noisy (for me) and the hair dryer is poor quality.....either burns your scalp or is cold, a decent hair dryer doesn't cost much. 
We're looking forward to next years trip to Manchester and will definitely go Hilton!!"
1395,X9004DXmarkc,2015-08-31,3.0,"Clean and comfortable...but boiling The hotel was clean and friendly and comfortable.  My only complaint is that the air con was about as powerful as a fart in a hurricane.  I woke up at 1am and the room for far too hot even with the air con set to manual and the coldest setting.  It made the nights sleep very broken and uncomfortable.  Sleepily fumbling around to find the window at 2am and my mate waking to see me in my pants near his bed, was not the ideal situation to be in.  The blood drained from his face, a deadly silence fell on the room and for a brief moment, our friendship died.

anyway, overall it was good."
1396,Gmfa,2015-08-31,4.0,"Good Stay but £12 for overnight parking?  I booked this hotel through my booking agent and paid a very reasonable £95 for B and B.

Arrived late at night and was checked in swiftly by 2 very polite and helpful front desk team members.

Room was good quality, bed comfortable, everything worked in the room and was very clean and tidy. Aircon if you leave it on can be noisy so had to get up through the night and turn it off but not a big issue really.

Breakfast was very relaxing and the food was very good. Plenty of choice and it was a help yourself style of service.

All in all a great stay however just one thing took the edge of my stay, a £12 parking charge that I wasn't expecting.

My invoice came through the door and when I looked at it I was surprised to see the charge.

My booking agent didn't mention it and nor was it mentioned when I checked in.

I suppose most hotels charge something for parking now and either hide it in the room rate or charge separately but £12? Really that much for an overnight stay when I have paid for my room and food and drink in the bar?

I think if I had been told I would have been prepared and even a small charge of £3 to £5 would have been more palatable.

This may be the normal charge around Bristol city centre but I hope the team at HGI Bristol City Centre review their charging structure."

Also the breakfast did not disappoint and there was plenty to choose from. We would definitely stay here again.

The room was clean and comfortable with an ;-)'s, ours had a view over the park, very nice.

Breakfast was very very good but does finish at 10am. We also ate in the bar last night which was lovely as well.

The staff are fabulous and friendly.

We stayed here on purpose as we were visiting to do the Shaun the Sheep trails, this was a massive hit but a bit exhausting. 

We will definitely be back because we didn't get chance to do the normal touristy things we would have done.

Thanks to all for a very enjoyable stay."
1401,Superem123,2015-08-31,5.0,"A peaceful stay for a hotel in the main road  I recently stayed here for work, the car park is limited for the number of rooms and be aware if you park under the trees the sap will cover your car overnight, luckily for me it rained the next day! Hotel is functional with a small bar area you can sit outside and a restaurant, there is also a convenience section for you to choose a ready meal and cook it. The location of the hotel is central a stroll through the park and your minutes from the waterside. 
The rooms are clean and tidy and have all you need for your stay, with iMacs for the TV and Internet use. Wifi is free in the hotel and a good service. Would return again thank you"
1402,DIF1891,2015-08-31,4.0,"Near the train station The hotel is near the train station but not so close so the trains disturb your sleep. We tried to check in at 15:15 but the room wasn't ready, we had to wait 30 minutes for the room. Nice staff at the reception.  The room was nice but it got pretty warm at night.

1406,verticalforest,2015-08-31,3.0,"Disappointing I stayed for 3 nights and the overall experience was a bit underwhelming. 

The room itself was small but comfortable however I could not sleep very well due to a continuous noise from behind the wall. I was told at the reception that if this was not air conditioning (which it wasn't) they could not do anything, which was quite disappointing given the level of service one would expect from Hilton...
Also, there were no biscuits provided in the rooms (I know, everyone is going healthy these days but I love my hotel biscuits!) and the hot chocolate was only replaced 2 days after I drank it. Only 1 herbal teabag was provided. On the third morning, I discovered that the shampoo provided, which was half-used and which I was planning to use that morning, had been removed and not replaced! Luckily I had my own to use but this was an unpleasant surprise.

The breakfast was OK but I found the choice rather limited, particularly with my egg intolerance...

On the other hand, the location is fantastic, 5min walk from Temple Meads station and the city centre, and no noise from the street bothered me at any point even though my windows faced that way. 

All in all, an average stay for a high price - will choose a different hotel next time."
1407,EmAnt1204,2015-08-31,4.0,"One night stay at the Garden Inn We found this hotel to be brilliant- just what we needed for a one night stay in Bristol. We travelled to Bristol early on a Saturday morning because we were heading to a friends wedding and the hotel staff kindly let us into our room early to get ready for the wedding. This was SO helpful because otherwise we would've been getting changed in the car or a loo somewhere!
When the wedding had finished, the Garden Inn provided a great place to stay, comfy bed, nice room, perfect for what we were after. Also, the breakfast in the morning was AMAZING, the waffles were so good!"

The staff were all extremely helpful and efficient but just as importantly all had a smile on their face. The room was adequate for our 4 night stay but would benefit from extra drawer space. It was clean, tidy and quiet and we enjoyed our short stay. Did not use the restaurant so cannot comment on the food."

Friendly reception. My room was smaller than expected but well equipped. Apart from the hospitality tray. I've stayed in hotels of this standard that supplied real coffee, hot chocolate and nice quality biscuits. Not so at this hotel.
My shower was cold on the first morning, even though I ran it for a quite while it was freezing and only just slightly warmer on the second day but better in the evenings.
Nice quiet hotel at night even though my room was on the car park and main road side.
The best thing about my stay was the breakfast it was fabulous and the staff were very friendly. Everything was fresh and hot with my poached eggs cooked to order in front of me. Can't get fresher than that! Lots to choose from and self service."

My only reservations was the small and narrow car park, where indeed once you drive in to find out it is full, one has to reverse all the way out, as well as the overall price which seemed very high."

Woken at 3.30 Sunday am by other noisy guests but that can happen anywhere. Complimentary cakes on reception and all staff we met very friendly and helpful. Good breakfast buffet selection with tasty sausages etc. Didn't eat dinner in the restaurant but had a bar snack and could choose from restaurant or bar snack menu. Good food, nicely served. There is also a ""pantry"" by reception where you can buy and reheat ready meals. Useful for children or adults wanting a quick meal. I think there is also a guest laundry room which is an unusual plus. Only 5 minutes max walk to train station if you leave the station by the side door not the main ramp."

Tv remote was broken but was told they couldn't do anything so we should basically just live with it.

Used as a base for a trip to Bath as I booked late and all the reasonably priced Bath places were booked out. 

Key points;
- Close to Bristol Temple Meads station (walking distance)
- 10 mins or so walk into central Bristol
- Immediate area is drab, a busy road, office buildings with not many shops
- Perfectly functional rooms but nothing special
- The fish at the restaurant was actually far better than I expected

Nothing wrong with the hotel and it was more or less what I expected for the price. 

Not suitable for a romantic stay."

The gym isn't huge but has enough equipment and it wasn't busy when I visited.

The hotel is central, clean and our room had a lovely view of a park and plc church. 

The room had everything you need but I would say the bathroom was small ... as were the free toiletries. 

The staff were friendly and helpful. 

My only real criticism would be the noise on the restaurant at breakfast. There is music playing that you can't really hear but it is loud enough to sound like a constant hum. And the chairs make a racket when people move them.  Both of these could be easily sorted. 

I'd stay again."

1432,Smudge43,2015-07-31,4.0,"Great location for the City Centre, good hotel. Having stayed in numerous Hilton Group hotels you now what to expect. The room sizes are generally good, on this occasion mine (216) overlooked Temple Church and gardens park. As it's at the back of the hotel I didn't hear any road noise at all. 

The room was pleasant, bright and clean so all good. At the Garden Inn they have Apple iMac TV/PC's in the rooms which are good. They can take a bit of getting used to if you've never used one before but decent enough.  WIFI is also complimentary throughout the hotel. The rest of the room amenities are as you'd expect and a good standard. The bathroom was a little ""compact"" but clean enough so again no complaints.

I used the fitness center which was fairly small but all the equipment looked in good order and was fine. 

The City Café Restaurant food was good. I had the Black pudding, pancetta & pea puree to start followed by the Chicken Supreme. I was impressed by the quality of the food and the staff in all honesty. Everything was cooked really well and the price very reasonable. 

Breakfast was the traditional buffet style but again the food was well cooked and well presented. As I sat and ate my breakfast the chef came out and changed the food a couple of times, for me that's always a good sign as very often food is left out and dries up or gets covered in water from the dome lids they use.

Overnight parking is a hefty £12.00, in most hotels these days this is free for residents although I guess that's what you get in a City center with limited space.

Overall a good stay and I would go back."
1433,Locket78,2015-07-31,3.0,"Average.... I stayed here for 1 night whilst on business. I have stayed in many Hilton hotels so was expecting this short trip to pleasant and comfortable. 

Check in:
Check in was ok, but the lady on reception was a little abrupt when I refused to leave my card details for extras. I never do this and always pay as I go. Never had any issues with this in other hotels. But she most definitely seemed a bit annoyed when I politely declined. 

Room:
I was in room 216 which was very small for a double but nicely decorated, modern and clean. The TV is apple and took a fair amount of tinkering with to simply put the TV on. I have an iPhone and iPad and I still struggled to figure out what to do for a while! 
 
Restaurant:
The service was extremely slow and I was the only person in there for the first 30 mins. The waiter didn't know what the soup was and had to run off to ask. I was sat waiting for my drink and menu for a while. I ordered a mushroom and leek tart to start which was very nice but it all went downhill from there... The main was awful. I ordered the sirloin steak (£6.95 supplement) which was served with chips, tomato, mushroom and watercress with a peppercorn sauce. I asked for my steak medium-well and it arrived rare. Blood was spilling onto the plate when I cut into it and it was a really fatty grisly piece of steak. The chips were most definitely frozen and still a bit hard in the middle, then the peppercorn sauce was really watery and lacked flavour. It all mixed in with the blood on the plate which looked awful. For desert I had my eye on the apple tart-tatin served with ice cream. I placed the order and again waited a while. Another waiter came over and asked me if I wanted to order so I told him that i had placed order but it hadn't arrived yet. When it did arrive it was not at all what I was expecting! It was a slice of cold apple tart served with berry coulis and what seemed like squirty cream from a can! So I ate some of it but by this point I'd had enough. 2 minutes later the other waiter arrived with an apple tart-tatin with the ice cream that I had asked for!!! The waiters seem very confused and don't seem to understand the menu or what customers ask for. 
Breakfast was not much better, I was greeted by a waitress who lead me to a table and disappeared never to return. She didn't explain to me that everything was self service (including tea and coffee) or offer to get me tea or coffee, so I sat for a while waiting to order drinks then noticed the hot water and coffee station beside the door. The food at breakfast was ok, nothing special. The staff at this hotel could do with some customer service training so that they deliver the kind of service expected at a Hilton hotel. 
I would not stay here again."
1434,WalesHappydaze,2015-07-31,3.0,"Prefer a Premier Inn First time staying at a Hilton and although the room was nice it wasn't anything special, just average. The aircon was a waste of time - was set on a timer so kept switching off throughout the night and the room was very hot. The aircon was noisy and to be honest not that cold anyway. The bed was extremely hard but the pillows were perfect. Overall for the price we paid it didn't exceed any expectations, I have stayed in many Premier inns and have to say I prefer them, the quality and standard is just as good if not better and the price can be very good if you get a saver rate. If had the choice in future I would definitely opt for a different chain rather than the Hilton. You are basically just paying for the name in my opinion. There was also a query with regards to my bill, I booked via booking.com and on arrival the receptionist asked for my card to verify, after checking my pending transactions I noticed that they had added an extra £26 to cover any ""extra"" costs and when I asked why they said it will be refunded but could take a few days, in meantime this did affect my available balance, bit of a bummer if on a budget weekend and needed that little bit of cash."
1435,A7139TZkyler,2015-03-31,5.0,Amazing Stay! Great Staff & Location! Booked for a couple of nights to go shopping in Bristol! Great hotel and the staff were so friendly. Having a Mac in the room was fun when getting ready to go out. Overall very comfy stay. Will be back!
1436,J0C22,2015-06-30,5.0,"Great Location Great Location for access to city centre and nightlife, easy walking distance to Cabots Circus and the Harbourside areas.  Modern hotel with all the expected amenities and a good quality feel.  Room on the small side but perfectly adequate for overnight stay."
1437,mrscoulter,2015-07-31,5.0,"Helpful and friendly staff We stayed at this hotel on Friday evening to visit our son who has recently moved to Bristol. As Hilton Honors members we often choose this chain in hotel centres. 

When we arrived the car park was almost full but we managed to find a space. The receptionist gave us a warm welcome and allocated a room on the 5th floor overlooking the small park at rear of hotel. As we headed off to the lift I commented to my husband how she had excellent customer service skills. I appreciate the balance of helpful, friendly and efficient. 

Yes the room was small but very clean and well equipped with everything we needed including an iron and ironing board. When out and about in the city we just want somewhere clean and comfortable to come back to. 

The bar, restaurant and outside area were fine and again the waiting staff were lovely especially the lady with red hair who suggested 'a nice chilled glass of Prosecco' to revive me after my day out! 

We enjoyed breakfast, it's self service even for tea and coffee, no problem and all the usual choices plus there is a waffle machine and a chatty lady cooking the eggs to order.

It was £12 to park the car and we think that is acceptable for a city centre. The sun shone and Bristol was buzzing with several events on including the Shaun the Sheep trail. Overall very happy with this hotel, a big tick for customer service and yes we will return."
1438,JimmyK323,2015-06-30,5.0,"First Class Stay. I have stayed at this hotel on five separate occasions and it never fails to deliver. Great rooms with everything you need, nice restaurant, with a good selection of meals and the breakfast is absolutely spot-on. Of course, all this cannot be achieved without  having the right staff. The Hilton Garden has it all."
1439,616sheenaa,2015-07-31,5.0,Friendly helpful staff Stayed 3 nights here visiting family. Our accessable room was perfect and the wet room was ideal. Perfectly placed hotel to visit all city centre attractions and walkable. Restaurant is friendly and the food excellent.

The rooms are a little small but the bar and restaurant including the outdoor space are nice and the breakfast was good.  Parking outside is a bit limited but I managed both days so not an issue.  It's in a good location and all in good value for money,"

The service is good and the hotel is clean and very functional. the service is OK but you may need to queue to check on or out. The buffet breakfast offered was good and the choice and quality OK. Space was limited and it was quite noisy. I think that next time round I would find somewhere a little further out save the money and use a taxi as this place is too cramped with space being at too high a premium. Car parking, well there are a limited number of places so good luck finding one. Disappointing"
1442,NWills_1982,2015-07-31,3.0,"Nice hotel The staff were friendly, breakfast was lovely and the rooms were clean and spacious (as spacious as possible with two girls getting ready in it) the only down side was the rooms were really hot! Couldn't get the air conditioning to work so we had the tiny windows open a fraction. Which was fine apart from at 7am workmen started digging up the roads outside and the noise was horrendous!! I live on a main road so car traffic doesn't bother me but that noise kept us awake. If I was staying again is definitely ask for a room at the back!"

The hotel is new and clean and is a good price for Bristol which can be expensive at times. The breakfast was what you would expect from this chain of hotels and breakfast staff actually talked to you which was a nice surprise , and the rooms and beds good . The TV is built in to a Apple Mac and was easy. Desk staff very good and helpful and gave is a great map of the city. The hotel is opposite a small park , walk through and it leads to the lovely positioned Brew Dog by the river. Yes , would stop there again."

1446,EmMc21,2015-06-30,5.0,Would highly reccomend Stayed recently with a hen party and we had dinner and breakfast included on both days. the breakfast was amazing we didnt stop raving about it the entire time! so many choices including waffles and nutella! (Total children!) dinner was beautiful both nights with great staff serving us. the rooms are compact and so clean and modern. I think it was pretty central too within walking distance of the shops. coming in after a night out to the little shop in the lobby which sells snacks and everything you could think of was a novelty too. Great stay!

Stayed in room 514 which was great and had air conditioning which was definitely needed, as it was really hot weather! We had breakfast on both mornings and it was delicious, especially the sausages! Staff all friendly particularly the lady who makes the eggs at breakfast and the blonde waitress who delivered our room service! My boyfriend also organised for chocolate, champagne and rose petals to be in our room when we arrived which was lovely, so thank you to the lady who helped him (Marta?). 
The hotel is in a good position to walk into Bristol, Cabot circus is literally a 5 minute walk!
Great place to stay if you want to explore Bristol and the surrounding area!"

1450,eo227,2015-06-30,4.0,"Solid Hotel Comfortable hotel located close to Temple Quay and Temple Meads. Have stayed here several times over the past few years and the service is generally pretty good. Small fitness room on site, bar, and restaurant as well. Rooms are probably on the small size, but beds are comfortable and imacs in the room have wide range of tv channels. Showers are very good, rooms cleaned to a high standard. Overall, a solid hotel which won't let you down"

1453,TinekevB,2015-04-30,3.0,"Expected more from high profile brand Selected hotel mainly because of convenient location. The room was small for the price we paid. They have modern gimmicks such as an Apple computer, but we'd rather have had some space on either side of the beds. Now it was all very cramped. Breakfast buffet was OK, but not above average. Staff was friendly, breakfast waiter brought pot of green tea without asking second day. And when we had a bar snack one evening, we were moved to the restaurant area by staff when a stag party arrived."

Rooms are well equipped with iMac TV etc.
Food was excellent value and worth trying (accepting restaurant  is small and open so not much privacy)
Good office areas and well equipped business room.
Location is perfect for quays dining etc. and you are a short walk to the main shopping area.
Staff are very helpful and professional.
Overall beats many 5 star hotels I have stayed in."
1455,136michaelf,2015-06-30,3.0,Standard middle-class hotel The hotel needs some modernization. Lobby is small and looks awful. Many parts of the hotel look like there was no change within the last 30 years. But it is clean. The expensive breakfast could be improved in quality. The breakfast room is far from nice and comfortable. The hotel has only a small car-park!
1456,TrevorJune,2015-05-31,4.0,tour accommodation Stayed there 2 nights as part of a tour.  We were most appreciative of the very reasonably priced laundry.  Free wifi and nice modern room which although not spacious was clean and tidy.  Excellent breakfasts with loads of options (including make yourself waffles) and the tour had farewell dinner there which was a buffet style and was reasonable. Very good location.
1457,Z7732FAjanm,2015-06-30,4.0,"Good hotel, great location. Was happy with our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn.  The location couldn't be better, within five minutes walk of Bristol Temple Mead station and an easy 5/10 minute stroll through a beautiful little garden to restaurants/bars, nightlife and waterside.  Our room, although not large, was good with everything the traveller could need plus an iMac, lockable (?) fridge and safe.  Plenty of room for clothes storage and a decent sized bathroom.  Our staff interactions were all positive and the breakfast was great.  Not sure about the background music in the communal areas though."
1458,gribbler1,2015-06-30,5.0,"great place for a weekend in Bristol! We stayed here for two nights, whilst my son was attending an Open Day at the university. This is the perfect place as it is just five minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads station;  and ten minutes walk to the city centre and harbourside. There is a bus stop directly outside the door, with frequent buses taking you to the city centre, Clifton, and beyond.
The hotel itself was spotless. The room was more than adequate for our needs, although it is compact. The fridge was a welcome bonus. Breakfast was fantastic, with all you could wish for-and more.
On the first night, we ate in the restaurant-as that was part of our ""deal""-and enjoyed one of the best meals we have ever eaten.
All the staff were lovely-friendly and helpful-without exception!
We will definitely stay here again."
1459,carrie13x,2015-04-30,4.0,"nice comfortable stay We stayed here for a sunday night in April and again on a Monday night in May.
We chose this hotel mainly because of the price, both booked in the Hilton sale.
As Hilton honor members we checked in online the day before and picked the rooms we wanted and check in time (we went with 3pm as this was the earliest).
On both occasions the room was not ready which is disappointing when you have selected the room and check in time the day before. 
On the first stay they phoned up and got the cleaners to get the room ready while we waited. On the second stay they ended up changing our room when they couldnt get a hold of anyone. This was a shame but did not ruin out stay.
The rooms are quite small but have everything you need.
There is also an empty fridge in the room which is useful. The shower was also very nice and powerful. 
Breakfast was great, lots to choose from and everything was very nice. 
On one stay we got a day ticket for the bus which stops outside the hotel which is very convenient. 
We would return here again next time we see a good deal."
1460,cltc43,2015-06-30,5.0,"Couldn't be faulted Having to catch an early train from Temple Meads, my wife and I stayed here the night before as it is (along with the Novotel) the nearest hotel to the station apart from the rather noisy Holiday Inn Express.  It would also have been convenient for the shopping area and main bus routes if we had wanted them.

We received a very friendly welcome at reception, the room was fine (and soundproofed, so quiet at night) though the bathroom was very small, and the buffet breakfast was one of the better ones we have had in hotels, and well-organised.  The very Bristolian lady doing the fried eggs was quite a character and rather different from the usual bland staff one finds in chain hotels.  

This is a modern building with a high standard of decor - we had no problems at all and it was a relaxing start to our holiday."
1461,swivena,2015-06-30,4.0,"Weekend getaway We arrived Friday evening at 7.30 pm. Was quickly and efficiently given our key cards to room. Nice room queen bed,. Modern and clean  Tea/coffee facilities. Hair-dryer toiletries. Apple computer /tv. Ironing board and iron. Safe everything you need really.
 We were facing the road and had no trouble with traffic noise. 
We went down stairs to the restaurant for evening meal as we had both been working that day and travelling there we just wanted a quiet relaxing evening. Good service with a good choice of food.
We then went into the bar area and had a drink good service again. 
The team at this hotel are very good,. 
We had a good nights sleep in the comfy room. Good breakfast with the same friendly staff from the night before. Plus from the chef lovely lady.  Nice choice. 

Bad area very cramped to get to the self service buffet. 

Good position of Hotel  only 10 mins walk to the shopping centre or train station. 
After being out all day shopping and sightseeing, thought have a lovely shower before going out to eat., My personal flannel  different colour to their white towels had been taken from the shower cubicle they couldn't have thought we had left as other items was left there. Plus the bath mat which was theirs. But why !!!!  i had informed reception and they phoned housekeeping they put two white ones  there then for next morning reception staff said take one home. I didn't. 
That was only something small but i do expect my own property to be safe in the bathroom.  With the tight fit in the breakfast area this is why i classing a 4 star not a 5. 
Overall had a really good stay. Clean modern and a friendly team. 
Keep up the good work ."

The receptionist seemed quite unhelpful and I was starting to think 'uh-oh!' Then I came across Teresa - she was brilliant. She placed me and my brother in next door rooms - even calling us half an hour later to come back and check in that the rooms were ready. She checked us in personally, was helpful, friendly and very efficient - nothing was too much...this is more like the Hilton service we know!!

The rooms were located on the first floor - clean, tidy and just felt good!!

The bathroom was in a good condition too - clean!

1463,noddyboots,2015-06-30,5.0,"A bit of luxury because one (!) is worth it Had the afternoon tea for two and it was delicious, nicely presented, the staff were polite and helpful plus the jazz music in the background and white and chrome décor all contributed to the ambience. We had a large selection of teas and could choose coffee if we wished, a selection of cakes on a cake stand which included small slices of cheesecake, millionaire shortbread, berry tart, scones with cream and jam plus a selection of finger sandwiches such as ham and tomato,cheese and pickle and salmon. We liked it so much we stayed after for a fair old while just reading the papers and chatting which we enjoyed. There is a lot of food so you might not finish it all but the waitress kindly let us bring a cake or two home in a paper bag which she brought over for us. The view also I nice because there is a charming small park just outside (Temple Park I think it might be called) which I had never seen before visiting this café. I can strongly recommend a visit here - even when I visited the ladies, a member of staff who was visiting it at the same time smiled and said 'hello'.There were a few customers apart from us so it was not crowded or too busy. We went to a very exclusive hotel in London recently for tea and it was a lot more expensive for a lot less. Treat yourself!"
1464,emmam72,2015-06-30,3.0,"Mixed bag I'm having trouble reviewing this hotel. 

It's small but comfortable. Clean, but lacks attention to detail. 

A twin room is really cramped and there is no room for a second suitcase. We spent the 2 nights stepping over my suitcase on the floor.

We didn't get two towels and unfortunately didn't discover this until too late to ask for another one. Unfortunately the same happened the next day despite leaving a note for house keeping.

Our room also wasn't cleaned till way after 4pm. They also didn't leave any normal coffee. I did get some brought up on request very promptly though. I suspect this is just a housekeeping issue. 

Anyway. If you walk out the door on the left  (facing reception) you can take a stroll through Temple gardens to Victoria st, and from there the old city is a 10 min walk, which is really convenient. 

The breakfast is great and the staff there are really friendly, quick and helpful,"

The bedroom and en suite were  spotless, lovely comfortable bed and fluffy pillows, offering a perfect nights sleep.

I stayed here for one night on business and chose this given its close proximity to the main train station and city centre - it was perfect for both being 5 minutes walk away. The hotel facilities were very good, with a range of spaces to take dinner. The rooms, albeit not huge, were very well equipped with an iMac covering Internet and TV.

1467,lj4312uk,2015-06-30,3.0,"Some confusion Firstly don't be mistaken this is not a Hilton its run under license from Hilton ie a franchise I guess.
In my view it is not really a residential hotel more a stopover similar to a Premier Inn though the restaurant food is a step up but the buffet breakfast is just that and pretty basic.
We booked a Queen Parkview for 4nts but were surprised by the cramped size of the rooms. So enquired whether there were larger. Apparently there all the same however if you have an easy access room there is considerably more space. But and its a big But the beds in easy access are only standard double. The Management were apparently genuinely unaware of this but persistence paid off and they actually went and checked and found I was correct. 
I am pleased that they very graciously conceded this and assure me arrangements are underway to make all beds Queen-size.
If you are aware of these points and can get a reasonable price comparable to other similar types of Hotel its well situated run by very pleasant staff and spotlessly clean.
Thank you all for what turned out to be a pleasant if a little cramped stay."

1469,Kernowcouple94,2015-06-30,4.0,"Clean, comfortable and contemporary Nice hotel, close to BTM (its a nice walk actually, if you go out the back of BTM, past the new office blocks and close to the river, rather than braving the horrible roads on the more direct route). Hotel is clean and modern. Welcome was friendly, although bit of a slow check-in, so had to wait a while as queues had built up (I find this part of hotels a real pain when you're tired after a long journey - some hotels need to put more resources into the check in process - this one did OK). I agree with one of the previous reviewers about the toiletries made in China - that is poor, when the hotel should be supporting hopefully local manufacturers, as well as the 'non-green' cost of transportation too. Apple imac TV is intended to be impressive I guess, but sometimes simple is better - i.e. a normal TV with a decent sized screen? Free and very good WiFi is great to see, with no annoying sign-in pages. 

I would use this hotel again, as positives much outweigh the niggles."
1470,JHG26,2015-06-30,5.0,"Lovely hotel Of all the hotels I've stayed in, this one is probably my favourite. 
It's very cozy and welcoming, with friendly staff. 
Instead of a TV, there's an Apple Mac in the room which is great because you have access to the Internet rather than just on your phone. If there's nothing you want to watch on TV, you can turn to YouTube, Netflix etc. 
The fridge was a bonus. 
The room was clean, light and airy. One small thing, only one chair is really needed - for the computer. As nice as the chairs are, they're a bit chunky and take up space. 
There's also a 'pantry' down in the lobby, full of necessities, food, drink for a reasonable price. I thought this was a good idea, especially if you're feeling lazy and don't want to walk to the shops. 
Overall, lovely hotel and we'll be returning again soon."

1472,Cuddlybear2014,2015-06-30,2.0,Review For Stay in June Good reception and Bar Staff. Clean and room ok. However I awarded this hotel a very low review and this is purely for something that I feel very strongly about. The toiletries in the bathroom were made in China. It is very difficult to see this as it is very small print. Now China are very good at lots of things but not really that good at cosmectics or toiletries. Also it it not very environmently friendly to have it sent from so far away. So come on Hilton lets have something like Molton Brown or something similar for a Hotel that is charging £109 per night for room. I did use some of the shower wash. It was bright orange and of poor quality. This is obviously a cost saving exercise.

1475,DaveSwin,2015-02-28,4.0,"Not really up to Hilton standard I've stayed at Hiltons all over the country and this Hilton physically wasn't up to scratch.  It used to be a budget hotel which Hilton bought and upgraded, but the sizes of the rooms and other physical characteristics let it down.

I still gave it a 4 star for really good staff and a good breakfast."
1476,Paddy53,2015-06-30,4.0,"Nice hotel Visited for the weekend.

Paid quite a lot for the room, which is quite small. However there is everything you need in it, including an iMac for browsing - it  doubles as the TV. The bathroom is small but again has everything you need, and the shower was powerful and hot. Wifi is free and perfectly adequate . Breakfasts are good, with plenty of choice of hot and cold food.

The staff are, without exception, really good - pleasant and friendly, and nothing is too much trouble for them.

Location is ok, not far from the station and about a 10 minute walk to the city centre.

My only criticism is that £12 for overnight parking is expensive."
1477,Carolejeanie66,2015-06-30,5.0,"Bristol Bonus Had a great stay at this hotel at the weekend whilst we were in Bristol celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary. Although we weren't at the hotel long the time we had was lovely. Nothing to complain about! The car park for the hotel only has about 30 spaces however, but there's another car park literally up the road which is secure and convenient and actually a little bit cheaper! By the way - I'd mentioned it was our 25th anniversary and out of the blue the hotel gave us a lovely personalised dessert when we arrived! A nice touch!"
1478,suziqueue,2015-06-30,4.0,"Clean hotel with lovely staff Stayed here last minute due to a flight cancellation.  Room was quite small and although tagged as a Park view you couldn't really see much of the park.  However, as we were only staying for the night as long as the bed was comfortable (it was very much so) and the shower was powerful and hot - again big tick in this box, I didn't mind.  I would have liked then to turn the music down in the café slightly earlier (stopped at 11.15) however once that was off it was quiet enough.  Breakfast was lovely with a special mention to Jane who was the chef that morning, making the eggs and generally making everyone smile - it made all the difference to our stay.  All the other staff were helpful as well, including the fact that one of the managers when they spotted we had queued for a while at reception came to check us out.  Would happily return."
1479,JENaaa,2015-06-30,4.0,"Just the job Ok so Hilton hotels don't have the 1st class reputation they had a few decades ago but this one was great.  Very helpful friendly staff, £70 for a double room on a Sat night, clean spacious room, comfy bed, nice size bathroom and fantastic location, short walk to train station and city centre.  Didn't visit the bar or restaurant so cannot comment on those."
1480,DougM562,2015-06-30,4.0,"Good, modern, well maintained city hotel I've stayed here quite a few times now when working in the Bristol area and find this to be a nice, clean, bright and well maintained city hotel.
All of the staff I have come into contact with (front desk, restaurant, bar and room service) are polite, friendly, helpful and efficient.
Whilst some of the drinks are a bit pricey, they are no worse than other hotels in the area.  The food is always good quality, including that offered for room service and for breakfast, for which there is plenty of choice.  A nice touch at breakfast, which is the usual self-service offered by most city hotels now, is having a chef on duty at the food counter who will cook a fresh omelette or eggs to your liking.
The fairly recent introduction of self-service tea and coffee at breakfast would benefit from having some pots available to put the drinks in, rather than having to return to the table where the urns and tea bags are each time you want a re-fill.
As mentioned by other reviewers, there is only limited on-site car parking available, which can be an inconvenience at times since the nearby car parks are not the easiest to use in light of having to continually renew 'pay and display' tickets.
I've never had any real problems with the free Wi-Fi, other than it dropping out sometimes, but that has only been on quite rare occasions.
Whilst the rooms are not particularly large, and the bathrooms are quite compact, they are clean, well-kept and certainly have all the facilities you are likely to need.
I, like others, prefer the rooms at the back of the hotel which overlook the park, but these seem to fill up quite quickly, even by the time I arrive on a Monday.
This is a really nice place, very conveniently located for where I sometimes work and I have enjoyed all my stays here to date.
Would I stay here again?  Yes, definitely; I've already booked my next stay, and just hope that I can find a parking space and get a room overlooking the park when I next arrive."

1482,GeorgieLu,2015-06-30,5.0,"So lovely! This hotel is really, really nice! My friend and myself were booked for 2 nights. The rooms are clean and really nice. Breakfast was tasty and diverse. Can't fault a Hilton breakfast buffet anywhere you would go. 
I would like to mention Aga (the breakfast supervisor) who was nice and approachable, chef who approved to have a takeaway breakfast in our second morning. We had a very early flight to catch. As well, Laszlo was great! He was very friendly, nice and professional. 
We are definitely coming back!!!"
1483,Sub_three,2015-06-30,3.0,Good aspects let down by hesitant and indifferent service so only an average on this occasion Travelled down by train on a dismal wet and windy Monday night arriving just before the restaurant was due to close. Wasn't best please after negotiating the smokers clustered in the doorway when the receptionist was rather more keen signing me up to some loyalty scheme rather than checking me in. A quick recce of the room and then down to the restaurant for a late evening supper. Turning up unexpected seemed to be more than the restaurant staff could cope with despite the fact that the restaurant was around only one-third full. Eventually managed to get seated and presented with a menu and then promptly ignored - after several minutes of fruitlessly trying to attract some-one's attention had to get up out my seat and go and interrupt a lady who was clearing tables so that I could order something to eat. Food when it arrived was very good (delivered hot and fresh to the table - a pity the quality of service didn't match the quality of the food) - waitress service for the rest of the meal was also very good and delivered with a smile which is always nice particularly at the end of a rough day. An early start the next day meant having to miss out on breakfast - tea and coffee facilities in the room were fine as was the comfort of the room itself. Would I stay here again - most likely yes as the location is okay and the comfort of the room also - I would hope though for more welcoming service in the restaurant.
1484,430gabrield,2015-05-31,5.0,"What a surprise! We spent last weekend visiting my son in Bristol. He booked us in at the Hilton Garden Inn and must have mentioned that it was my wife's birthday on the Saturday. We checked in with a very pleasant young lady who was very charming and she wished my wife in advance for her birthday.
When we got back to our room that evening we were pleasantly surprised to find a couple of slices of cake in a plate with 'Happy Birthday' written across the top of the plate. A lovely touch.
The room was clean and well stocked with added benefit of a fridge in the room. We did enjoy our stay at the Hilton in Bristol and am sure we would use them again should we go to Bristol again."
1485,axel6699,2015-06-30,4.0,"Tidy and clean revamped Two nights business trip, needing in work late and eat in, this fitted the bill perfectly. Obviously a recent revamp with new carpets, paint job and furniture, plus iMac in the room (with a small sound system) which did the trick - much better than a below average widescreen TV on the wall personalised with your name and muffled sound.

Nice super-king (instead of the single I'd been told) plus sensible lighting controls. Yes it did feel on the warm side so A/C was on all night. Free and instant wi-fi worked well (why don't all hotels have this as standard?)

OK food with above average service in the restaurant, but decor a little bland.

Front desk good and smiley, all good I guess. Would book again."

The air conditioning units in the rooms do not cool down the rooms and this lets down the hotel . I did speak to staff and they said they would fix this but unfortunately it was not rectified. Breakfast was good with lots of choice and there was a chef who would cook eggs to your own choice .

1489,monodera,2015-05-31,4.0,"Coin Operated Laundry It's a Hilton, so you can expect the usual standard.  But the coin operated laundry facility is greatly appreciated, especially for the 2.5 week UK road trip that brought me to this hotel.  

There is on site parking as well, for a £12 overnight fee.  This seems to be the average throughout the UK, so it is what it is.

The hotel has an internal (non fire escape) staircase that provides access to all the upper floors, in addition to the elevator.  For those who do not like waiting for the elevators, this is a welcome feature.  

The rooms are well equipped, but sized a bit on the small size.  The Apple computer which doubles as a TV is a nice touch, along w/ the built-ins that are rather functional so that makes up for it.

All in all, a good deal.  I would stay there again."
1490,Mishabgt,2015-05-31,5.0,"Wonderful hotel - temperamental WiFi I stayed here on a business trip and was very impressed with the staff and facilities.
The breakfast in the morning was perfectly cooked and the ""make your own"" waffle machine is a nice touch which I've not seen in other hotels before.

Although my room had an Apple Mac computer for TV and Internet, the free wifi in the room was temperamental and slow when it did work. As I don't like using my work systems on shared computers this caused me a little grief as I was not able to work as quickly as normal.

£12 for the night nights parking was consistent with the area and with the town centre a few minutes walk away I will definitely be back (though I will ask for a room with better wifi)"
1491,nothingatall666,2015-05-31,2.0,"Expected more from the reputable hotel. A late booking as I found myself needing somewhere to stay for the night. All my preferred hotels were booked up and so I booked my first stay at the hilton hotels. 

Check-in was fairly quick and I received a good service from staff there. The room was a good size - it took me a moment to go round switching the lights on to see what the room was like. 

Good storage, fridge, safe and wifi connected easily. 
not entirely sure how I felt about the gimmicky iMac situation - I'd probably have preferred a bigger TV - but I can see the benefit to those who have not travelled with a computer. 
The bathroom was very average, though I Liked the folding door.

Unfortunately I didn't get on very well with the bed. The hard mattress was difficult to get comfy on and the duvet was too thin.

I checked out using express checkout and still am yet to receive the invoice for the nights stay. 

I doubt I will be booking a hilton experience again."

We rang and made a reservation for Wednesday evening, when we arrived at the restaurant they could not find our reservation and it turned out our voucher was actually only valued on weekends anyway. The situation was handled smoothly and very efficiently and we were offered a table and redemption of our voucher.

The three course meal was absolutely wonderful and the service perfect. My partner had pate and I had a savoury tartlet to start, which were both full of fresh flavours, we both had chargrilled salmon as our main, which was amazing and for dessert we had tart tatin and chocolate fondant which were both lovely.

A great thank you to the two ladies who looked after us, for their attentive and friendly service and patience sorting out our voucher issue. We'll be back!"

Was very happy to get to our room to have a free chocolate brownie for my birthday this made it special,the staff couldn't do enough for us and very professional.

  3 Examples include:
* no umbrellas on rainy days - they could sell you one though! Which of course you would leave behind if you were flying in/out. 
*cheap nasty toilet roll that is better suited to a 1 star hotel.
*no pots for tea or real coffee in rooms or dining room or bar.

It's about 10 mins walk from Temple Meads station and there is on site parking much improved now that the owners appear to realise that cars have become wider over the past 20 years or so. Reception is always efficient and friendly and the common parts and rooms appear to be subject to ongoing refurbishment which some would say is not before time. Any remaining  tiredness in appearance is however more than made up for by the staff who are unfailingly cheerful and helpful and by the restaurant which manages to serve good freshly cooked food which is well priced and very good value - Best thing?

1520,A_Huntley_Jacobs,2015-04-30,4.0,"A garden retreat in the heart of the city My first time in Bristol and it was a shame it was for one night only. Bristol in the spring sunshine was a very pleasant experience, and walking by the river and waterway inlets reminded me a little of Copenhagen.

The hotel is a classic modern city type property. No grand entrances or lobby, however the staff on the desk were super efficient and most welcoming.

The room was very clean, you have a fridge which you can stock yourself - but I found the offerings from the vending machine downstairs expensive and the sandwich I bought was basic and stale.

Having stayed at a couple of Marriott establishment's  recently - where it appears the policy of the hotel chain is to provide beds which are best described as marshmallow-esque - fine if you like that sort of thing - I prefer a harder mattress. This was perfect, not rock hard - but firm and I slept like a baby.

If you walk through the garden style small park at the rear entrance of the building, in about 90 seconds you are on a road with shops, pubs and the route into the town centre.

The other access to the building is a duel carriageway with little to offer.

It's about a 15 minute walk into town - which was enjoyable on the warmest day of the year thus far.

Parking is additional twelve pounds - which the website did not state.

The Cafe bar attached to the lobby had a contemporary décor feel to it, but again the prices were a tad above what I would expect to have to pay for their offerings.

All in all a good one night stay"

1523,338iann,2015-04-30,5.0,"Great stay Stayed for 3 nights on business and was delighted with my choice. Small but well maintained room which was clean and functional. Easy to control room temperature which I often find is a problem in other places I stay. Bathroom was very small, only just big enough for 1 person to squeeze in. The shower was very good.

Breakfast was well cooked and had plenty of choice although did vary slightly during my stay. It was still good even at it's worst. A colleague said the evening meal was excellent although I did not experience that myself.

The worst part of my stay was the Apple TV in my room. Not many channels unless you accessed the internet and then I found it didn't always want to work properly, mainly because the software was 4+ years out of date and the computer kept asking for updates it couldn't complete.

This hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the railway station and close to many businesses/offices. A 15 minute walk or a short water taxi ride will get you to a large selection of bars and restaurants if the ones nearby do not suit."
1524,albertom956,2015-03-31,5.0,"A Great Place To Stay in Downtown Bristol We recently stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn in Bristol (Bristol City Centre) for four days and we enjoyed our time there immensely. It's a great hotel in the best of locations, near the train and bus stations and walking distance to many pubs, restaurants, and shopping. The staff there (especially Anne, Jane and Laura) made our stay even more special. We were welcomed by Laura who handled our check in and check out flawlessly and even contacted me about something (a small lapel pin) which I had lost there. She later mailed it to me!  Anne, from housekeeping, kept us impeccably neat and clean throughout our stay and Jane, breakfast chef and Bristol native, made the best tasting and friendliest served eggs (""here y'are m'darlin"") we've ever had. The room was well designed but a bit spartan space-wise, although It helped to have at hand a nice big mac for our in-room tv and pc combined. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Obviously the business travellers had already discovered this gem, because while we were there vacationing for several days, during the two week days we spent there, business men and women packed the place solid."
1525,orangutanBB,2015-04-30,3.0,"Not as good as expected from Hilton We visited on a weekend away to Bristol. First impressions were not great, the car park was small and spaces were very close together. Also people had parked in areas that were not spaces, which made getting in/out of spaces very difficult. We were charged £12 for 24 hours, but there is also another car park round the back, which I believe is not owned by the hotel. We arrived at about 1.30pm and there was a very long queue at check in, where they were checking in a large group. This took up most of the reception area so it was very messy and noisy and we ended up waiting 20-30 mins for check in. The room itself was quite small, but very very warm. We had paid extra for the ""park view"" room, but this was nothing more than a bit of grass in a small area next to a church which does not even exist anymore! Definitely mis sold that and would not recommend paying extra for this. The air conditioning doesn't work very well and half the time, didn't even seem to be on as it kept turning itself off. Bathroom was small as well, but the shower was powerful. Although the Apple TV looked good, it was too small to use as a TV as well. I have neck problems, so when I saw the pillows were too soft for me, I called reception and asked if they had memory foam pillows. I was told they only had synthetic or feather pillows which were already in my room - both were so soft combined with the soft mattress meant my husband and I had a very bad back and neck in the morning! Very surprised the hotel did not have more of a variety of pillows, thought this would be quite a common request especially for Hilton hotels and even more so, as another hotel chain even offers a pillow menu to choose from! The hotel did not seem to keep the large group on one floor, as they were very noisy in the middle of the night and woke us up a few times talking and running up and down the corridor very loudly. Breakfast was ok the next morning, but again due to the large group, there were not many tables available and the queue for the food was very long. The location of the hotel is just outside the main city centre, so does take some time to walk in - maybe about 10 minutes, depending where you wanted to go. The area itself is very quiet and not much around. Overall, only ok stay, would have expected more from Hilton and probably would not stay here again."
1526,johnhK1804FF,2015-04-30,4.0,"Cracking weekend Excellent stay ,very good hotel friendly staff, superb breakfast. Hotel is an very good position to visit Bristol for the weekend, ferry service to the centre of Bristol is only two minutes walk which makes a novel way to get into the centre. Disappointed about the car parking charges at the hotel stayed two nights and was charged £36 for parking which totally unacceptable ,we stay quite a lot in Southampton at equivalent hotel group and get charged £6:00 a night. All in all though a very good hotel and Bristol is a cracking good weekend."
1527,DiddyDave,2015-04-30,5.0,Great Stay Great Location and Facilities for this Hotel. Lovely rooms. Within easy reach of the shopping and bars. Would use again no problem. No TV in rooms but Apple Computers provide both TV and Internet services. Channels include sky sports which is a bonus.
1528,Highflyer01,2015-04-30,4.0,"Nice hotel, limited parking Stayed in April 2015 for 1 night. Staff were helpful and the hotel was clean throughout. The room was of a good standard and the glazed windows kept out all of the traffic noise from outside, allowing a good night's sleep. Unfortunately I was not able to use the hotel parking due to it being full and had to use a city council operated car park instead. Other than that, I would stay again."
1529,Glennyd,2015-04-30,4.0,"Good Value with a Nice Breakfast Stayed for one night on a weekend trip to Bristol. The hotel is near to the main train station at Bristol Temple Meads and is also within walking distance of the attractions, shopping and night life. The hotel was clean comfortable and the staff friendly its nothing fantastic but it is a good hotel and ideal for a short stay. two good pubs the other side of the small park (Temple Gardens) opposite the hotel. Would stay there again if ever in Bristol."
1530,briangX2413MM,2015-04-30,5.0,Brilliant Trip We went to the Bespoked Bicyle show and selected the hotel for its proximity to the venue. The hotel was simply superb and the staff were dedicated to making our stay a real pleasure - which it was. The early check-in provision was especially welcome to us as we had driven a long way to reach the hotel and it was very convenient to be able to relax in our room and have breakfast straight away.
1531,SAshleyC,2015-04-30,4.0,"Nothing to complain about  The hotel was modern and clean and check in was swift and pleasant enough. 
The room was smart and well decorated in a modern style, with an Apple PC in the room to be used (and abused!). 
Only minor complaint was that the A/C wasn't very cool at all, and although that was not especially a problem now, I imagine that it would be when it gets warmer. 

For the price paid, it was good value - but there was nothing outstanding to warrant the 5th Star."
1532,238angelar238,2015-04-30,4.0,"Well located well priced Booked simply to spend a night before a wedding in Bristol. The hotel is well located and reasonably priced and breakfast is included. The shower was good and the apple mc tv/computer was a nice touch. The room was spacious and comfortable. Two criticisms: first, the pillows were so soft they were not comfortable (although the mattress and bed generally were), second, although included within the price the breakfast did not start until 7am and I had to leave the hotel then so I missed it. I was tempted to order it room service but noticed a £4 surcharge for that. Nevertheless I would stay again. Very slow wi-fi."

After some unsatisfactory experiences in other hotels in Bristol, we decided to try the Hilton Garden Inn. It was good value for money, the staff were extremely polite and helpful, the evening meal was very good and reasonably priced. We felt that at last we had found a place to stay which is within our price range, and where we feel comfortable and welcome. The park opposite the Hotel is very beautiful and peaceful, even though one is in the centre of town. We shall certainly be staying there again."

1536,wavey75,2015-04-30,3.0,"Trampolines with duvets! Checking in: Prepare to stand in the queue for a while! Rooms: Nicely done, clean and tidy overall. A/C leaves a lot to be desired as the rooms are so warm, evan at max it's still too hot. Beds: So soft and bouncy, I rolled over in the night and the bed threw me out onto the floor! you have been warned. Room Fridge: More of a cold cupboard, but reception explain prior to check in. Bathroom: shower's amazing, nice and powerful and it goes very hot. Bathroom size I felt was very small, felt compact for a Hilton hotel IMHO. Hallways: apart from the lobby, all walkways are carpetted, making a wheeled suitcase or wheelchair 10 times harder to push, so beware. Breakfast: there's a self-service waffle maker and batter dispenser & maple syrup, as well as the traditional breakfast buffet... need I say more? The breakfast was upto the highest standard, except that the ""butter"" I do not beleive was real ""butter"" it tasted very oily indeed."

1538,mikekV723XA,2015-03-31,4.0,Friendly and comfortable stayed here a few times now and find the staff to be helpful and friendly.  The rooms are comfortable and I normally manage to get a good nights sleep.  The breakfast is fine for a buffet but if you're sitting in the wrong place it can take a while to get a cup of tea.  The bar staff are very good and the service there is very good too.  If I had one issue it would be the parking.  It's pretty small and its a bit of a lottery if you're able to park there.  Not sure there's much they can do about that though.
1539,Michaelfox28,2015-03-31,5.0,"A great find in the centre of Bristol This was a last minute reservation to spend an overnight Friday to explore Bristol. We arrived around midday and there was no problem with an early check in. The room was very comfortable and a contemporary design, well maintained and good value. From check in to departure the staff were very friendly, welcoming and great customer care. A good sign of a well managed hotel. The housekeeping staff were very obliging in providing extra toiletries. Breakfast was very fresh and excellent value for the quality and range of breakfast food. The chef was particularly cheerful and very homely. 
It's nice to be able to make a genuine and positive recommendation for a hotel chain."
1540,simonw804,2015-03-31,4.0,"Very clean/friendly staff We really enjoyed our stay and we were excited to try the iMac in our room. The only note is that we feel that the booking.com ad implied the iMac and tv were separate, meaning no HDMI on the iMac to plug in my laptop."

I stayed here with 3 friends, location good, room is clean, modern, no complaints about the actual hotel/room but the receptionist when we checked in needs to practice her customer service skills! Completely rude and arrogant!! When asking her about taxi, city etc she was very unhelpful and we felt as though we were asking too much from her! The receptionist in the night however was friendly and very helpful! Great value for money but the receptionist completely got my back up."

Inadvertently booked an accessible room on the ground floor, which had a great wet room. Lovely comfy bed and great iMac instead if a normal TV.

The staff here are lovely and friendly and seem to actually enjoy their work.

Great breakfast, although a bit of s queue, but only because all the eggs are cooked fresh to order. 

Would definitely recommend."

1545,954nickh,2015-03-31,4.0,"Good Stay Handy for station and city centre, queen room was ok for single person, but think it would be cramped for 2. Liked the apple computer in the room. Free cake samples at check in was a nice touch. Breakfast was very good. I was not confident with the check in staffs ability, they had me recorded as a no show when I checked out even though I fully checked in at reception early in the evening the night before."

I stated no my company are paying for it & showed her my booking confirmation which clearly stated this! My booking was for a queen room, I had a tiny room with a double bed that was rock hard! Softer sleeping on the floor! The iMac tvs that the Hilton have been stitched up with didn't work & the repair man took all evening to fix (luckily I was going out!) Awful nights sleep could hear person above on the toilet! Was woken by a letter coming under my door at 2am informing me that my car parking will be deducted from my account!! Breakfast was nice but the lady cooking eggs had a giant queue and they weren't cooked long enough! On check out they asked me to settle my account and I stated the above which took them ages to sort! Absolute rip off for £145! Next time I'll stay in a £39 Premier Inn!"
1547,Stevewales44,2015-03-31,4.0,"Reception staff helpful Stayed here twice in the last month my first visit better than the recent one 
The reception staff are friendly and helpful and give a very good welcome 
The rooms are good and there is free internet 
The food in the bar area is very good 
On my recent stay there were a large group of makes swearing and using bad language during others eating and I was suprised that the manager did nothing about it
I rang to complain and was spoken to by the duty manager frank 
He gave no apology and even suggested it is a bar and it happens and just dismissed the complaint
If this happens they give a guarantee if they don't keep u satisfied then don't pay so I rang down and spike to reception again and said frank dismissed my complaint and I was not paying 
He then came to my room and agreed to take my food off the Bill and change my room so to avoid the noise from this group 
I would say the team leader on reception should be the duty manager as she was far more helpful and professional 
This is a good hotel but maybe duty managers need customer service training"

Guest laundry is good, free fitness room. Nice and pleasant place to stay."
1549,L1040LUamyc,2015-03-31,3.0,"Ok stay but nothing special Staff were nice enough and the room was clean and well furnished but was quite small. The guests in surrounding rooms were very noisy (I think we were amongst a hen party) and noise carried very easily so did not manage to get much sleep. I was part of a group of friends that booked three rooms, one of them smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke. When it was reported to reception apparently they offered to 'come up with some air freshener'..."
1550,smudgeleo,2015-02-28,4.0,"Lovely hotel The hotel is very easy to find by car which was a bonus as I have never stayed in Bristol before and not familiar with the city. The hotel and its interior are lovely, very modern, well designed and clean. Room was tidy and included everything it said on the description of the room when booking, such as hairdryer, tea/coffee making facilities and toiletries (which were replaced every day once used). Plenty of space for everything i.e. size of the room, plenty of drawer space. Nice big soft bed for a lovely night’s sleep, each room is sound proofed so the only noise you could hear outside was people in the hallway and opening/closing room doors.
The only issue we had was the parking. The car park is tiny!!! We arrived around 7pm on a Friday evening and managed to have the last car parking space. When we were checking in we were asked if we drove/how many nights we would be staying and was told we would be charged £12 parking fee per night. The following morning we wanted to explore but had to go back inside to ask at reception for a car park barrier ticket to actually leave the hotel via car. When we came back in the afternoon no parking spaces at all, this resulted in us having to search for another car park nearby (luckily the hotel is near the city center). We were warned by the friendly lady on reception that we might have trouble getting a space on our return and if so to try the car park around the back (not owned by the hotel), which was a maximum stay of 4 hours at a time plus a fee – obviously no good. She also informed us that they would happily refund any car parking fees if we were unable to find a space – no hassle at all; they even invoiced the refund for me for my bank records and delivered it to our room.
I would recommend the hotel as the staff were lovely and the room and location was great."
1551,andyorbabs,2015-03-31,5.0,"Great hotel I have never been compelled to write a TripAdvisor review to date, whilst always using it to make decisions around lodgings and restaurants, but feel this hotel warrants me to start doing so. 

I have stayed several times already at the hotel in 2015 and will be continuing to do so throughout the year.

The rooms are excellent: clean and stylish, as is the breakfast. The fitness room is also a nice bonus and the location is handy for the station and a short walk from many pubs and restaurants. However the thing that really makes the hotel is the staff - from the friendly greeting at reception to the housekeeping staff to the bar and breakfast teams, everyone is so friendly, professional and welcoming, and all look like they really enjoy being there and part of the team. It is really refreshing to see and has meant I would never consider trying another hotel in Bristol. 

I followed up with a stay in the Birmingham Garden Inn last week and whilst the facilities are similar, the hotel is let down slightly as it does not have the same buzz about the staff: they could learn a lot from all at Bristol. many thanks."

What made the stay a bit special were the staff, nothing was too much trouble and we would like to give a particular mention to the lovely lady behind the breakfast bar who cooks eggs to order, she was so friendly and chatty. We will be back for a chat in the near future. Have a look at the wonky church at the far side of the gardens."

Really nice and clean room, the only two bad things:

1) we could hear the noises in the corridor and sometimes from the other room.
2) the bed was a bit noisy

Close to the center and bus stop just outside the hotel.

Staff very kind!"
1554,JanineW10,2015-03-31,4.0,Check the disabled access first Parking was good if you could get a space - there are 2 for blue badge holders and parking is free which is a positive. But the size of the queen accessible room is not good and the room is really only big enough for 1 person and getting to the right side of the bed in our case was impossible. We were offered a room to sleep in on the 2nd floor and had to use the wet room on the ground floor ! Rooms are good but rated poor due to this incident.

There are a couple of significant negatives however. Don't bother bringing your cat as you wont be able to swing it, not even a kitten.The room size is tiny,the  bed size which is equally tiny is just a double, standing in the bathroom, I could touch all four walls and the car park is likewise tiny, so don't expect a parking space as there probably wont be any. All that said, its good value for money if you don't mind the lack of space."

1558,lil_traveller182,2015-03-31,5.0,"Lovely hotel really recommend  I have stayed in garden inn hotels in America and when I was thinking about what hotel to surprise my mum with for her birthday to have q relaxing time away in bristol, this was one of the first hotels I looked at as I was impressed with the American version I wanted to see what the UK version was like as never seen this hotel in England before. 

Upon arrival the reception were so friendly that you really felt welcome from the get go, it is a clean and welcoming entrance and a Mac on the reception to for you to use for emails if need be. The were very informative and really gave us all the information we needed. 

Upon my request / booking I asked for a quiet room and that's what we got. It was quiet all the time which is rare these days in a lot of hotels. 

The room, although upon first entrance looks small really isn't At all. It's for a lot more space then you think and the computer chairs, and the Mac really made a lovely touch. The windows are big and have lovely views and the bathroom is clean modern and very nice. 

The only little thing I would say is that one of the chairs in the room was in the centre of the carpet and would be better placed at the side as it is too heavy to move and if you get up at night it may hit your foot or walk into it. I found the bed a tad hard at first but they are actually very comfortable. 

We also had dinner in the restaurant the staff were very friendly and the food was lovely. Really recommend the muscles as the Hilton really know how to flavour them well. 

Overall a really nice hotel, welcoming, such nice staff and if you want somewhere which is near the city centre but also far enough away to be relaxing I really recommend it"

I also requested a slightly later check out so I wasn't hanging around before my interview and this was accommodated without question. The room, although on the small side was very clean and well equipped. The iMac was really useful for last minute reading up before the interview. The room was on the fourth floor and over-looked the garden to the rear and it was quiet as requested. I had the bed, breakfast and dinner package. The evening meal was beautiful and the staff very friendly, they made me feel at ease as I was dining alone. The only slight complaint, as already mentioned in other reviews as that the duvet was very thin, for some reason. Otherwise I can't really fault the hotel, a very enjoyable stay considering it was for a stressful interview!"

I was looking for somewhere I could revise and have a good night's sleep and this hotel provided this. I was in room 109 overlooking the main road but I found there was no disturbance as the windows are well soundproofed. I slept really well in the comfortable bed, even with pre-exam nerves. 
The room was pleasantly decorated and I was impressed with the TV system, quality toiletries, powerful hairdryer and well stocked tea/coffee making facilities. 
There were a few aspects that could be improved to have made this a very good stay. The bathroom door and tiles were dirty in places and I had to clean them with toilet roll. The bathroom door could actually benefit from being repainted. There were hairs in the shower. The skirting boards were topped with a layer of thick dust. I also found the room to be too warm and the air con system too loud and ineffective. 
On the plus side the staff were all friendly and helpful. I had dinner in the cafe/bar which was tasty and reasonably priced, and breakfast was good too. 
I will return in January for the night before my next exam."

May be if you have mobility issues this would be a little bit difficult because of walk (10 mins).   Would highly recommend."
1568,11BethanyH,2015-02-28,3.0,"Nice room..but some flaws. Room was nice and clean. Spacious, Well decorated. And the iMac was a nice touch. Meant you could use netflix in stead of watching rubbish T.V. 
The breakfasts were lovely and the lady on the egg counter was wonderful.

Only had a couple of problems, the duvets are super thin. And the heating/air con system noisy. Also the bed is on cannisters, it moved with every movement. And as a restless sleeper it was quite irritating. 

Also a big flaw. I rang earlier in the day to confirm they accepted my bank card (not everywhere does). Was informed they did accept it so not to worry. Only to get there and have it declined with ""bad format"" because they don't accept that card type. Not an issue, paid cash. But still embarrassing and frustrating.
Saying that though, would stay again. Overall a nice hotel."

The hotel is located about 15minutes from the centre of Bristol which was fine for us. Parking on site costs £12 per day it is worth turning up early as spaces are limited. Check in was quick and painless and staff were helpful with directions etc. Rooms were ample very clean and warm. The air conditioning in our room was noisy and didn't seem to work but overall very pleased.

Service from the staff was excellent- from greetings to showing us directions. 

We included the breakfast buffet which had lots of variety - cooked, pastries, fruit, cereals, toast, waffles- and was tasty. It was quite busy on the Sunday morning about 10am but they pulled some chairs around so we could all sit at the same table.

Rooms are on small side with very small but compact en suite. TV is integrated into Mac PC in room, This results in small , 24 inch screen , very slow when changing channels and poor picture quality.Heard another guest in bar complaining about TV. Please put normal TV in rooms. Surprised that there was no bath robes or slippers , no mini bar or heated towel rail in bathroom.These are usual in 4 star hotels.
Car park was full so had to park in public car park just across road.This shuts at 6.00 pm so your car stays in there until 7.00 am next morning. All in all , perfectly adequate hotel but more three star than four."

Even setting the wifi on my iPad for us.  We were meeting friends and nothing was too much trouble and staff made sure we were heading in the right direction for our meeting point! Breakfast was good and I found the bed very comfortable. Thank you
1575,Maverick1808,2015-02-28,4.0,"Angela Henry, Meath, Ireland On a recent trip to Bristol we were very lucky in our choice of this hotel.  It had a mixture of modern comforts and old time values. The friendliness of staff and attention to detail was all around the hotel. Had dinner in the restaurant which was first class. Rooms were spotless with a very comfy bed. We went for a food time but we certainly got the ""cream"" in Bristol"

1578,380warrenh,2015-02-28,5.0,"Excellent overall and good value! Great weekend in Bristol, hotel clean, staff all excellent and helpful. We had an excellent deal on dinner, bed and breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Do check that your room has a bath (only shower) as I missed this on ordering. City space I guess!"
1579,MichaelF233,2015-02-28,4.0,"Smart, modern and central. Stayed on business midweek. This is a very modern and quite contemporary hotel. Impeccably clean and very polite and attentive staff. The rooms are of an average size for city centre and very well equipped including air conditioning, ironing board and Mac computer amongst the usual items you would expect. Free Wifi and the bed was very comfy but suffered from the thin duvet syndrome you tend to find in a lot of new hotels.
If I was being picky, the bathroom was on the small side with not much room to maneuver. No bath either.
Didn't eat here in the evening but the buffet style breakfast was very good.
There are parking spaces available that you have to pay for although they were full so parked in a pay and display just down the road which is free between 18.00 and 8.00 payable before and after that. Beware I think the barrier is locked at night.
It will be on my list of good hotels in Bristol should I stay again."
1580,Gus0035,2015-02-28,4.0,"Pleasant stay The hotel was ideally situated near the train station and the venue for the students Fuze event we were attending. The room was clean and well equipped with tea/coffee, iron and ironing board, hair dryer and safe. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom although no bath had an excellent shower. We had a meal in the bar which was reasonably priced and surprisingly good. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful. We had a good nights sleep and would stay at this hotel again."

From the moment we walked through the doors we felt the warm welcome.
Rooms were spotlessly clean and a fabulous comfortable bed. Dinner in the restaurant was first class. Great hotel facilities including the 24 hour food and drink facility in the lobby.
The hotel is ideally located for the city centre and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any visitors to Bristol.

 The Chef at the breakfast buffet is lovely and make yourself feel at home, our waitress Patricia was also really nice and helpful with everything we needed."
1583,487ClaireR,2015-02-28,2.0,"Not a good experience! Wouldn't recommend  Not a good stay,  with all the options on bristol I won't bother with this hotel again.
We were kept waiting in reception for half an hour with all our bags whilst they struggled to find out booking and said without a confirmation email we wouldn't have a room and they were fully booked! Rooms had been paid for in advance so was worried about where my money had gone! Eventually they realised they had booked another guest in already under our name! Throughout this half hour there wasn't much reassurance that the situation would be resolved, no refreshments were offered whilst we stood at the desk for half an hour eventually after really complaining we were offered some vouchers for a free ""house wine "" at the bar which we then struggled to drink as we were now running late for our dinner reservation! 
Also their car park was full do they recommended one just down the road but the payment times are between 8am an 6pm everyday and you can't pay in advance meaning after a night out in had to get up at 745 get dressed and how back to the car to put a new ticket on!!! Seriously unimpressed with this from a supposedly 4* hotel!  
The cleaners had clearly been taking a rest in our room as when we got in there was a random piece of lemon cake on the bed (no other selection of biscuits or cakes in our room or our friends so assuming it wasn't ment to be there!) it was next to the TV remote on the side of the bed with a nearly empty bottle of gator aid on the side and a still slightly warm hot water bottle in the bed!!! 
Also no bottled water in the rooms and was £1.50 for a small bottle from reception,  again for a 4* hotel charging £130+ per night in find this and really poor effort! 
And don't be fooled by the name it really isn't city centre, I wouldn't suggest you could walk to the city centre for the restaurant /bars you need a taxi!"
1584,LangstaffSD,2015-02-28,4.0,"Very friendly hotel ideally located ideally located for visiting the shopping quarter, floating harbour and old city all within an easy 15mins walk. The staff in the hotel were all very friendly and welcoming, hotel was very busy but everyone was dealt with promptly.  Although not the biggest of rooms,they are very clean and well appointed, especially like having the Apple Mac !  Not having to checkout till 12pm is a bonus. Breakfast was very good, we did arrive at rush hour (hungry stag party!) but the staff were quick to clear the queue and get more food and very apologetic."

Was made so welcome, on arrival I mentioned it was my Husband Rickys birthday, and as we got in our room a waitress arrived with a lovely welcome drink, the room was lovely and comfortable, and the staff could not be more helpful, they have so much time for you, and the lovely Lucyia hope I've spelt It right, was so so helpful, telling us of a lovely Italian Restaurant and also a lovely Indian restaurant, we certainly Will be back."

Room was small, as was bathroom but clean and pleasant.
Nice pub just across Temple Gardens."
1587,Goodfoodlover60,2015-02-28,3.0,"Can't fault the food or service.  Arrived for an anniversary but a twin room had been booked. This was very quickly sorted and changed to a double.
The rooms are a little on the small side but up to the usual high standard.
Dinner in the restaurant was first class, as was breakfast the following morning. The staff were very helpful.
The bed I found lacking and only had a few hours sleep the first night. I informed reception who said they would sort by adding an extra quilts under the sheet, however this wasn't done and I again only had a few hours sleep.
Satisfaction not guaranteed!
Won't be staying again but would certainly use the restaurant."
1588,MercedesBC,2015-02-28,3.0,"Too small! Our room was too small for a Hilton! Everything was fine, but the size! Breakfast was fantastic and the location was great if you wanted to be near Temple Meads Station. We changed to another hotel as we were spending a romantic weekend in Bristol. Not a chance in such a small room!"

Top class"
1590,Merguez9,2015-02-28,5.0,"Upgrade to park view 10 minute walk to Temple Meads Railway Station, 15 minutes to Old Town & St Nicholas market, 20 minutes to town centre and harbour. Good bus service to Clifton and Suspension Bridge. The hotel is all it advertises: comfortable, with good quality furnishings and all the usual gadgets you'd expect. The upgrade to a back room with view over a small park is worth it. We liked Pata Negra, a Spanish restaurant in the Old City, a relaxed 20 minute walk from the hotel."
1591,riverview-apartment,2015-02-28,5.0,"Valentines Dinner My husband and I had a very impressive 5 course meal at the Hilton Garden Inn on 14th February. Every lady was given a long stemmed rose and my husband and I were given a glass of prosecco. The staff were really lovely and even though they were very busy, they were very professional and made us feel very special. The food was amazing- I couldn't fault a thing. The steak was the best I have ever tasted and for the price of £35 per head in my opinion it was fantastic value.  We didn't stay at the hotel that evening, but I would definitely visit the restaurant again for the first class food and the impeccable service. I am hoping my husband books for next year! Thank you very much to everyone concerned who made my night a very special one."
1592,Ironpoker1,2015-01-31,4.0,"Pleasant night at the Hilton in Bristol We stayed here for 1 night (Sat) to see a concert at the O2 Academy in Bristol. Reception staff were genuinely friendly & professional, room was small but spotlessly clean and 'modernised'. location good but a bit of a walk into Bristol City Centre (maybe 15 mins). Very convenient to Temple Meade Rail station. Breakfast was really excellent - fresh & high quality & as other reviewers have pointed out the 'Egg Lady' is fabulous when you are recovering from the night before ... you'll understand when you get there !  Price was also very reasonable if booked ahead - only downside really was 1 'Gent' had far too much to drink/other substance and went beserk on 3rd floor outside our room at ~ 8 am ...not the Hiltons fault ...but not good ..."

The room turned out to look pretty much exactly how advertised, clean, light and modern! the bathroom is compact but ideal for a nights stay. The bed was comfy had a great night sleep, my favourite part however was the Apple Mac computer! all your channels and Internet, you can even watch what you like ok YouTube!

The staff at reception remembered us from our last stay a couple of months back and gave us the warmest of welcomes. The hotel itself is perfectly located to town center and easy to access from the M23, the rooms are very clean and bright. We had dinner with friends in the restaurant and we were all very impressed with our meal, the food is beautifully presented, very tasty and prices are very reasonable. The staff were very professional, courteous and welcoming throughout.  We had had a similar experience at breakfast were once again we were very well looked after by the breakfast staff and the food was very good.

1600,Aland6000,2015-02-28,4.0,Friendliest of Staff The hotel is well situated near to Temple Meads station. My room was quiet and spotless. Buffet style breakfast is enhanced by eggs cooked freshly as you require by a lady who acts just like your mother! You can also order kippers omlets etc. The bar price are reasonable by hotel standards. I did not have an evening meal in the hotel.
1601,R6896XWdavids,2015-01-31,2.0,Not a great hotel experience! I stayed here on recommendation from a friend. We really didn't enjoy our stay. We found the reception staff rude and looked like they didn't want to be there at all. The room was nice but I found marks on my pillows. When we had food I was looking forward to a nice meal but my starter came cold which I sent back. All in all lovely hotel and great reviews but they must of been having a bad day!
1602,ncokey,2015-02-28,4.0,"Great rooms The location is perfect very easy to get to and the parking is very reasonable 24 hours for £12.
Checkin and checkout were slow but staff helpful and friendly.
The bar is nice and drinks yet again reasonable priced. 
The room had a park view but not much to see really so I wouldnt pay the extra to be honest. The room is nicely decorated and the mac computer is excellent bed is very comfortable but the room was small and the bathroom very compact which was disappointing.
But in general would return to the this Hilton"
1603,dpw64,2015-02-28,5.0,"Great value and quality Afternoon Tea Booked this for a girls afternoon treat for 30 of us. Absolutely Fabulous. Quantity, quality and service was spot on. Non stop supply of varoius teas, sandwich and cake platter was plentiful, rounded off with two rock sized scones with jam and cream. Not many could finish off everything, so doggy bags were provided. Highly recommended at £12.95. Best one we have had."
1604,Candicestr,2015-02-28,3.0,"Great location for the city shame about the bed! The room was really clean and well stocked. A little small to spend time in but ok just to sleep. Loved the Apple Mac but would have liked space to sit and watch TV rather than just from the bed. 

The bed was the worst bed I've ever slept in!!!!!!!!

It was so hard that I saw every hour tick by. I ask reception if we could move to a softer bed after night one but they didn't have any, the lovely receptionist did say she could get someone to put a quilt over the mattress. But upon our return from an evening out that didn't happen. :( so 2 nights of little sleep!! 

£24 for car parking at the hotel is extortionate and really needs to be lowered. And the food & drinks in the bar were too expensive!! £4.70 for a single short and mixer!! And £15 for a burger and chips (with shop bought coleslaw and plastic cheese)!! I'd understand restaurant prices in the restaurant but not in the bar!! 

That said the service was excellent, the staff really friendly (the lady making the eggs for breakfast definitely made my day, she was polite and funny)"

1608,Furet_Rouge,2015-01-31,5.0,"Comfortable, centrally located hotel The hotel is extremely easy to find and has a car park, although this is somewhat limited. 

The hotel has everything that can be expected of an economically priced hotel. The lobby is clean and modern and staffed 24 hours. There are good lifts to all floors. There is a restaurant on the ground floor, which also serves breakfast. 

I stayed in a room on the 3rd floor, it was quiet and a reasonable size. The room was equipped with a comfortable bed, alarm clock and iMac, which doubled as a telly. There was free internet access, both wired via the iMac and wifi. There was air conditioning. The room was clinically clean. 

The bathroom was equipped with a spacious shower but no tub. There was a range of nice toiletries to sample. 

The staff were friendly and welcoming and efficient and professional at all times.

The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads Station and about a 20 minute walk from the harbour area, where restaurants and so forth can be found. 

All in all I found my stay to be completely faultless and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a problem-free, comfortable stay."
1609,TrevorM74,2014-12-31,4.0,"Convenient and practical Stayed here in December when we needed somewhere to stay in Bristol overnight. The staff were friendly and efficient and the room clean and comfy. Bathroom was small but well designed. There's a nice park with a ruined church right behind the hotel and it's a pretty short walk to Queen Square and the docklands; there are also good coffee shops (Baristas Coffee Collective, Friska) very close on Victoria Street. The hotel is on a busy street but our room was at the back and we didn't notice any noise - and the busy street gives a quick route out of town if you're just passing through."
1610,Em0866,2015-01-31,5.0,"Another comfortable and great stay I have stayed in this hotel a few times now and each time it is just as comfortable as the last.  The bed is so comfortable I slept all night.  The only niggle I have here is that the dining room for breakfast is a little cramped.  It is a buffet breakfast so it can get a bit crowded and a bit of jostling to get to get to individual food items.  This, however, did not spoil my stay.  I shall be back."

1614,Meleke10,2014-12-31,3.0,"Not Bad Usually I stay at the Doubletree which I really like but thought I would give this a go. The hotel is really easy to get to from the train station and ideal being close to the centre. The lady at check in with blonde hair did not really make us feel welcome, she was very moody and hardly spoke a word. The room was really nice, we had a view of the park and it was quiet and really nice.
We had a great nights sleep but I will be sticking to the doubletree as the rooms are bigger and the staff in reception make you feel more welcome. It is good if you are on business for an over night stay only."

1617,Lindylou146,2015-01-31,4.0,"Good value hotel Situated on the main road near Temple Meads station and within easy walking distance to the city centre shops. First impressions were of a simple unsophisticated hotel and a very efficient and friendly welcome from the front desk staff. The best rooms are at the back looking over the ""park"" and we usually go for a high floor as they seem quieter. The room was well furnished and although small, the bathroom was more than adequate with a good shower and quality toiletries. There was a free safe, fridge, tea and coffee and even an Apple Mac computer that doubled up as a television. I did find the bed too firm for me, but my husband slept like a log. There was a bit of confusion over the pillows, as I had requested foam instead of the feather ones. Unfortunately housekeeping didn't know the difference between the 2 and had to make several trips to our room, and even then we were left with 2 feather ones.
The package we were on included breakfast and dinner, which did not disappoint. Although we were the only ones using the restaurant between 6.30 and 8pm. The food was well cooked and presented and again the staff very attentive. Breakfast was the usual fayre and again well presented with eggs being freshly cooked and staff on hand. 
There are no real negatives for this hotel, although the parking at £12 a day could be an issue at the busy times as it is quite limited. We will definitely return to this hotel next time we are in Bristol."
1618,huttyp93,2015-01-31,4.0,"Stop for a night out stayed for the one night last weekend, easy check in, decent room my only issue was the bed was a tad small. Staff posted your folio through your door during the night so you can express check out in the morning. Breakfast was great, not only that but the lady cooking which I recall was Jane, was lovely and friendly, she was giving my girlfriend tips on how cook the prefect egg! you need staff like that, speaking from someone in Hotel management.

Hotel is also close to the town centre ( 5 minute walk ) where you can spend all day shopping  ! Parking is £12 for 24 hours which I think is fair for a city centre. Also the gym is well equipped and pretty much brand new"

Great hotel, stayed for one night and found the room to be excellent along with helpful and friendly staff. What you would expect as a frequent Hilton customer - ironing board in room, tea and coffee, complementary water and toiletries.  The in room TV was an Apple computer and had Sky Sports and full browser, very impressed with this! Good location close to main train station and still within 10 minute walk to the main centre. Only minor point for me was breakfast - scrambled egg was full of cream and almost pureed! But then again, the leisure traveller may like this but for someone who stays 3 nights a week, you get a bit sick of the full cooked breakfast."

And it is not true that if you are not satisfied you get your money back. I still have scars all over my arms from the bedbugs of hilton garden inn that is a discusting horrible hotel with arrogant manegment. that ruined our new year and we still did not get our money back

1630,wottraveller,2015-01-31,5.0,"Great Hotel, Superb Service & Excellent Food This was my first visit to the Hilton Garden Inn Bristol. After my journey by train to Temple Meads Station, the hotel is just a five minute (or less) walk away.

It is a modern design, with a bus stop outside the hotel, which takes you in to the city centre. It is also a stop for the open top bus service that runs from March to December.

I was warmly welcomed to the hotel, my Hilton HHonors silver status recognised (a nice touch) & I was in my top floor room (5th floor), within moments. I suspect this was aided by the fact that I had checked in online via the Hilton HHonors app on my phone & had chosen my exact room.

By the very nature of the building, space is at a premium, so bedrooms are compact (if you want a large bedroom space, this hotel is not for you), but more than adequately serve their purpose. A small, but well equipped bathroom, comprises a power shower, toilet & sink. In the bedroom you'll find an excellent bed, iron/ironing board, hair dryer, tea & coffee making facilities as well as an Apple Mac TV/Computer (left over from when the hotel was a City Inn/Mint Hotel). With free, workable WiFi, you could not ask for more. After all, you are not staying in the room 24/7. Two bottles of water were waiting for me in the room, in recognition of my Hilton HHonors status.

Rooms are spotless, but that has to be said for the entire hotel, which is looked after with care & attention to detail.

I had booked a dinner, bed & breakfast rate, as this served my needs. I went down to dinner at about 7.30pm, was warmly greeted & shown to a table. The restaurant had a very pleasant atmosphere & there is an adjoining bar which also serves a range of snacks.

My three-course table d'hote meals on both nights were excellent, with great portion sizes, & were chosen from a range of options offered. Food quality was superb, as was presentation. Where relevant, food was served hot, as you would expect. Beverages are not overly expensive, a plus for a city centre hotel.

Breakfast was offered buffet style, & a member of staff shows you to a table & goes through the wide range of hot & cold options on offer. There is a menu offering cooked to order dishes as well. A chef offers excellent service at a live kitchen, cooking eggs to order. Her interaction with guests is quite brilliant & is a must see if you can.

For both mornings I was there, I opted for the porridge, followed by a three egg omelette (with cheese, mushroom & tomatoes). Both were piping hot & served separately, as well as being cooked to perfection. 

Staff are very attentive, continuously bringing round a choice of tea & coffee. Nothing is too much trouble.

The hotel is located within easy reach of all that Bristol has to offer & can be reached by bus or on foot.

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, as it ticks all the boxes you may have, as well as offering very decent room rates too.

Well done to all members of staff. It's a pleasure to be looked after by such caring people."

Our rooms were great, very clean and tidy and all the things you would expect.people alway's seem to complain about hotel beds but ours were very comfortable and had a good night sleep.would definitely stay again."
1632,charlcole1,2014-02-28,3.0,"Great Location! The hotel is in such a good location. Only a few short minutes away from Temple Meads train station and a walk or very short bus ride away from the city center!

The rooms are nice. Very clean and modern but small!! The bathrooms are also small but have everything you need. The Mac TV/Computer was lovely too.

Good value for money but I wouldn't go back again purely down to the size of the rooms. But a great hotel for buisness stays /friends on a shopping trip."
1633,lillibetisqueen,2015-01-31,4.0,"second visit..better than the first! This was our return visit to the hotel, having had a poor experience the first time. However, the staff did all they could to accommodate me and my husband. I even had a lovely piece of cake in my room on arrival...very nice touch. The rooms are basic but clean. Love the Mac TV/computer...very modern. I would say that walls could do with a bit more decoration! it's all a bit bland...even if decals were applied...they wouldn't gather dust and can be removed for painting..but these are small things...my room with a twin link bed was more than adequate for my fidgety husband! Some might find the double beds not quite big enough...just a thought. The location is fairly good, if you know where you are going! The car park is tight, but we managed it ok. You will have to pay an additional fee for the pleasure although I believe you can park for free nearby!"

Pre-booked this hotel as it's on the main airport bus route to the city centre, infact it stops right outside, great when you just want to sleep! Quick check-in and headed straight to the room! It was very small and the bathroom a shoebox, everytime you pulled the flush you had to put the seat down! Adequate though for a 1 person, 1 night stop! It was clean and wasn't to sure about the iMac for a TV, it took too long to switch on. Very surprised to find mint tea among the tea/coffee selection, a big bonus for me! The bed was very comfortable indeed!"

The breakfast was as good as any that we have had in far more expensive hotels and special mention must go to the breakfast staff who were helpful and friendly, especially the lady cooking the eggs! The location is quiet with a car park next door and only a pleasant 5 to 10 minute walk into the very centre of Bristol.  We will definitely stay here again as it offers better value than other hotels that we have stayed in in Bristol."
1637,pete3837,2015-01-31,5.0,"Another nice couple of days Having previously stayed at this hotel and having a good stay we returned for another couple of days.  Location is fantastic! Close to Cabot Circus and also pubs/restaurants. It was not expensive and we got a deal that included breakfast. The room was clean, shower good and the bed comfortable. The staff are friendly and the breakfast was buffet style and tasty, good to set you up for the day. Would certainly recommend this hotel and will return when we visit our son and his wife again. Cannot comment on the car park as we leave our car at his house and he drops us at the hotel and picks us up when we go out with them."

Only criticism would be the car park which is very tight to park in and lots of vehicles almost abandoned outside designated spaces making it even more difficult to get out, which is annoying when you are being charged to park."

1646,lauzjam133,2014-12-31,4.0,Xmas trip Enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Nice clean rooms and shower room. Nice cooked buffet breakfast .staff were friendly enough.

1647,DenimGeek,2014-12-31,4.0,"Great compact but modern hotel that beats the nearby Marriott in most areas I've stayed in this hotel a couple of times recently on business and have also stayed in the nearby Marriott a few times. While this hotel doesn't have a pool and is a little further from town it is more modern and well equipped and has free wi-fi so get's my vote as the better of the two.

Rooms are not huge but have everything you need and are well laid out. The inclusion of an Apple iMac for TV, internet and computing is a great idea and a real winner with me.

The bar and restaurant are again not huge but food was very good when I stayed and service was excellent. In fact staff across the whole hotel were really friendly and helpful.

I didn't use the gym so can't comment.

Car parking is limited and while I just about managed to squeeze into the last space I'm sure those arriving later than me had to follow directions to nearby fee paying car-parks."
1648,850gabriellem,2014-12-31,3.0,Needs somethings fixed - shame as its nice Poor food quality and choice.  I wanted something light but hot - the choice was very limited - and my £12 light supper I could not finish even though I was hungry. Its a shame as the hotel is nice - well located - staff are friendly.  But The bar food needs an overhaul.  Air con kept me awake - room was cool - bathroom tiny but nice.

1650,582ac,2014-12-31,5.0,"Hilton Bristol Beautiful clean hotel.  Very pleasant obliging staff.  However, our dining experience was spoiled by 2 other guests taking our table and refusing to move after we retuned from the buffet for our main course.  Their ignorance, and no reflection on the Hilton's staff"
1651,O1168NGpaulh,2014-12-31,4.0,"An overnight stay in Bristol My wife and I stayed here as a part of a group. The hotel is conveniently placed in the city centre. We were quickly dealt with by reception and made our way to our room via the lift. The room was excellent, everything was immaculate and clean. There was all new equipment with a computer doubling up as a TV, a sophisticated radio alarm system and telephone. The bathroom was well appointed and clean. The beds were very comfortable with a choice of hard/soft pillows. Despite facing the main road we could not here a sound from the traffic due to the very efficient triple glazing. The evening meal was a buffet with a choice of soup or pate and then a choice of 3 main courses followed by a large portion of fruit salad. There was a wide choice of things for breakfast but I didn't like the coffee! I was perfectly happy with my stay at the Hilton but some other members of our group complained of some rowdy people making excessive noise from 10pm until 2am in the morning which kept them awake. However they did not complain to reception who I am sure would have sorted the problem out."
1652,221DeborahT,2014-12-31,4.0,"Small but clean and good value for money The hotel room was small with no frills but clean and functional and good value for money, the beds were fairly comfortable.  Wifi is free which is useful, and despite overlooking a very busy road we didn't hear any noise.  Very close to Temple Meads station and a bus takes you from outside the hotel to the city centre.  It is more of a business stop over hotel than a tourist destination but fine for our needs."

Rooms not very large but very nicely equiped IMacs in each room (as this serves as TV as well I can imagine this to be a bit challanging to the less technology inclined or maybe certain senior travellers). 
Very good location. Barely 10 min walk to Cabot Centre. 
If I have to provide a critique it would be the limitation of parking places at the hotel site, when special occasions are taking place. That said, the staff does direct you to a free overnight public car park around the corner. 
Definitely to be recommended."

Managed to find a parking-lot at the hotel even though we had late arrival. Note, the rooms are quite small, but clean and well equipped. No TV - but an I-Mac instead. Breakfast maybe more of a 3 star experience, but great service."

The room was modern, clean and functional but a tad on the small side. This didn't bother me particularly but may do other people.

Breakfast was good and open until 11am on Saturday morning which also fit with my plans well.

All in all, a pleasant stay for the money and would stay again."

1658,680eileena,2014-11-30,5.0,"Super hotel! Stayed over on a Saturday night, following a theatre trip to Bristol.
Hotel is south of the river, but easy walking distance to the shopping area, and also the Hippodrome theatre.
West side of the hotel faces Temple Way which is a very busy road, but our room was on west side - much quieter!
Rooms are a reasonable size and are very well equipped - an iMac in the room provides TV/radio/internet/etc. Bed was very comfortable. En-suite shower rooms are small but fine.
Parking is advertised but space is limited - we had to use the public car park behind the hotel, which actually worked out cheaper than the hotel's parking charge.
Breakfast was plentiful with plenty of choice.
Will definitely go back in the future."

Am sitting up in bed writing this having suffered the most atrocious traffic noise for most of the night.  Was given the option when booking of a double or twin room; the twin was about £20 cheaper.  Decided to go for that and hey ho, it's on the front of the hotel alongside the very busy road.  Learning point: you get what you pay for!"

It has onsite parking but it is £12 a night which was a bit of a shock on top of the room price.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The room I had was quite small but large enough for my needs so not a problem.  It was well appointed and well sound proofed.  They had Apple Macs which operated as the TV and a computer.  I struggled with the TV operation and the slim line Apple remote, but a minor point.  Free WiFi which I wish the rest of the Hilton group would offer.  The room was clean and I would stay again.

The IMac was a welcome and useful feature as was the free wifi. The chair in the room was very comfortable for desk working and after a quick google I will have to save my pennies for one! The fittings in this Hotel are 1st class Grohe, Porcelanosa, Matki &  Apple amongst others and yet the room rate I paid was very reasonable. 
Any negatives? no .. This is Bristol's Best value hotel amongst some stiff competition.

The advantage of this is that at the weekend it is quieter and you can open a window without getting the sound of Saturday night entertainment. 
We were on the park side with a view across to the ruined Temple Church. As with many Bristol hotels parking is a chargeable extra (£12) and its not a large car park - we were lucky and got the only space on a saturday afternoon. 
We had a Queen Room Park View - an upgrade (thanks!). The room was a reasonable size, had a shower but no bath, a fridge for storing goodies if you wished, free WiFi and a Mac for TV / entertainment/ info. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and we didn't hear a thing from any other guests.

The breakfasts were ok, if you like eating cold cooked breakfasts. The plates were stone cold and the food was luke warm, therefore cold by the time you reached your table. The rooms are comfortable and clean, so not all bad. Car parking very restricted. Overall, an average city hotel."

As we arrived late we decided to have food and drinks at the hotel bar. Being a vegetarian I didn’t expect much choice but to my delight I had a few options (the bean burger is to die for). We were served by a fine gentleman named Courtney who took time to speak to us.

The following morning we had breakfast in the hotel which was lovely. The lady at the egg station (Jane) was a delight and brightened up my morning with her spirit, passion and energy.

Overall the staff were friendly and attentive and my only feedback to the hotel is that the check out process was longer than I expected.

If you’re into History then Bristol is the place for you (make sure you take a comfortable pair of walking shoes with you). This hotel is situated close to the hustle and bustle of Bristol and I will be most definitely be going back to Bristol and staying in this hotel again."

He was very attentive and remembered our drinks order from the previous night.

Lovely hotel. Well lit and bright. I was given a room with a park view. Although the bathroom area is small, the room was the perfect size with a very comfortable bed. The iMac TV added a great touch to the room.

Went for Breakfast and was greeted by a lovely breakfast chef named Jane. Very happy lady, who can brighten up your morning even if yoiu wake up on the wrong side of the bed.

If you are visiting Bristol, i would highly recommend this hotel as you get more than you pay for in terms of service and the team members working there."

The air con isn't particularly cool, therefore I suggest leaving window open, although it can get noisy through the night, taxis etc. 

Staff are helpful, however always seem ran off their feet, reception is slow again always seem busy.

I had 1 morning where we stayed for breakfast however there are tasty places on the river you can pop to that have really lovely alternatives on offer for far better value.

It is centrally located within a short walk of the city centre. On arrival staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful and we experienced this for the whole of our 2 day stay - nothing was too much trouble. The room was lovely:spotless, bright, airy and comfortable with a park view. Bathroom, bed, towels and sheets spotless. Well stocked with iron, ironing board, fridge, and hairdryer etc. Buffet breakfast had choice to suit most and was presided over by more lovely, attentive and polite staff. Only tiny comment is that if the room is booked as a twin occupancy then then there should be x2 hospitality shower gel and shampoo but this is really minor as a phone call to reception would have easily rectified this.  Overall a lovely, quality hotel and I would definitely recommend and use again as they catered comfortably for all types of travellers. Well done and thank you."

I was really pleased that I could control the room temperature very easily and was able to achieve a really comfortable temperature which is rare in so many hotels.

My only (very small) criticism was that there were no biscuits with the  tea making facilities. It would have been nice to have available although there was a small shop downstairs selling snacks which I could have easily gone to.

Breakfast was the usual assortment of cereals, pastries and  hot food. Service was good.

Pretty certain the toilet was cracked but forgot to report on checkout.  iMac a novelty but TV reception on this device not the best. The hotel is a short walk away from the city centre.  Breakfast not the best. Reasonable selection but not hot. A waffle maker is provided for guests but everyone seemed to be having difficulty using it and it seemed to required a lot of staff supervision. Express checkout a handy option. Pleasant staff throughout. Would stay here again."
1682,Manxkippa,2014-07-31,4.0,"Handy location, nice comfortable hotel Stayed for one night after seeing a show in the city.

Handy to catch the river ferry from which made a nice way of getting into the harbour area and handy to catch a train from Temple Meads too.

Rooms were as expected, nice, clean and comfortable.

Excellent breakfast too!"
1683,MySloeLink,2014-11-30,4.0,"Good stay. My colleague and I booked a twin room on a Wednesday night. The hotel is very convenient for Temple Meads station and Temple Quays. It's only a ten minute or so walk from the City Centre so the location was perfect for us.

Reception was very friendly and welcoming.

The twin room was pretty pokey but clean, modern and fresh. It's a good job we knew each other well as it was difficult to get to the wardrobe on the far side of the room without having to dodge out of the way of each other. I guess a double might have a little more circulation space. The aircon was rubbish - even on its coolest setting it didn't cool down much and was a bit fuggy when we woke up. I've just reead the last four reviews and they all say the same - clearly something the management ought to sought out - when we mentioned it on check out the check out guy didn't bat an eyelid. The shower was a bit feeble, not much power or volume of water but it did the job.

Despite those issues - which given it's supposed to be a 'four' star hotel and it cost us £140 I don't expect - we had a good stay there. Staff were friendly and efficient, wifi worked well (hooray, a hotel that doesn't charge for wifi and it actually works!), the breakfast was very good (fresh, rather than all from a catering pack!) and we both had a very comfortable night's sleep. 

Will stay there again, gladly but would look for a bit of a deal on the price if I could."
1684,402dariaj,2014-10-31,4.0,"Nice Hotel I booked this hotel for one night to visit Bristol. I have booked Queen Evolution room with Park View. 

When we have arrived the staff were friendly and the hotel was very nice and modern. When we entered our room I was a little bit disappointed. The room was very small and we didn't have park view instead we had a view onto another building and a tree (wouldn't recommend it). The room had everything you needed and it was very clean the bed was very comfortable  which was a plus!

Unfortunately the air conditioning didn't work when I tried to switch it on at night. The night porter kindly got us some fans, they didn't help much as the room was very hot therefore it was impossible to sleep. Apart from that everything was brilliant especially the breakfast. I would definitely return in future."
1685,SoulfulMinx,2014-10-31,4.0,"A good choice. We stayed here for the weekend to coincide with our anniversary. I emailed ahead to request the best room available relevant to our booked preference. Upon arrival the lady on reception (surname Bennett) was very friendly and chatty and remarked on our anniversary and offered us a glass of champagne in the bar. We thought this was a nice touch, however was a little disappointed to be told once inside the bar that they had run out of Champagne. This I did not believe, it was probably more of a matter they had run out of house Champagne. Instead we were each offered a glass of wine. 

We stayed in one of the Queen Evolution Park View rooms. Admittedly the room was smaller than we expected, but it was very contemporary in it's styling. The bathroom was also on the small side, but acceptable for our short stay. The bed we thought would be too firm to enjoy a good nights sleep. However neither of us woke up with aches and pains and both had a pleasant nights sleep. The linen was of a good quality and spotlessly clean. We also liked the Mac TV/Computer set up. The air con in the room didn't seem to work, it made a noise but didn't seem to do much else. However, we didn't have the need to fully utilise this and therefore didn't hinder our stay. 

We paid for breakfast to be included. Breakfast had a vast selection of hot and cold options. However, be careful of the sausages, I had 3 sausages and 1 was raw.

Don't overlook the hotel website when booking this hotel. We found a better on their website compared to what the likes of booking.com etc were offering.

Should we go back to Bristol, we wouldn't rule out a return stay here."
1686,151Mike151,2014-11-30,4.0,"Bright and Light Hotel It occurred to me on this visit just how bright but also easy on the eye this hotel is, no dark paint, no shadowy corridors, very pleasantly lit. Women particularly might feel comfortable with the decor.
Others mention the convenient positioning of this hotel, near Temple Meads rail station.Visitors armed with a pass will find buses are in abundance and stop right outside the hotel, taking you into the centre of town. We travelled in to the hotel by bus from Devizes and find the Hilton Garden Inn hotel great for us.
Breakfast, buffet style - one of the best, the fruit is mouth watering and fresh. Hot dishes are well catered for though as with any busy hotel dishes require constant topping up, patience again.
One thing should be considered by management is the `pathways` staff use to get to the kitchen, because they cross over the very same that persons use when attempting to reach the foods.
Must mention that these staff work extremely hard and are very good at giving you what you want and clearing `done` dishes. The `Breakfast` manager, again there last year, is so cheerful, inviting and well organised.
Did not have evening meal so cannot comment.
Bedroom -  Air Con, could blow a little colder. Windows, you can open them, great if you're claustraphobic like me.
En-suite - was sparkling clean. The shower was perhaps the safest we've used, floor is as it should be, non-slip. Room 515.
Staff - it was noticeable that staff at Reception, and serving in the Breakfast area were working here a year ago, perhaps a sign that management has got it right.
Reception - at times very busy, this is a bustling vibrant hotel, so patience and tolerance is often required by visitors and staff. Receptionists are multi-lingual."
1687,Pughy3,2014-10-31,4.0,"Great Stay I booked this hotel for a one night city break so that my wife and I could do some Xmas shopping and also enjoy the night life bars in the evening and we weren't disappointed.  I looked at many hotels within the same vicinity and this hotel was very well priced with easy parking (At a small cost). The shopping areas and nightlife are within a couple of miles walk.
The reception staff were very welcoming and booked us in to our room even though we were 2 hours early. The room was well fitted out with a fridge and Apple entertainment system and Safe, the bed was very comfortable and we had a great nights sleep. The breakfast was great and the breakfast staff were all very friendly and helpful. There was an excellent good quality choice at breakfast and I would thoroughly recommend dining here for your breakfast.   
We had a great stay and all the staff were great. We will definitely stay here again. 
Many Thanks"
1688,AmberW2031,2014-11-30,4.0,Great service room very hot! It's the first time I've stayed here and must say was very impressed with the customer service from reception and the 2 male bar staff that were on (we stayed Halloween) room was lovely and clean but very very hot! We had to sleep with the windows open and air con on just to try and keep cool. Great hotel though
1689,joypat,2014-10-31,5.0,"Loved this  hotel I arrived last Friday evening to meet with an old friend and have a catch up visit, the reception staff were a tad distant, but, helpful. The room was well appointed, although a bathtub would have been most welcome. We were not offered an upgrade, as requested at the time of booking, so we soldiered on, but, the breakfast was fabulous and the atmosphere was very relaxed with outdoor  dining offered for smokers as an option. 
We were greeted by a very helpful and friendly staff in the bar/dining room by a very welcoming yung man, named Peotr who concocted for us two delicious cocktails and attended to our needs with the utmost professionalison as one would expect from any 5 star hotel.nhe was friendly and helpful.  Our second evening was delightful with a lovely meal served by a smiling lady by the name of Grace, who had us giggling in no time, and served us a sumptuous meal, it was a wonderful weekend, with lots of laughs and giggles , thanks to the serving staff in the bar and dinng room, many thanks, we had a lovely time"
1690,Nommle,2014-10-31,5.0,"Very impressed. Best hotel breakfast I think I've ever had. We stayed on the weekend of 25th and 26th and the lady cooking the fried eggs (both mornings) was a phenomenal human being! Rooms and service etc. All good, couldn't fault this experience."
1691,sazanneannne,2014-10-31,4.0,"It Fits The Bill This hotel is a little off from the main centre but as it is so close to the Temple Meads Station it is ideal for all modes of transport . Check in was easy and the rooms although small are clean  and after all when you are a tourist you are not spending all your time in a bedroom. It was an added bonus to have an onsite guest laundry as well. 
  The buffet breakfast is quite good but it is two young ladies at the front desk Lucy and Adele
who really demonstrated the service one comes to expect from a Hilton hotel. As we were unable to process our boarding passes (as we are not comfortable with doing that) they went out of their way to accommodate us by taking care of it for us even though it is usually the job of the guests. This was done with both efficiency and a courtesy. Well done!"
1692,missChow,2014-10-31,4.0,"Good but not great For a Hilton with 4 stars I was expecting a little more for the price paid. It's quiet but not in the city centre, it takes some 10-15min walking via a garden (scary at night but found ok in daylight) or via isolated roads with cars but few people.
Amenities were good quality, size of the room small, wireless worked ok wich is refreshing for a hotel, and free!
Breakfast in a small room but sufficient for the number of guests and with enough choices and nice service from staff. Reception was very helpfull. Parking was full but found that other cars find a way to park outside the normal areas, which is tolerated, so there are more spaces than the ones one would think. Also possible to park outside for free on Sundays, so one can save for a cider in the local pub :)"

1694,ccr_harris,2014-10-31,3.0,Generally a good venue I was generally pleased with my stay here but found the room was too hot despite the heating/cooling system being on the coldest setting.  I felt the system was out-of-date and wasn't really air-conditioning.
1695,281pedroa,2014-10-31,4.0,"Apart from shower water pressure, very good. The hotel, overall is very nice. Well located, we walked from the hotel to everywhere in Bristol. The breakfast is brilliant as well as the staff. They did helped us with every questions we had during our stay.  The rooms are a bit too small, at least for a twin room, but well equipped and clean.   The bathroom is also clean, well equipped but we had a water pressure issue, and in the end the water simply stop running at all."
1696,Margy65,2014-10-31,5.0,Fabulous 1 night stay We booked our 1 night stay with a third party.  When checking in I was asked if we were members of Hilton Rewards. My husband said he was and they immediately put the points to his account.  Our room was very comfortable and the shower was excellent.  The breakfast was great and the staff very quick on removing empty plates.  Will definitely stay here again

1698,GAR8171,2014-10-31,5.0,"Personnel Service Having stayed at many hotels across the UK I have experienced both the highs and lows of customer service over a 5 year period.So I am well qualified to judge both people and the permises ( in my opinion :)).
Have stayed at this hotel over the last few months and it clearly demonstrates 'best practise' in many areas.Accommodation,food and facilities tick all the boxes but its the people factor that stands out above all the rest.
i was priveleged to witness the restaurant and bar staff's genuine duty of care with a non sighted guest over 2 late dinners.Nothing was too much trouble and it was humbling to see such sincere professionalism.
So well done to Paulo,Alex,Juan and Aga who have excelled in customer care and should be recognized for their efforts.
I do not usually write reviews but this team were exceptional to say the least.
Following on from last week I discussed the introduction of alternate 'real ales' from the local area as the lager range are not my choice (its an acquired taste!) with Courtney ( a learned student of beer) from behind the bar.Thank you for refreshing attitude to further improve the Hilton experience.
Pat on the back for the Hilton team at Bristol .Many thanks Graham Ryall"
1699,chuck1es,2014-10-31,5.0,"Great Hotel, Great Staff Only stayed one night whilst visiting Bristol recently but was very impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Breakfast was great too and it had a lively and buzzy atmosphere. Would happily recommend."
1700,Vixyc88,2014-10-31,5.0,"Great Hotel & exceptional staff I booked a stay via a travel agent rate which I frequently use and was due to stay in November, when i booked this it was non refundable and non changeable. Due to getting a new job and the training overlapping I needed to see if i could see the dates. I contacted the hotel prior to travel and spoke to both Maz and Kriztina who went above and beyond to assist in this matter and are most certainly a credit to both the hilton and the hotel. Prior to arrival I had mentioned it was to celebrate my Mams Birthday on arrival they had placed us a lovely cake and complimentary vouchers for a drink in the bar, a very lovely touch. The lady on reception Annie couldn't have done more to help during our stay and was always on hand to help. The hotel is fairly easy to get too from the hotel with the airport bus stopping directly outside the airport and dropping off right outside the hotel, this is £11 return and an easy journey. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk out of the main centre and Cabot Circus. The rooms are nice, comfortable, very clean and were the usually Hilton standards, the toiletries in the bathroom are also a nice touch and every room has an I-mac which are good for a bit tv / music. The rooms aren't huge but they are all you need for a stay, we had 2 chairs in our room and in all honest would probably have been better with 1 as this took up quite a bit of space. The only negative point was when we arrived we had a problem getting our toilet to flush, we did mention this on our way out and the girl on reception said she would send someone to have a look, when we returned it appeared to the be the same, it did not spoil our stay but it was a little annoying. We opted for breakfast for our stay and very glad we did, there was a vast choice, staff were very friendly, food was delicious and there is also fresh eggs and a waffle maker available. The wifi was also free and really useful.Overall the hotel was great, and the staff are a real credit to the place. I would recommend this hotel and would stay again."

1703,sandrac58,2014-10-31,4.0,"A weekend Away My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, on checking in the staff were very friendly, helpful and polite. We were allocated a room on the 4th floor looking out onto the main road. Even though it was a busy main road, the room was very quiet. We had a twin room, with fridge and safe, very comfortable beds, crisp white bed linen, and very comfy pillows. There was a large chair in the bedroom, which we had to keep moving around to get to the wardrobe. Our toilet was not flushing properly, we did report this to reception, but it was not fixed whilst we had the room, however as we didnt spend a lot of time in the hotel, it did not spoil anything, it was just an irritation. The breakfasts were very good, lots of choice and, served hot. With eggs cooked to order. The staff in the restaurant were all very nice and polite. One lady in particular, who worked on reception, was so lovely, I think her name was Annie Lundgren, she took an interest in where we had been sightseeing, gave us loads of hints and tips, helped us with buses, she was very knowledgeable. And she certainly went out of her way to do all she could to make our stay a good one. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. It was only 10 minutes walk to the central promenade and to Cabot Circus."

The staff was very welcoming at reception, first impressions are very important and this was already a good sign. The lady at the bar was very kind as well, she recognised us at breakfast from the evening before, which means a lot as they see many guests. The public areas and the room was very clean and modern. Next to that, we had free internet and a iMac in the room, which is a unique experience. The bar had a lot of atmosphere and breakfast was delicious. No complaints at all. Highly recommended to everybody! Definitely coming back soon."

Staff on reception and in the restaurant were all very friendly and attentive. Hotel was clean and bright throughout. 
Breakfast buffet was good with items often not found in hotel breakfasts, like 'proper' sausages and a waffle maker. Staff were always on hand to top up hot drinks. 
Would recommend if you're happy to be a bit out of the hustle and bustle of the city centre."

I made use of the fast checkout service which had the option of having the invoice sent to an email address. Despite requesting this, I still had not received my email one week on and I had to phone the hotel to request it."

1716,kathrynjc,2014-09-30,4.0,"Business trip Have stayed at this hotel twice for business trips, most recently in mid-September. The hotel is incredibly close to Temple Meads station which is very convenient, although it does mean that it's slightly further from the shops and restaurants than other places.

Check-in was efficient and quick. The rooms are very clean and modern with an Apple TV/computer which is useful if you need to work. The rooms have fridges, which is a rare and appreciated commodity, as well as lovely toiletries in the bathrooms. The bed is also high up and exceptionally comfy. Only downside is that the windows don't open (or at least mine didn't appear to) and the air conditioning isn't that effective.

Only had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and it was fine. Nothing truly exceptional aside from the waffles. The bar looked nice but wasn't that big so can't imagine relaxing in there for too long. The meeting room facilities were excellent and staff were very helpful.

All in all it was an excellent place to stay for what we needed and I wouldn't hesitate to go back."

The rooms are nice but ours was dusty with rings left on glass shelves smears on mirrors left me with the feeling it wasn't cleaned properly . The room lights (bedside) weren't plugged in and I couldn't untangle them to plug them in ,the night light didn't work .all these are details that make it a 4star and should be in place , a good housekeeper should stand in the room after cleaning and ask her self would a guest find the more comfortable than home could they navigate around in the dark . Overnight parking was 12.50 and the hotels spaces are in an adjoining NCP it's difficult to navigate from this to the hotel reception .we were offered a special deal for the evening meal £20 inc wine ,we would liked to have read through the menu in our room ,but there wasn't any menus in the room , or magazines or any other Bristol literature ,I've never experienced that in  a city centre hotel .this hotel needs to try a lot harder ,I was visiting on a complimentary night ,with them because I had complained previously .about an Xmas party booking ,they haven't  improved at all ..sorry to say ."

1721,Lynteacher,2014-09-30,4.0,"Good but slightly spoiled by a hen party We stayed at this hotel as a couple for my birthday. The hotel is located only a few minutes away from the centre of the city so it is easy to walk to the attractions. The room was lovely and had all the facilities we needed. We thought the breakfast was fantastic and the service there was very good. All the staff we met were very friendly and efficient. 

Unfortunately. when we arrived to check-in a large hen party of around 30 people was also checking in. They were very noisy at this time and a little noisy during the night. The staff did their best to check everyone in as efficiently as possible but the lobby was crowded and we had to queue for a little while. They had also plastic glasses for champagne, which were left lying around broken outside (but were cleaned up quickly). Obviously the prospect of the noise and disruption slightly spoiled the rest of our stay. I think that knowing hen/stag parties are allowed at the hotel would make us slightly reluctant to stay here again or recommend it just in case we were unlucky enough to experience it again. My partner was also disappointed the usual Hilton cookies or fudge were not available on check-in. These are the reasons I have only given the hotel 4 stars. 

Tips for things to do
We ate at an Italian restaurant called Bella Vista, which was less than 10 mins from the hotel on the river and had a fantastic evening."

1726,833sue,2014-09-30,1.0,"Ideal for stag and hen parties! Was booked into this hotel for Saturday 13the September (50 birthday treat).  Arrived to a group of 4 (men) playing football outside main entrance with a golf ball whilst swigging from a bottle of vodka and cans.  Had to then sit in reception for half an hour whilst upwards of 20 hens checked in.  During this time the golf ball kept hitting the glass door of the hotel which alongside the noise from both inside and out made us very uneasy about our upcoming stay.  The 'stags' then proceeded to their 5th floor room, one very nearly vomitting whilst waiting for the lift.  Once my partner checked in I was mortified to find we were on 5th floor and then even more mortified to find we were next door to stag do which was clearly audible from corridor.  We did not even open room door but rather returned to reception.  The lady at reception was incredibly helpful and offered us another room on 5th floor which we would have to wait half an hour for.  Given two rooms on 5th floor were taken up with stag do we were not keen on this idea.  Next offered 4th floor but informed most of hen party on this floor 'and they were worse than the boys'.  By this time we had lost the will to check in at all and so cancelled the reservation and left.  I realise no hotel can be responsible for its quests behavious but to allow people to check in swigging alcohol and obviously drunk at 4 oclock in the afternoon is surely asking for trouble.  As I said the lady at reception tried to accommodate us even offering to try and book us at another Hilton, however by this time we really had seen enough and decided we were better off at home."
1727,iluvholidays33,2014-08-31,3.0,"Room was pleasant but smaller than expected. I stayed at this hotel on 28th August 2014. We arrived before our check out time which was meant to be 3.00. I had booked through last minute.com and requested an earlier check in. When we got there they seemed to be quite behind with the cleaning of the rooms and hadn't really made any effort to try and accommodate the request made through last minute.com. However the receptionist said she would sort the problem and to sit in the cafe and she will let us know when our room would be ready in about 30 minutes. We were pleased with this but after about 1 hour waiting in the cafe i went back to reception and the lady had gone and someone new was there who said was very unlikely. After explaining my frustrations after about another 20/30 minutes we were shown to our room. 

One of the 2 lifts was being repaired and so the wait was long, as we were on floor 2 and only had an over night bag we took the stairs which was fine.
The room was so much smaller and darker than advertised in the picture. This was very disappointing as the picture on the website was stunning. I have attached their picture and then mine.

I am sure if i hadn't seen the picture i wouldn't have been so disappointed but i was and the bathroom was incredibly small. As small as what you may have as a downstairs bathroom. You definitely couldn't fit more than one person at a time.

All of this aside, the room was quiet and we had a park/garden view which was lovely, much nicer than the other side which was a road and a carpark. Bed was very comfy. Room was a little warm and the air con which we had to keep on sounded like a helicopter landing in the room.

The TV was a mac computer which was ok, maybe a bit difficult for some people to use but it did the job.

A good location, we managed a walk into down and a ferry back which is the best way to travel.
I would say if you were travelling alone this room would be ideal. For a couple a little small.

I have to say however they did give us an extra hour free late check out. I think it should have been £15 per hour after 12.00."
1728,NickTip124,2014-07-31,4.0,Good Value Comfortable Stay Have stayed here when hosting an evening for work colleagues on a few occasions. The hotel is very adequate for a budget stay and is well situated being a walk through the park from the entrance to the City centre. Breakfast was ordinary so probably best to step out for breakfast. Parking on site for a small charge is definite plus.
1729,janiceb988,2014-09-30,5.0,"WEEKEND STAY As this hotel is within easy walking distance of Bristol Temple Meads Railway Station we decided to book for a weekend stay.  We found this hotel to be  modern, clean and the staff are helpful, efficient  and friendly.

1730,McNals,2014-09-30,5.0,"I like it I was surprised, yes the hotel is basic but not as basic as you might think if you read some of the reviews.  Rooms are clean and well equipped,  my room was very comfortable. The location is central, the fitness room functional and the staff were anything but impersonal,  they were very pleasant and very helpful. I like it and will stay again."

1732,j0j0expl0rer,2014-06-30,3.0,Clean and comfortable in central location Good sized room all newly decorated. Got this hotel for a good price so pleased with overall value. Bar area a bit non eventful but ok. We eat in bar a few times. Food average to good....Wifi didn't work grist in room. Breakfast good with plenty of usual choices. Stuff friendly and helpful.
1733,DavidGlasgow2802,2014-08-31,2.0,"Standard, impersonal business hotel Extractor fan noisy all night and I had to move room the next day. Reception staff begrudgingly gave me another room. Noise level was a bit better. Only one lift worked so I regularly had to use stairs. Room is small with a desk chair and a swivel chair squeezed into a really small space. Shower went from freezing to scalding every 30 seconds.

This is a business hotel. I wouldn't recommend for tourists."
1734,ChrisGB1981,2014-09-30,3.0,"Standard This is as the title suggests, about as standard as you can get. I would say on balance for the Hilton brand is a little below the usual quality. Although the staff and facilities are all ok there is nothing particuarly nice about the hotel. The bar is particuarly lacking in any sort of character at all. I would recommend choosing Double Tree just down the road, generally the same price and much nicer place."
1735,17StevenM,2014-09-30,4.0,"Modern and convenient hotel. I stayed here while in Bristol for a business meeting.  Booking was simple, staff were all friendly and the rooms were modern, clean and had all the amenities you could want like Apple PC, tea/coffee and iron.  Just be aware that the rooms have showers and no bath.  Not a concern for me but may be for others.  I had a garden facing room which was good as they face to the back away from the busy road so consider this when booking.  In short central, clean and modern hotel in Bristol which meets you needs very well."
1736,crockedSomerset,2014-08-31,4.0,"Modern Hotel Hilton Gardens, is a very modern Hotel right in the middle of Bristol, its bedrooms are clean well appointed with every thing you need for a good nights sleep, it seems to be popular with all male and female groups, being very close to the city centre. Breakfast was lovely sat out side on the terrace, car parking is limited but there is a public park just over the road, free for hotel guess overnight, would recommend this hotel."
1737,evansrs1982,2014-08-31,4.0,"Good clean, tidy base location for Bristol City Centre Stayed in a couple for one night on Saturday night. Hotel was full, a number of hen and stag groups were staying, but these didm't spoil our stay. We had a room at the end of a corridor which may have avoided passing traffic overnight. We also had a room on the back of the hotel, I think they refer to it as a ""garden view"" and we found this to be very quiet. We may have got this due to our HHonors Gold status which was recognised through the free breakfast. We did have to surrender the 750 points we would've earned but I'd rather the breakfast which is valued at £15 per person. Wouldn't have paid this for the breakfast, but it was very nice to have it (cooked English breakfast). Rooms are well appointed with Apple Mac used as the TV. Connected to JBL speaker system which you can play music through when getting ready for a night out. Shower pressure a bit poor, but ok for a one night stay. Air conditioning in the room was ok. Didn't manage to get it properly cold, but it wasn't as hot last weekend so we were comfortable.
Rooms are small, but ok for 2 people. We had friends round for pre-night out drinks and it was a bit cosy with 4 people in.
Car parking space is limited and expensive at £12 for 24 hours. We went for it, but there are little alternative choices. Left the car in the car park on the Sunday to walk to Cabot Circus and utilise the full 24 hours.
Through no fault of the hotel, BOTH lifts were out of order. I saw some elderly residents struggling down the stairs on Sunday morning. We are young, fit and healthy and were thankful for our level 1 room. 
Would recommend staying at the HGI Bristol City Centre. A Clean, tidy, well priced hotel for the facilities."
1738,48gillianj,2014-08-31,3.0,"Good location. The hotel is in a good location, handy for the train station and a short walk to the city. We travelled as part of an organised coach trip. Our evening meal was fairly standard fare and not as good as breakfast which was well stocked with good quality sausages and bacon. There was an adequate choice of fruit, cereals and pastries.
Unfortunately, neither lift was working from Saturday evening and still wasn't working when we left on Sunday afternoon. Being on the third floor and having an elderly relative (83) with me made things very difficult. Staff on reception did apologise when I raised it with them but no help was offered regarding luggage etc."
1739,profshanku,2014-08-31,5.0,"Great location and excellent hospitality This is a relatively new hotel very close to the Bristol Temple Meads station. If you go out by the side entrance, just walk to the big round-about and take the major road on the right which lands you at the entrance of the hotel.
Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are clean (although somewhat on the smaller side) and housekeeping does a VERY good job. Rooms have an Apple Mac that serves as TV as well as computer. Breakfast had quite a few choices and dinner was also good.

Definitely will stay here again if I visit Bristol."
1740,Austral1a,2014-08-31,4.0,"Well located, clean and comfortable We chose this hotel for it's location, self/guest/coin laundry facility and onsite self parking.

The room was clean, albeit very small - however for 2 nights and the price it was just fine.  The greeting at reception was excellent, and we were well looked after during our stay.

The food in the restaurant was ok, but not great.  We chose not to eat there on the second night and a we found an Italian place a short walk through the park opposite the hotel, it was great.

Breakfast was ok, some cooked to order items were available, we enjoyed those."
1741,jamesfwhite,2014-08-31,5.0,"Hotel Visit Excellent hotel, that met up my needs. I would stay again. The food was great, hotel very clean and the staff very very friendly and professional. Car parking is easy and it is located very near the station and local shops and restaurants."

1743,AlanKLeeds,2014-08-31,4.0,"Still good, but not the same as when it was City Inn It's many years since we stayed here, when it was the City Inn. It's since been a Mint, and now a Hilton.

The good news: it still has the same ambience - clean, smart (albeit small) rooms with an Apple Mac for TV, surfing, films, etc. The staff were helpful and friendly.

The less good news: what made the City Inn special was the outstanding quality of the food. The food is still good, but not as good as the old days. However, we had a good rate that included breakfast and evening meal. The other downside (apart from a shortage of parking which cost £12 per day) is the bland wall-paper music that plays continuously in the lobby."
1744,emmajoanne,2014-08-31,4.0,"Hen Do  We arrived at the hotel at around 11 on Saturday morning.  The car park is quite small but we managed to find space for our two cars.  3 out of our 4 rooms were ready when we arrived which was great for us as we could freshen up. The rooms are quite standard and nothing special but they were clean which is the main thing, there are imacs in the room instead of tvs and very nice toiletries in the bathroom.  The beds are comfy, however I would recommend bringing your own pillows they are very hard and about half the size of a normal pillow?? At breakfast they wouldn't accommodate us in the main breakfast room as there were 8 of us even though they could have moved tables instead we shoved out in the bar area which meant we had to walk past people waiting to sit down to get our breakfast.  Breakfast was average, what you expect from a hotel breakfast. All in all a nice hotel and a good location from the centre. The only downfall is the reception staff- not too friendly and seem a little robotic."
1745,JollyJR,2014-08-31,4.0,"Great location This is a relatively new hotel with modern facilities. Particularly liked the Apple Mac as standard in the room. Breakfast was OK not really up to the Hilton standard, seemed a bit rushed and not well stocked. Overall the staff were friendly and approachable. Pleasant stay at a good rate . Would stay here again"
1746,margaretp364,2014-08-31,4.0,"One night only Staying for one night only I was pleased that the room was on the first floor near to the lift, but attention needs to be given to the lift door as it closes with some force and does not give much time to get in and out especially with luggage.
The room was well appointed and clean.
The evening meal was a 'hot' buffet. The roast potatoes were not very hot neither were they crispy, and as with a lot of hotels the vegetables seemed that they had been plunged quickly in hot water and put into the serving tureens. I do like my vegetables cooked.
Breakfast was excellent, a good choice of all sorts of foods.
Would I stay here again? Yes."

1749,chriswC4831XE,2014-08-31,4.0,Good Business Hotel Enjoyed a brief stay at this hotel.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Close to the City Centre.  Parking was a bit tight so if arriving later make sure that you have this covered.  Quiet hotel.  A bit puzzled by the iMac in the room - instructions were a bit vague - would have preferred a straightforward TV but perhaps that makes me a ludite!!
1750,Imeck,2014-08-31,3.0,"Serviceable, but fine I used to live in Bristol and decided to stop over in the City as part of a longer trip - this was a fairly last minute booking (am Hilton Diamond so chain of choice).  The location is relatively central, but the hotel does sit on a main road and is not in one of the nicer/older parts of Bristol but an easy walk to most of the City. The biggest issue on arrival was lack of parking with few other choices nearby - luckily a car left and I grabbed their slot, but paid a hefty price for the privilege! 
Rooms are relatively small and in need of a refresh, but I did get a higher floor at the back so that was fine and fairly quiet (late Friday night) although the room was hot and I needed to keep window open. 
Breakfast on Saturday morning was very busy and the buffet ran out of various items while I was trying to get served - I did spot a not so silver service event - the 'chef' bringing out supplies of baked beans noticed some spillage on the rim of the dish, so kindly used his finger to swipe them back in with the rest of them!! 
This hotel is fine, but I'm not sure for anyone spending more than a day or so in Bristol this would be the ideal base - definitely felt more like an overnight place. I also noticed that pricing varies - room was £129 when I booked relatively last minute, I've seen other reviewers with much lower prices so I think my rating/review reflects this."
1751,AlanMarch,2014-08-31,4.0,"Great for Old Bristol Hotel was nicely located to explore the older part of central Bristol. It's about a 10 minute walk into the city one way and 10 minutes the other way to Bristol Temple Meads station. There is a nice park close by with a ruined church just by a few old pubs that were well worth a visit, full of real character. Rooms were clean and comfortable with modern appliances. Attentive staff on check-in, the fudge brownies on the check-in desk were a nice touch. Good choice for breakfast in a nice light airy restaurant. £73 for one night with breakfast was reasonable."
1752,UKRatty,2014-08-31,4.0,"Perfect for our purposes Needed a well located reasonably priced room for 1 night and this suited us well. Good clean room with very good facilities, Decent breakfast. Parking a bit of a problem - not enough spaces and expensive."

Requested a quiet room and was placed on the back of the hotel which was good.  Room small but very well equipped with tea/coffee making facilities, iron, free wifi and a large screen Apple Mac.  There was also a safe and fridge which could be stocked with your favourite items from reception.  Breakfast was also included in the price and offered a wide variety of hot and cold options. Beds were extremely comfortable and offered and excellent nights sleep.   Staff were very friendly - would definitely consider staying at this hotel again"
1754,William_Robert,2014-07-31,3.0,"Hospitable but .... Stayed there on business for one night in early July. Check in was OK, receptionist rang us about 20 mins after to make sure everything was OK which was a nice touch. The room itself was clean and adequate but not ""spacious"" as described on the website. The Apple media centre was a nice touch although the TV picture was blurry which was probably due to the graphics card.  On the minus side the bathroom door would not lock and it took several goes to flush the toilet. £12 for car parking is also excessive. Can't comment on the food as we ate out. Would probably stay there again."
1755,MartsAndMarts,2014-08-31,3.0,"Pleasant enough The best points about this hotel are its location (especially with the new Temple Quay development and short cut to Temple Meads) and its very friendly staff. The breakfast was reasonable although only served until 10am on weekdays. The tea and coffee was sat stewing on a table and the tea tasted of coffee. Would be better if hot water was provided with tea bags. 

The less good points were the street noise on Saturday night (even on the top floor) and some early morning maintenance work. The room was also not as comfortable as it could have been - pretty small with an out of proportion 'princess and the pea' type bed and two chairs taking up space. As leisure travellers, we would also have preferred a proper TV which you could turn off from the bed to the iMac."
1756,SarahclaireLondon,2014-08-31,5.0,"Amazing nights sleep, food, staff and value for money We are very well travelled and one of things that we often find is that no matter good a hotel is, the noise can be unbearable from late nighters or early risers ... or the cleaners!! This hotel is the ONLY hotel WORLD WIDE, that we have stayed in, ranging from Africa to Borneo to Thailand to India etc... where the cleaners start cleaning at a reasonable time and you cannot hear a bean when you are in your room!! It is immaculate too.The food is brilliant value for money, particularly the set dinner; the staff - are so helpful, it is like something out of a book ... I am reluctant to rave too much, in case they get a huge influx and we cannot book again! But, we stayed here in July for and then back in August ... that's how amazing it is!"
1757,Harrogate_Folk,2014-08-31,5.0,"Modern, fresh and everything worked! Good Location, very close to station, ferries, range of restaurants and the shops but no intrusive noise.

It's a modern bright airy building with clean, light and well equipped rooms.  Having reliable WiFi was a blessing as well as the use of a large screen MAC!  In room safe large enough for my laptop and other valuables was a bonus.

Bathroom had all the facilities one would want including good shower.

Did not eat there so cannot comment on the food.

The reception staff were all pleasant and efficient

It made for a relaxing long weekend - shame about the weather but you cannot blame the hotel for that!"

1759,nicolaw190,2014-08-31,3.0,"Mixed review Overall the hotel was great.  Rooms were clean and had everything you might want.  The staff were friendly and location fab.  Our first night was very peaceful.  The second evening a group of boys checked in (stag do?) and were extremely noisy shouting and slamming doors.  The staff at reception were excellent when we asked to be moved, fearing what they might be like in the early hours of the morning!  However, our new room was next to the lift so we spent all night listening to the lift mechanism.  So a real mixed bag - can't blame the hotel for the other guests and they dealt with our request really well.  However, they did have other hen/stag groups staying there too so if that's not your thing I might think twice about this place.  Suggestion for the mgt team - perhaps have a quiet floor or co locate large groups on the same floors?"
1760,smittenkittens,2014-08-31,5.0,"Delightful bargain Booked on receipt of a Summer Sale email and so glad we did! Although we weren't meant to be able to check in until after 3pm, we arrived at 10am to park up for the day and head over to the Balloon Fiesta. Welcomed by a very nice receptionist who was happy to let us check in straightaway. Our room was spotless with perhaps the largest bed we've ever slept in! Breakfast was lovely with lots to choose from. Only recommendation is to enhance Express checkout by including car park pass. Looking forward to booking another bargain soon."

Our rooms were spacious airy and spotless , made all the better that each room had an iMac computer which went down very well indeed with our teenage daughters  the food was delicious  , the big hit  and making your own waffles for breakfast how fresh was that , but they also had  loads of other choices to suit everyone else's needs and taste buds. The only downside to our stay was having to leave , bristol has loads to offer and we will definitely be back even if it's only to stay in the hotel and never leave ,"

1763,johngX5415LA,2014-08-31,2.0,"A Middling experience Quite well located for getting around the local amenities.

Free wifi in the rooms, however the connection dropped literally every 30 seconds, on every device I tried to connect, and so was next to useless.

The bed was too hard, as a result I did not sleep very well on the 2 nights I stayed at the hotel.

The tea/coffee had not been restocked since the previous occupants departure, something I didn't realise until early the next morning when trying to make a morning cuppa. So I had to go without until I ventured into the city centre.

The parking was £12 per day too, which I found quite expensive. I think I could have managed to get cheaper parking using publicly available car parks. There were not enough parking bays to fit all of the cars in, we managed to squeeze the car in a non designated bay however.

This is the kind of place you stay in if you are not planning on spending very much time at the hotel."
1764,CAStead,2014-07-31,5.0,"Lots of great things about this hotel.   The location of this holt is great as it's halfway between Bristol Temple Meads Station and the Cabot Circus Shopping Centre.

It's a modern bright airy building and the rooms are well equipped eg air con, fridge, iron, safe, facilities to make drinks and the highlight for me an iMac with a large screen to use as a TV.

The bed was huge with crisp white sheets and loads of pillows. It was quiet too which resulted in a great night's sleep.

In the morning I enjoyed a hot powerful shower and followed this up with a hearty breakfast in the very pleasant dining room. There was a great choice of food from fresh fruit and cereal to a full English breakfast. It was all available from the buffet although there was also the option to order other dishes eg kippers or smoked salmon and egg.

All the staff I encountered were pleasant, helpful and efficient.

Only stayed one night as I was on a work related trip to Bristol but on the basis of this visit I would definitely stay here again."

the room was spotless clean.  Air conditioning superb (very necessary in the heat we have recently been enjoying). The hotel was also of four star quality in mine and my friends' view.
Limited choice at dinner but staff very helpful and we were happy with the alternative main course offered.  Overall a very very pleasant stay and if in Bristol again we would definitely
choose the Hilton Garden Inn."

1770,CatherineG128,2014-07-31,2.0,"Really for a one night business stay We spent three nights here during our recent tour.  The weather was very hot and humid and our room on the 4th floor was rather small and stuffy.  The air conditioning was noisy and when we opened the window the noise from the traffic was not at all pleasant nor was the noise of the seagulls.  The room wasnot ready when we arrived at around 3,30pm and we had to wiat over 30 minutes before we were taken up tpo the room by a staff member, they couldn't provide us with a key card for the room as the computer was down and so we had to ask a member of staff to let us in until the computer was finally up and running again.  We had B&B plus our evening meal on each evening.  The breakfast was OK but the evening meal was poor, my husband found hairs in the meatballs we were served as a main course.  The hotel appears tobe geared to lokking after business people who only want B&B."
1771,PompeyTony,2014-07-31,4.0,"Some pre-arrival problems but ultimately a very good stay 2 e-mails went unanswered followed by a slightly fractious phone call via the Hilton Worldwide customer service centre didn't exactly bode well for our first visit to the Hilton brand.

However, my pre-arrival requests which included an earlier check in were met and our first visit to a Hilton hotel was a very positive experience. Good, standard size room which fitted all our requirements - good bed, quiet position, in room safe and excellent bathroom facilities. Only a shower is offered which suits us perfectly but if you do this the shower system must be of a sufficient standard which this most certainly was.

For those arriving by train the hotel is in an excellent position for those who don't mind the walk - it is only about  10 minutes or so. Tip: Leave Temple Meads station by the exit marked 'Temple Quay', walk down the path, turn left into 'Friary' and walk to the end to join Temple Way. This cuts out out a fair chunk of the walk including a cobbled section outside the other exit. 

The pre-arrival problem above was addressed during our stay and following completion of a standard hotel online survey - got a personal response from the hotel which I wasn't expecting.

An excellent stay in a very good hotel but please, please answer your e-mails. I hope our next experience in the new Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo is equally as good - we have waived our favourite London Hotel to try this and hope we don't regret our decision!!"
1772,Kellie321,2014-07-31,2.0,"Not as expectation had led. Had booked a grand double room overlooking garden, however the room we got given was a small twin overlooking the road, when going back to reception desk were told they had sold out of rooms and the only other one they had available was a small double still overlooking the road. All very clean and okay, though the room only had one towel. Also, may seem obvious to other people, but could not get the mac in the room to work."
1773,peterwT4518JB,2014-07-31,5.0,"business trip good hotel, centrally located off main road into Bristol, very near floating harbour.  Good amenities, including free internet and Mac computer in room.  Got the dinner bed and breakfast deal for £119 which was pretty good"
1774,994gabrielles,2014-07-31,4.0,"Good value-short walk from the centre of Bristol Our room was quite compact, but adequate with a Queen size bed.  The room was very clean and the furnishings and facilities were very good e.g. bathroom toiletries/iron and tea/coffee etc...  There was a small fridge and an apple computer, which also doubled as the TV/Radio, excellent. Our room fronted the main road, so a little noisy with the window open. As it was a warm evening we shut it and put on the air conditioning and slept very well, the blackout curtains assisted perfectly.  Nor were we disturbed by any corridor noise. Highly recommended for the location and facilities generally."

Keep it up 
We will call again soon
Recommended as it's close by all Bristol has to offer
In  from London needed a pit stop and it was worth the money for room meal and breakfast"
1781,Immyl,2014-07-31,4.0,"What you expect Pretty much what you expect at this price.  The best thing for me was that it has an empty mini bar fridge and so you are able to stock up on your own things.  The hotel is a very short walk from Bristol Temple Meads - exit the station from the back exit rather than the front and you are literally across the road.  The hotel is on Temple Way, so it is up and over the bridge to the city centre, quite close to the Cabot (cabbot?) circus shopping centre.  If you exit the hotel at the rear, and walk through the church yard, out the other side is a quaint pub and also a tesco express.  If you fancy a walk, keep walking and you will soon find a bit of Bristol Character.  

It is a great hotel for commuting as the train station is so close, but check where your offices are as there doesnt seem to be much nearby, although close to the city centre

Rooms are all clean and straightforward.  The staff are helpful and friendly as can be, i havent had any problems."
1782,cathyp844,2014-07-31,5.0,"Hilton Garden Inn Bristol UK An excellent weekend and thoroughly recommend the hotel. There is so much to see in Bristol.  Saturday, we attended the St Paul's Carnival followed by a show at Bristol Hippodrome in the evening.  Pre-dinner at hotel and drinks.  Walked back to hotel through the historic streets of old Bristol.  There is an interesting park and ruined Church at back of hotel.  Sunday morning we walked all around Bristol Harbourside, brilliant coffee at Bordeau Quay Restaurant.  Water taxi back to centre of Bristol and then a bus to Museum to view the latest Banksy picture.  Visit it before it is sold!  Walked down Park Street and visited The Severn Shed for a coffee and cake and walked back to the hotel for a siesta followed by dinner.  An excellent weekend.....and we live 13 miles outside of Bristol."
1783,Connolly2013,2014-07-31,3.0,Average for a Hilton We have just returned from a weekend at the Hilton Garden Inn. Our room on the 5th floor was very clean and tidy. It was also very quiet and overlooked the park behind the hotel. The breakfast was good. On the downside we did not receive a very warm welcome. We arrived early and were just told to come back at 3pm. There was then a big queue and check in was slow. The car park is also very expensive (£12 per day) and small.I would recommend looking for somewhere else nearby that is cheaper. It was 15 mins to the centre of town. If you want to be right in the action there are closer hotels. Overall a good base but we thought it was rather expensive for what we got.
1784,viksta90,2014-07-31,4.0,"Convenient location, friendly staff. My partner and I have just returned from a two night stay. We arrived at approx 7pm on Friday night. There were no spaces in the car park, however when I went in to ask where else we could park was advised we could park on the white crisscross lines as others had. This was fine, the only slight irritant was getting a phone call on Saturday, when we were out at an attraction the other side of Bristol, from the hotel asking me very politely if I could move my car as another car could not get out. When I explained our situation and asked which car was blocked as we had checked with the hotel we could park there (and there was ample room) it turned out the muppet in the White Audi who had arrived after us the night before (and parked so close to my car I nearly had kittens) had been blocked in by someone just arriving, when they then moved they could get out. Therefore not our fault and easily rectified, the receptionist was very apologetic. 

The room itself was on the fourth floor park side, was a nice size, clean and well presented, the Apple Mac and complimentary wifi was also a real treat. 

The bed was comfy and pillows snugly, the air con worked gone and was easily adjustable. The first night we did hear some sirens and I did wake up, but we then found out the end window behind the curtain was open, once closed no outside noise. 

We did have a problem with the iron not heating up, but when I rang reception they were more than happy to bring up a replacement. 

We also had breakfast, there was a good selection of hot and cold food, the first morning was quieter and very pleasant. It was a bit different this morning being much busier, it felt more rushed, we also missed the friendly local staff we'd had the morning before. 

The location of the hotel is ideal, a couple of minutes walk to Bristol Temple Meads station, and a 15 minute relaxed stroll into the centre. 

We really enjoyed our break in Bristol and will return."
1785,11JimB,2014-07-31,4.0,"Good, but not great for a Hilton. Overall the hotel is nice and in a good location. Rooms are reasonably sized for European standards.  The breakfast is fine if you are a gold member and they include it, but I would be mad if I paid £10 for it.  My main complaint was housekeeping.  I complained about them leaving only one towel and rather than address the problem the front desk told me there should be another towel in the wardrobe (there wasn't. ) I ended up needing to leave a note each day asking for a second towel.  They also did not change out dirty glasses. I had to go to the bar each day to ask for a clean glass to drink from. Not really the level of service I expect from a hilton."
1786,Hearts5Hibs1,2014-07-31,4.0,"Ok Great location,as I came in by train & was visiting a business nearby.
For the price (over a hundred pounds a night) I felt that I have stayed at, if I'm honest, superior hotels for less.
Rooms aren't big, well the one I was in wasn't. But it was clean.
I didn't have an evening meal there but did have the DIY breakfast which was perfectly acceptable.
So, ok, but def not the best I've been in for the price."

Good room facilities - such as the computer / IMAC with plenty of tv channels. The only bad point about the room is the slightly erratic a/c - making the room a bit too warm for the summer. The breakfast was great - and the bar facilities were also fine."

1791,Stells09,2014-07-31,3.0,"Not what I expected from a Hilton. Me and my husband visited the bristols Hilton for our wedding anniversary, the location of the hotel is fab, your in walking distance to the town and the Harbour, also 5 min walk from train station and there is also a weatherspoons  2 min away. There is a bus stop either side of the road with regular buses. On arrival on the Hilton ( which was our first time stayed in a Hilton ) the inside was very small but clean and tidy, we went to the desk to drop our bags off as our room was no ready yet, I have to admit it wasn't the best welcome seems we had to ask for something to say she had oue bags, but she was trying her best, we also decided to have the breakfast which was 10.99...  The room on first look was very small, but was amazed by the Apple TV, but shocked there was 2 chairs in the room ( specially when there was not much small space) the room wasn't very clean or in great condition but the bed was clean and tidy... The rooms needed a good clean and a freshen up, also the air con didn't work very well.. We was on the 4th floor so we expected from the pictures the room would be bigger and at least clean. After spending all day in the town, we went back to the room for a good night sleep, unfortunately  me and my husband found the bed very un-comftable  , mattress was very hard and springy and the pillows felt old and it was really difficult to get comftable on them, when we went down to the desk to enquire about a bill for the breakfast that had been pushed threw our door we did mention we didn't  have a good night sleep, we was asked what the issue was and I mentioned that pillows and the husband the mattress, we was advised we could of asked for a quilt to go underneath the sheet to make it softer, but it was a bit late seems we was only staying one night, and I wasn't willing to walk down to the desk at 2am for the quilt to go under the sheet, The breakfast was ok, I liked the waffles but the breakfast was loop warm, felt sorry for the staff as they seemed to be running around a lot to serve a lot of people. 
The hotel it self was lovely and clean it was very small, and not what I expected from a Hilton, it reminded me to much of a holiday in ( obviously with out the mac ) 
Personally I'm not sure if I would stay in this hotel again"
1792,W4766HDkevinh,2014-07-31,4.0,"Comfortable hotel close to Temple Meads We needed a hotel for an overnight stay close to Temple Meads. This seemed ideal! I used to work in Bristol back when this was the City Inn. If you are arriving via Temple Meads, then do follow the walking instructions on the hotel web-site. Hotel is modern, light and airy. Receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Our double bedroom overlooked the park and was well equipped with air conditioning, hairdryer, ironing board and iron, tea making facilities and an Apple computer /TV (which took some working out). A comfortable night's sleep!"

1794,LondonSeb,2014-06-30,3.0,"Small rooms, limited paid parking, average location Stayed there in June. Rooms are small, but beds are comfortable. Fairly quiet during the night.

Hotel outdoor car park is quite small, and also costing £10 for an overnight stay. Does not really offer any protections to cars, since wide open to pedestrians. No spaces left after 8pm. 

Hotel location is average, with a 10-15 minute walk to the centre of Bristol and a selection of restaurants.

Conclusion: quite pricey for what it is, considering the size of the rooms, and the additional breakfast and car park cost"

1798,JS2209,2014-06-30,4.0,"Good location, lovely breakfast and nice rooms The hotel is situated just five minutes walk from Temple Meads and ten to fifteen minutes from the City Centre/Cabot Circus. Check in was quick and simple, we arrived at 3pm and there was no queue. We stayed for a stag do and the hotel were very accommodating. There was also a hen party staying so they had no issues with taking group bookings. 

The room was clean and comfortable with plenty of amenities; kettle, tea/coffee, fridge, safe, iMac computer/TV system and hairdryer. There was also a number of electrical sockets within close proximity to mirrors - we often find that the hairdryer never quite reaches! The bathroom was on the small side but had a great power shower!!

Breakfast was definitely worth having, especially when you get the B&B deal. We noticed that you could buy it at check in for around £15. All the usual stuff, plus a waffle maker which we made full use of.

Having booked this in the Hilton sale, the room was £66 including breakfast which was very reasonable given the alternatives for a Saturday night. We would definitely recommend the hotel and would use it again in the future."

We found the reception staff very professional and courteous, Sylvia, in particular was very helpful, as it was our first time in Bristol.

We didn't eat in the restaurant."
1800,Gordonrgs37,2014-06-30,2.0,"Expensive. Sterile. Annoying Stayed here for two nights and there are a lot of positives, the hotel is nicely located, close to Temple Meads railway station and about a 20 minutes walk from then quayside attractions. It's a modern, clean hotel, rooms are small but well equipped and it generally has a quality feel.

However, for what you get it's expensive, the first night was paid for my company, and then my wife joined me for the second night,  we paid £120 for the room, with a tiny bathroom, you pay extra for breakfast and parking, so our total bill was £154, for this you don't get a pool, or gym and the bar area is small.

Only used the restaurant for breakfast, which was typical buffet style and left a lot to be desired, cold and not fresh at all. The staff had all been on the Hilton 'Have a Nice Day' customer service school, and said/ did all the right things but not a glimmer of interest in their customers.

Overall a very disappointing stay, actually quite annoying, but if you want a sterile, no fuss hotel, you'll enjoy it."
1801,rene18,2014-06-30,4.0,"Great Location When leaving Temple Meads station take the side door and walk past Wetherspoons. The hotel is under five minutes walk. Check in was quick but when we got to our room it was like walking into a sauna despite the air conditioning unit being set at zero and fan off.  Tried turning it down to -3 and adjusting fan speed but it still threw out hot air. After eating out and coming back to the room, breaking out in a sweat as soon as we entered, I contacted reception. The receptionist came up, tried to adjust it and told us she would reset it back at the front desk and it would take a few minutes to settle.  No it didn't.  Phoned reception and was offered another room. I was told the unit had been switched off but it was still belching out hot air so obviously a fault somewhere. I couldn't have slept there so thank goodness there was another room available.  It was absolute bliss walking into it. Would like to say the staff dealing with this were very helpful and polite throughout.  The hotel itself is very clean with great facilities and a fabulous breakfast and I would definately stay here again if I was in the area. I took a star off as, when we went to dinner (unbooked) I was told there would be a 25 minute wait. That's nothing I thought. After waiting 30mins we were given a table and a menu and then ignored. No-one asked if we wanted drinks. After another 30 mins I had to go and ask someone if we could order. We eventually started eating an hour and a half after we came down.  The restaurant was busy but if we were told at the start it would take that long we would have walked to the harbourside to one of the many restaurants making better use of our time instead of sitting bored. The food was delicious though!!"
1802,TravelKaizen,2014-06-30,3.0,"Good hotel but very small bath rooms Hotel located in 10 min walking distance from the train station. Nice front desk staff. Rooms small but well furnished in contemporary style. The Mac computer screen is also the TV. Smallest bath room I ever had in a hotel. Got annoying on the second day. Clean and ok maintained. Room ok for the 99,-. pounds, without breakfast. Approx 20 min walk to the real centre where the action takes place. If one prefers very centrally, then the RadissonBlue or Mercure would be a good choice. Marriott Royal also, but higher end than all other hotels in Bristol. Still an enjoyable stay at the Hilton Garden Inn."
1803,895MicheleC,2014-06-30,4.0,"Great Overnight stay My son and I shared a twin room here last weekend as we were attending the Uni open day.
We arrived fairly late (around 9pm) and the hotel car park was full so we parked in the overflow which charges hourly from 8.00am (although free overnight).
The reception staff were great, making check in very quick and explaining our various options (with map) as to how to get to the Uni.
The room was very clean.  The applemac was a nice touch although does not have the best picture quality.  The beds were extremely comfortable and all the linen clean.  The mini bar is not stocked and you can go down to the foyer to buy what you need for a relatively reasonable price.  The hotel has Neutrogena products in the bathroom.
The breakfast was served from 6am and was the usual buffet arrangement which was good.
I was able to move the car to the hotel car park in the morning and the reception staff adjusted my  parking fee (normally £10) accordingly which I thought was a nice touch.
The hotel appeared to be accommodating mainly parents with potential students for the Uni or business people and is ideal for both. 
This hotel is not one to book for a holiday but for an overnight or short stay in a convenient location in Bristol (just off the motorway but in the city) it is ideal."

1805,Ejtraveller,2014-06-30,3.0,"Fix The Air Conditioning We stayed in this Hoyle for one night for a Hen Party. There were 17 of us altogether. 

The hotel is lovely, in a great location- close to the train station and town centre.

The rooms were very plush and came well-equipped with hair dryers, irons toiletries, shower caps etc, although a little on the small side. We only needed the rooms for a bed and a shower though so the size of the rooms  didn't concern us.

We checked in Saturday the 21st June and checked out on the 22nd. Check in was smooth. And easy. 

All staff were attentive and friendly a willing to help when necessary. 

I can't comment on evening food or lunch as we ate out.
Breakfast was delicious with a huge selection of food, waffles and branded cereals. 

The only issues we encountered with our stay were:

1: The cost of parking (which we were not informed about upon booking) £10 a day!!! Glad we were only there for one night. I believe parking should be inclusive of the price of the hotel. 

2. Myself and my friend who shared a room had issues getting into our room after out night out. Both of the keys didn't work. We could understand if one key didn't work, but both? Unacceptable. Especially as my friend returned back to the hotel  before me and had the issue first (resolved by going to reception at 2am) then I came home later at 3.30am and had the same issue- I didn't think to go to reception, so knocked to wake my friend up to let me in. Really not on. I know I probably could have gone to reception but I shouldn't have been in that situation in the first place... The keys, or at least one of them, should have been working anyway. 

3. My biggest gripe- the air conditioning!!!! It was horrendous!!! I would like to say that it was just the room that I stayed in but as we were part of a hen party we paid for quite a few rooms and everybody had the same issue, the air conditioning did not work in any of the rooms. I can understand that England isn't known for hot temperatures but the weekend we stayed at this hotel is was two very hot summer days on the Saturday and the Sunday. It made sleeping very uncomfortable. I would not return to this hotel unless I knew for definite that the air conditioning was fixed. 

We were charged £25 deposit per room in case of any damages. I don't know if that was just because we were a hen party or if that's a general rule. 

I can't comment on 'value for money' as I didn't book the hotel for the group. I would imagine that for 17 of us, a lot of money was exchanged. 

Overall it was a pleasant stay but especially as we're coming into summer now, the air conditioning really does need addressing."

Rooms are bright and modern looking with plenty of drawer and cupboard space if you like to completely unpack and not live out of a suitcase. Bathroom was compact but functional. The addition of an iMac inplace of a TV is a unique touch but doubt many would use it as a PC (preferring to use their own) and like earlier mentioned not really suitable for a TV - with its restricted menu, however there is a good selection of channels including Sky Sports.
Breakfast was good but staff were a bit over keen to remove plates. The restaurant has a good varied menu but is ridiculously expensive - £10 for a fish finger sandwich!!!!

1809,KMRS88,2014-06-30,4.0,"Lovely central hotel for short break We stayed for 3 nights at the start of June and could not really find any faults. We had no issue with the parking as we arrived fairly early and didn't really take the car out once we were in Bristol. 
I did originally find the £10 per day parking charge a little high but as we were able to park there all day and all night, I suppose it's not bad for a city centre. 
We were greeted by friendly staff upon our arrival who gave us advise on the best routes to take based on where we had told them we were planning to go. We were also provided with maps which was handy. 
We were staying on the 4th floor which an elevator takes you to. The room is fairly small but it was plenty big enough for myself and my partner as we only really slept and got ready there, the rest of the time we were bury exploring the wonderful Bristol! The room has everything you could need and the toiletries were plentiful and to a high quality. The shower was amazing once you get the temperature setting right! The iMac was handy however my partner did watch the football on night and didn't think much of the picture quality. The WIFI was easy to connect to and we didn't have any problems with internet connection the whole weekend. There was a small fridge in the room which was great as we had brought food and drink with us for the room. 
The bed was SO COMFY I didn't want to leave it. Soft, squishy pillows and a lovely firm mattress! It took us a day to figure out the air-con but once we did, it worked perfectly and really cooled the room down which was lovely when the window only opened a little as standard in hotel rooms! We didn't have any issues with noise from the traffic but we were at the back of the hotel overlooking the park and not right next to a main road as it is at the front. Room service was great the one day we did have it but I personally find it a little unnecessary to have it every day so we left our Do Not Disturb sign most of the time. 
The hotel is in a great location, about a 10min walk to the city centre which was nice as it meant we weren't right at the heart of all the hustle and bustle! There is a lovely park right opposite the hotel which is next to some very beautiful church ruins. Once you get your bearings in Bristol, it is very easy to get to the city centre, train station and many other local attractions. 
I would stay at this hotel again if i was visiting Bristol and would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to visit for a short break."

1811,Jigroll,2014-06-30,5.0,Pleasant stay in Bristol This hotel as a modest car park which was full on arrival. Luckily a space became available as I checked in. Checking was swift and pleasant.

Great location and reasonably quite especially for a busy city centre. Would recommend for business or pleasure.
1812,wagmanWorcestershire,2014-06-30,4.0,"Very attentive staff We were with a coach party staying for one night on the 8th of June.The Hotel is very centrally placed for many of Bristol's activities. Within minutes of arriving we had our room key from a very helpful lady and accessed our room. 
The room was very clean with a large bed and had everything we needed for an overnight stay. The tv was an Apple computer which also provided a high quality tv picture. All the major channels were available. The bathroom, although small, has everything you could need including complimentary toiletries.
We had an evening meal and a breakfast included and the food was excellent. Although they were Buffet style meals served by the chef, any staff available wanted to help serve less mobile customers and did it with a smile on their faces. I was particularly impressed with the staff's attitude."
1813,Andiamagnet,2014-06-30,3.0,"Mixed feelings Me and my friend decided to take a break a visit Bristol for a weekend.As we stayed at Hilton hotels many times we had no hesitation where to stay.

Good things first:
- excellent location
- reasonable price
- great breakfast
- room service quick with very tasty food.

Not that good:
As the staff are particulary friendly and helpful we found the lady on the check in quite rude (I think she was polish).After breakfast we went to ask if late check out is possible, she answer us "" yeah I need you to charge for that tho"" and didn't even ask for how long we needed to stay.

Apple Mac's are nice perk once is worked, what is not quite case. Mouse and keyboard wasn't working correctly so we used our own. 

As someone previously mentioned the beds are quite hard.For a first time I had really bad sleep at Hilton due to very hard mattress.we woke up more tired as we went to bed.

Air-con  not functioning properly.

Bathroom not very clean"
1814,Pepsi-Josh,2014-04-30,4.0,"Excellent Apple Mac's in the room, a small gym room and the hotel is situated in a central location The hotel is situated within walking distance from the main shopping area & clubs...what more could you possibly want?
The is no swimming pool which is probably the only negative thing I can say about the hotel."

1816,Krb88,2014-05-31,3.0,"Nearly but not quite I've stayed at the hilton twice this month on business and whilst the first visit was quite in eventful they did charge me for a large glass of wine (£6.50ish) when I only had a small (£3.75) although it's not a lot of money it's the principle and I wonder if they try it on with everyone. The second time was not so good. The wifi didn't work, and I needed it to work in the evening so I was offered to move rooms, I did explain to the receptionist that I had room service coming so id like to eat and then move. She still insisted on coming up and moving me, and at the Same time the food arrived mid move. This meant it was cold by the time I came to eat it. The chicken burger was very chargrilled and didn't taste of anything but charcoal. They did refund my dinner in the morning which was a good gesture. It's a lovely looking and clean hotel (although very small rooms and bathrooms) and it could be lovely but they just seem to be missing something."
1817,Lwsy1920,2014-04-30,4.0,"modern hotel We enjoyed our very last minute stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. Really close to the city centre. The hotel car park was full though and we had to park elsewhere which was annoying! But overall we enjoyed our stay here, the room was perfect, great modern facilities and all for a reasonable price with no complaints!"
1818,chorleyboy,2014-05-31,4.0,"Perfectly adequate hotel. Stayed 3 nights Friday to Monday. One or two problems, wake up calls at 6am Saturday  though I hadnt requested them, and the banging of the doors countless times by the hen party on the same floor but after calming down especially about the early calls and reception initially telling me it would be another guest trying to contact me, until I got the automated voice informing me I had ordered it, but obviously had not, I thought it was a nice hotel, great shower, room a little small if there was 2 sharing for 3 nights but very clean.
Handy little fridge too, and safe, along with the usual Hilton extras.
I had a park view, if you can call it that, but at least you are around the back and not facing the major road at the front.
Restaurant seems popular, 2 AA rosette, didnt try it, breakfast same, but I preferred to walk through that small park to a Subway where breakfast is only £2-£2.30 with a cappucino included.
From the train station it is only a few minutes away if you take the right route, ask where the Wetherspoons is, from there just stay left from the outside area, you will see the hotel as you walk around the corner.
Bristol itself is a great place to visit, lots of great real ale pubs which suits me.
I would stay again here, if I got roughly the same deal of £50 a night (originally booked for 2 but wife couldnt make it) over the weekend.
One final mention, the staff are very pleasant and overall very helpful."

Light airy reception and the welcome was polite and efficient. The room was clean, well appointed and comfortable.

1824,spaddockuk,2014-05-31,3.0,"GLAD I WASN'T PAYING Definitely a Hilton Lite hotel. Rooms small; no bath – but excellent shower. Very comfortable bed. The Hilton Honors features you get in other Hiltons are not evident here: free bottled water first night only, daily newspaper either the FT or the iPaper, no real choice.

Very handy for the station and the airport bus stops right outside on the inward route. Not cheap – for a much lower class Hilton - but as I was on Hilton Points it was not a big deal. I was glad not to be paying, though.

Reception was efficient and reception staff all very pleasant. But are these people only to be sourced in eastern Europe these days?

Downside – the breakfast was dire. Dreadful service from quite pleasant and charming young staff – though the room was not even half full. It took ten minutes for the worst cup of coffee in the world to materialise. It was supposed to be a cappuccino but was indescribable; it tasted of diesel… Two poached eggs requested arrived hard and without toast. 

Ghastly piped muzak, of which only the thumping base was audible. Suggestion: if you are staying and need breakfast – go to the Yurt across the road by the station. Half the price and ten times the quality. And the music there is truly cool."
1825,SomersetSpud,2014-05-31,4.0,"Modern, clean and comfortable Visited on a sunny Saturday in May and thoroughly liked the place.  Staff all very pleasant and efficient and spoke good English.  Didn't try the breakfast, so the Hotwire rate was excellent value at £82 for the night.

Modern and well-equipped rooms with most everything you could want.  Nice range of toiletries and the bathroom was clean, stylish and effective.

Slept well in a room overlooking the park, no issues with aircon and a nice touch if you were staying longer is the fridge is empty if you want to bring your own drink/snacks etc; good idea.  Only used the Apple Mac for television and worked OK - terrified I'd lose the tiny little remote control though!

Only knocked a point off for the car park which is very small, expensive (£10 a day) and a nightmare to get in and out from; I had to reverse the whole length of the car park before attempting to turn around.

Location isn't bad, a little too far out for me but we saw areas of Bristol we'd never seen before, and it really isn't too far to walk into town (10  mins max).  Bottom line is I'd stay again at the same rate."
1826,609ruthb,2014-05-31,5.0,"Great Stay at Hilton Garden Inn at Bristol We had only ever visited Bristol once before and found the roads very busy - traffic wise.  We had tickets for a concert at Colston Hall and decided to stay overnight to avoid parking and trying to find hall etc.  It was a great stay - the hotel is really splendid - the room very clean, comfortable bed and pillows and bathroom whilst not spacious was very clean and adequate.  We had just a regular room but we were emailed a week prior to our stay to say we could have upgraded the room for only £10 for the night.  Had we been staying for a couple of days we might have done this. We had breakfast in the morning at the café and the quality of food and service was excellent. We would definitely return to this hotel if we want to  stay in the Bristol area again."
1827,Rooby25,2014-05-31,3.0,"Pleasant stay, Good location! Stayed here at the weekend for one night with some girly friends. 

Really enjoyed the stay overall, the hotel had a newly refurbished feel and was clean and modern. 

Car parking wasn't an issue as we got the last 2 spaces, although I had to park on some chevron'y type area which I doubt should be used in ideal circumstances! I'm not sure where we would have parked if the chef hadn't come out to give up his space! 

Staff were friendly and polite, especially the chap who worked in the coffee bar! We had a relaxing few hours sitting in the bar / lounge catching up over drinks which was really enjoyable. 

We caught a cab to harbourside which was only £6-7 although we'll know for next time that the hotel is very well situated to the city centre and I think a 20-30 minute walk would take you pretty much anywhere you needed to go. 

Although my room was 'compact' it had some super features, an iMac with free WiFi, fridge, safe and decent shower. Personally the bed was a little hard for my liking so I didn't have the best night sleep but something like that is very subjective, so shouldn't affect a choice in staying there. 

I also found my room too hot and despite figuring out the air-con and popping it on full, it didn't seem to make a difference. I tried the window but that wouldn't open far enough to create a breeze. 

Breakfast was good. I asked for poached eggs which were cooked to order and were lovely. Speciality coffees could also be requested, and although I didn't have one, the waffles looked and smelt amazing! 

Would definitely return."

The room service was delivered in time, however, the twin room we had was quite small, a little too small. Very disappointed with the stay, for this money I expect more comfort!  There are quite a few hotels closer to the city centre, but is fine if you have a car and are willing to pay £10 parking costs for parking at the hotel car park."
1830,boxyuk,2014-05-31,4.0,"Surprisingly lovely little hotel from a big chain Stayed just one Saturday night and I was pleasantly surprised by this place .

I always expect a business type room with standard amenities but the Apple Mac , safe and fridge were a bit of a bonus. The room was very clean  with  fresh white crisp linen  . The bathroom clean and stocked with nice shampoos shower gels and fluffy white towels . Plenty of seating in the room and storage . The welcome at reception was lovely and the the hotel was full but the staff still had time for us . Plenty of hen parties there and the receptionist was at pains to point out if we experienced any problems to call reception immediately as there were staff on all night and would deal with any issues immediately . Which as a woman on my own was very comforting . 
The staff were smiling and seemed happy in there work .
Breakfast was ok for £10.95 tinned fruit was a little disappointing but a small gripe really . Staff again always I hand to fill up coffee or tea .. 
Would stay here again as it's in a great location for shops and main harbour side .. And seems to have a happy crew of staff :-)"

 I dont mind a buffet breakfast but ordered two poached eggs on toast, the very pleasant waitress bought me two poached eggs on a plate and I was told to do my own toast, good job there was no queue for the toaster or my eggs would have been cold....as it happened they were lovely. 
 Check you quick check out bill, mine had two car parking charges for one night, neither matched my car.....quickly solved by efficient reception staff. 
 Thank you Hilton on the whole very pleasant."
1835,Q8228EQjamese,2014-05-31,3.0,Hilton Garden Inn Room very small. Bed not comfortable. Paying for parking. Residents parking should be free. Bar small and noisy when busy.

1836,600shirleyn,2014-05-31,5.0,"Great food, great stay Always has looked a bit basic in the foyer/bar, but nice room (bed a little hard), very clean, tidy, right temperature and the food was excellent. We last ate in the restaurant a couple of years ago (several times) and were concerned the quality will have deteriorated, but not so! Great food (husband said he just wishes there was a little more of it).  Excellent location on the edge of the town centre."

From our first contact with the staff at the Reception desk to a hug on leaving from the Dining room Manager we could not have been happier. My wife was impressed with the standard of cleanliness. The breakfast were good but the outstanding feature was the staff. In all departments House keeping, Reception, Dining room and Bar all the staff we came into contact with were friendly and helpful. The location is great, close to the centre but far enough away from the noise. We would stay here again."

Fridge in room did not work first person who came to look at fridge informed me that it was only for storing food was not meant to keep it cold.  It was only when I insisted that the purpose of a fridge was to keep food and drink cold did she agree to get somebody else to look at fridge. Man came tested fridge and then brought a replacement. Man did not say one word to us. Think he may not have spoken English. Parking at hotel was £10 a night. There were not enough spaces for guests to park.  On second night someone had driven through the barrier into the car park. Barrier was not replaced during our stay.  Breakfast was ok. Was within easy walking distance of Bristol city centre. There was a German Christmas market in town which was very festive. Would stay here again due to good location."

1840,816staceyf,2014-05-31,2.0,"Would not stay hear again. Arrived at the hotel to find no parking spaces so parked on the white lines outside, so went to check in and ask where to park, was told parking on the white lines was fine if we wasn't blocking anybody in. While checking in we paid car park £10 and booked breakfast £10.95 each and then was told the price for that would be £35.90, when my husband questioned the price saying it shouldn't be that much the receptionist became sarcastic and started counting out the price to him only to be embarrassed that my husband was right and we was over charged as it should of only £31.90. We had booked a meal deal with the hotel and was told that the restaurant was fully booked so we would have to eat in the bar absolutely fine don't mind doing that. Got to our room which was clean and tidy few stains on the carpet and room is quite small but in all fine. Got ready then went down to dinner only to be told when we got there that restaurant was full and all tables in the bar were booked so we couldn't have dinner there that night so went to reception to speak to them and was told I will find out if you can have dinner in your room with out the service charge, but if we wanted to eat in our room we would of stayed at home so if we couldn't eat there can we have the money back and were go eat else where, then the woman came out of the bar saying she didn't realise that we were residents and thought that we had just turned up there with a voucher for dinner. Dinner it self was nice but small. Next morning went down to breakfast which was very nice after breakfast we went to check out walked up to reception asked to check out and gave the woman our key card then she just stood there staring at me but not talking I asked if every thing was ok and was told yes you can go now asked how we get out of the car park she said oh year your need this then threw a piece of paper on the desk and turned around. 

IN all hotel its self is very nice and food is good but the staff are very stuck up and rude will not be returning to a Hilton hotel again would much rather go to a premier inn or jury inn where the staff are much more helpful and friendly."
1841,738JamesC738,2014-04-30,5.0,"Fantastic Service We stayed at the hotel recently to attend the Bristol Folk Festival and checked in at about 11pm. The room we were directed to looked great, classic modern, clean and well equipped. On closer inspection we found one of the lights wasn't working. The response by staff was immediate and very apologetic.  Even though it was quite late, we were moved to another room. Once there, we had to contact management again because the computer was having problems.  This was quickly resolved and we were given complementary drinks. Again, the staff were very polite and helpful.   In the morning the handle on the bathroom door became detached from the door when my husband went to open it.

By now we were wondering whether we would be labelled ""awkward Guests"", but no.  The staff were brilliant.  We were allocated another room for our second night, where we enjoyed a very peaceful, uneventful stay.  

So, many thanks to all involved for your care and consideration during our visit. Thanks too, to the restaurant staff for the delicious breakfast."

1845,Soo2402,2014-05-31,4.0,"Very compact rooms indeed but adequate. This hotel was perfect for us to visit the  Harbourside area.

The rooms are very small yet modern and clean. All have an IMac yet ours wasn't working in the first room do we were moved to another.... The IMac in that room had an issue of a noise interference which the hotel staff tried to repair whilst we visited the local bars. The issue wasn't repaired so we were therefore given a complimentary breakfast which was well received. 

A negative noticed with this hotel was the small selection of goods sold in the foyer.... A Youngs frozen fish pie £8 as well as £5 Tampax in stock seemed a little extortionate in my opinion. Particularly to charge such high prices for ladies essentials is outrageous- visitors don't forget to take your own necessaries and any microwave meal you may wish for."

1853,Be_Steve09,2014-04-30,2.0,"OK, if you can sleep on a concrete bed! Probably one of the most uncomfortable beds that we have ever slept on - the Head Office buyer of these beds needs to sample the goods before he / she buys, before subjecting unsuspecting guests to a very unpleasant night, we'd have probably slept better lying on the floor!

We arrived at around 14:15 hrs on a Saturday 26th April, (we knew that check-in was from 15:00 hrs,) mind you it's a good job we did arrive early, since there were just two parking spaces remaining in the car park! We queued at reception for 10 minutes whilst others checked in, to be told, when we arrived at the head of the queue that 'our' room was not yet ready, we were told to go away & come back at 15:00 hrs. Funnily enough the 15 or so people behind us in the queue were subsequently checked in to their rooms without a hitch, why we couldn't have been allocated another room I just don't know? 

At 15:00 hrs we subsequently rejoined a queue, to be told again that our room was still not ready? You can imagine our reaction, apparently the room we'd been allocated had the two singles pushed together & a member of housekeeping staff had yet to get around to separate them! We advised the receptionist that this was exactly what we wanted (we'd requested a twin so that we could indeed push the beds together,) what we didn't want was a 4' 6"" small double bed, which is exactly what you get with a 'double room' apparently.

The room allocated to us, No. 221 front road facing room, had triple glazing, so zero road noise, however the issue we had was a lack of fresh air, whilst there was a small window that opened by few inches the resultant road noise created another problem. The room had an air conditioning unit, which regulated the temperature quite well but using it (as with any air-con unit) while trying to sleep gives you quite a dry throat so this had to be turned off.

In terms of room size it was no larger than a standard 'Premier Inn' hotel room & certainly not much better although around twice the price of a standard 'Premier Inn' at £89.00 / night, the only 'extra you get as part of the deal is an 'Apple imac TV/PC, so all in all not a great stay I'm afraid & especially for the price paid, suggest you go to 'Premier Inn' & 'a guaranteed good nights sleep or your money back' - appears this is not offered by Hilton Garden Inns in the UK, only in their sister hotels in the USA!"

1856,858KeithD,2014-04-30,2.0,"Not a room to ""upgrade"" to It wasn't until we were leaving that we discovered we had been charged for an ""upgraded"" room. This meant it was at the back of the hotel away from the trafic at the front and was supposed to have views over the garden. Turns out that we were charged for a room that had a view of a car-park and the noise of the hotel's own music being played to anybody who happened to be passing out on the street complete with the smell of smokers gathering just below our window in the evening. In the morning you have the noise of delivery vans and refuse lorries. I didn't know I had being charged for an upgrade so just put up with the room as with a city centre location you can't expect the peace and quiet of the coutryside but to only find out at checkout that you had been charged for a ""better"" and ""quieter"" room with a ""view"" came as a bit of a surprise."

Used the dinning room this time and found the meals to be of an excellent quality. There is a public pay and display just outside the hotel if you want to avoid the hotel car park, but this is limited to 4 hours during daytime, good if you have an early start. Top marks to the cleaners has the room is spotlessly clean."
1858,PurbeckPrincess,2014-03-31,4.0,"Very convenient! The Hilton was very clean and comfortable, although the room size was smaller than expected, given that it was a Hilton hotel.  The food was very good and the staff were very helpful and attentive.  The water taxis stop a few yards away too which was lovely!"
1859,Smiley-Caz,2014-04-30,3.0,"Some good points and some not so good points Although now part of the Hilton chain you can tell this hotel was formerly a Mint hotel due to things like the Apple Macs in the room. 

Good points

Good sound proofing - we weren't disturbed by noise from the corridor or neighbouring rooms
Good air conditioning - was easy to keep the room at a comfortable temperature
Fridge in room - handy for keeping a few drinks chilled
Room cleanliness was good

Not so good -

Small and hard bed - why oh why do hotels scrimp on bed size? The bed was double which I find too small for me and my partner to sleep comfortable together.  We also found the bed hard
Parking charge - at £10 a day parking was a bit pricey

Location wise it is about a 10 minute walk to the main shopping areas and bars."
1860,carnieboy,2014-04-30,5.0,"Birthday Treat We stayed at Hilton Gardens on the bank holiday weekend and I was very happy with the stay. We managed to get a good weekend deal with evening meals and breakfasts for both days. We had to pay £10 per night parking but we were made aware of this beforehand so it was not a surprise. The hotel is fairly modern and is in a good location to be. 5-8 mins walk into town through a nice park then over the river and 5 mins walk to train station . The room we had was on the 5th floor, nice room and very clean, no probs with room at all . The evening meal was from a set menu with starter, main and a desert . Very limited choice to be honest but again, this was expected as it is part of the ""package"" we paid for. Very tiny portion of chicken with 4 tiny half potatoes. Not enough to make u feel full up. We did not have the meal the next night as we decided to eat out, lovely Italian just through the park . Breakfast was very nice, buffet style and this was very good. Sausages need cooking more however, I saw 3-4 other people had not are there's either. Very pink in middle. Other than this I can honestly recommend this hotel. Will defo go back to Bristol and when we do, will stay at the Hilton Gardens for sure ."
1861,Tess14344,2014-04-30,4.0,"Base for Bath trip Stayed here for 3 nights, using Bristol and the hotel as my base for a 2-day leisure trip to Bath.  The hotel is conveniently located for Temple Meads Station, which is only about a 5-min walk.  There are frequent trains between Bristol Temple Meads and Bath Spa. My room was modern, clean, and had all the conveniences (coffee, tea making facilities, safe, fridge and love the Neutrogena toiletries). Lucia at reception was always smiley and helpful.  As people have commented, the rooms are indeed on the small side but that didn't really matter to me, as I traveled on my own. They have a small gym which I used a few times during my stay.  I would have preferred a normal tv versus an iMac as it's not really suited for watching tv shows and I never used it as a computer - but this is a minor comment.  I would stay here again."
1862,Katie76,2014-04-30,4.0,"Lovely hotel, just turn the heat down please! We had a lovely room on the 4th floor - it felt brand new and was very clean.
Fab Apple TV and comfy desk chair, I would have been very pleased with this if travelling on business.
The room was boiling though, and the air con just created a dry mouth situation which was worse than the heat. I struggled to sleep on the first night because of this.
I used the hotel gym which was deserted and well equipped, but on day two went running outside rather than the treadmill and found a brilliant route down along the harbour side to the ss Great Britain. Far more scenic than the gym wall :0) 
We ate at Marcos olive branch which was just through the park. One of the best Italian (technically Sardinian!) meals I've ever eaten, with great value and service.
We booked through Hotwire and got our parking free. We arrived early and spaces weren't an issue. Later that evening the car park was rammed.
 I would happily stay here again."
1863,daisie67,2014-04-30,2.0,"Not highly recommended I travelled with my daughter on an overnight coach trip.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel for coach parties.  Even our driver had to argue with the staff.  They were expecting us eat our evening meal at 8pm including the under 10s that were on board, but after some persuading they changed their minds.  We had no menus, they gave us a set meal but the chef spat his dummy out because he had to cook different meals for the 2 children.  We asked what was to eat but we could barely understand them as they weren't English (I have no problem with that) but they spoke quietly and fast.

As this hotel is very near the city centre it is more suited for business trips rather than holidays.

The rooms are on the small side and there isn't a TV in the room, but on the plus side there is a imac (computer) with FREE internet, you can watch TV on the imac but there is only a limited amount of channels.

We found the hotel to be clean and tidy as was our room, except for the curtains, they looked like they had been sprayed with grease or something, they were completely stained.

The beds were clean and comfortable, but not suitable for elderly fragile people, the beds were quite high off the ground I could barely get on it.  If an elderly person fell out of these beds they could possibly break something (I mean bones not furniture).

It is quiet with some parking (fee paying) which should be free for the price you pay to stay.

If it's a Hilton hotel you want to stay in try Hilton Bristol near the M4 and M5.

We had no choice but to stay here as it was part of the package but given the choice I wouldn't stay here again."
1864,MDHmaid,2014-04-30,5.0,"Never Been more pleased with a Hotel We went to celebrate my uncles 70th birthday and were looked after royally. The rooms were well presented, comfortable and tidy - my teenage children loved the imac.  Reception staff were always welcoming and helpful.  Breakfast was good and the staff keen to help.  The real stars for us were the evening staff that made sure that my uncles meal went brilliantly and catered for all of our needs - the food was good quality.  The Head waitress organised the room, put up a few decorations, looked after our cake well and made my uncle feel really positive.  The hotel and its staff just made everything easy - the parking and the location were also great."
1865,683ewanj,2014-04-30,4.0,"Hilton Garden Bristol Comfortable and reasonably convenient for city centre, good value with free internet access and a good breakfast. Evening bar food was also very tasty. It is next to a dual carriageway so you want a room on the opposite side of possible (overlooking a quiet side street)."
1866,oliviajenkins13,2014-04-30,4.0,"Wonderful hotel and extremely good value for money The lady at check in was very friendly and I was even offered a double chocolate baked cookie on check in, which I devoured with a cup of tea in the room. 
The room was at the end of the corridor, so I feel my room my have been bigger than others. It was very spacious and the bathroom has all the facilities. I was delighted to see that there was not a TV, but an iMac in the room, meaning it doubles up as a computer and TV.Took a while to understand how to turn on, and everytime I moved the screen it would turn off which was a bit annoying. But had to hold the button down for a few seconds to turn it on. My toilet took a few attempts to flush, but have to hold it down for a long time. Iron and ironing board is provided in the room which was handy for my business meeting tomorrow. Tea and coffee facilities are handy for the morning. 
Location wise, it is only a few minutes walk from temple meads station, and also a few minutes to my meeting the next morning. It has a perfect location and very easy to find, not complicated at all. Beware it is on the main road though, my room faced onto the dual carriageway, although I was not affected by the noise at all. 
Included in my package was a 3 course dinner and bottle of sparkling wine. The restaurant is quite small, and filled mostly with families on a lazy sunday evening. I had the fishcakes, sea bream and treacle tart. All were very tasty and well presented. I did feel quite rushed as the food came extremely fast, however this would be good if you were feeling very hungry or was in a hurry. but i had my meal in 40 minutes, as the dishes were ready as soon as you finished, I don't know whether this was because the waitresses were in a rush though. 
The bed is extremely conmfortable and I slept well, no noise at all until about 9am, which is great.
Breakfast was varied with both cooked breakfast and continental, as well as this, you could make your own waffles with batter and machine provided, and you could order extras like omlettes, eggs how you like them etc. The sausages were proper sausages and tasted great, the bacon a bit greasy for me but I've had worse. Everything to a high standard.
All in all, I am very impressed with this hotel, considering the price I paid £79 with dinner included for one night, it is very good value for money."
1867,elainel330,2014-04-30,4.0,"Looking for Stag/Hen venue - this is probably it Busy hotel within distance of just about everything. Breakfast till 12:00 is great, staff are very friendly and rooms are clean. One watch word though, in this particular hotel the bar is not part of the chain but Franchised out and will close whenever they think - even if customers are there still looking for that cheeky last drink."
1868,ClaireT513,2014-04-30,4.0,"Best Breakfast ever Great location, 5 mins walk from Temple Meads station. Best breakfast ever had in a hotel. Room far too hot and air conditioning was noisy and ineffective. One of the lifts did not work. Very helpful reception staff but all heavily accented so sometimes difficult to understand. £2.50 for tiny bowl of peanuts in bar. Overall though, very good."
1869,Indivisor,2014-04-30,3.0,"Things have gone downhill Since my last stay things have gone downhill and that personal touch seems to have been lost as a result of too much of a business focus rather than a customer focus.  As with most things, its the little things that make a big difference and these seem to have been lost.

Part of this is probably due to a significant change of staff at all levels within the hotel. In addition prices have gone up which now means that it is no longer the value for money offering that it was before"

1873,JulieL687,2014-04-30,3.0,"disappointed Stayed overnight , welcome good but hard to understand the guy on reception.Room clean and tidy though could have been bigger,
Breakfast in morning was the disappointment we wereshown to a table that already been allocated to a group of 4 guys , so they ended up squashed on a table for 2.we were told that someone would be around with teas and coffee in end we got ourselves, plus toast was to be done your self after saying that would be brought to table Good selection of hot breakfast food but ran out fast and not quick to replace, the scrambled eggs were powder ones that tasted awfull.so a big inprovement needed here.
Finally carpark, getting out proved difficult as given a piece of paper which in end hubby had to go back inside and a receptionist came to let us out.please review this as very frustrating.
Overall would we stay at this hotel again, No dont think so, we been to the Hilton Gatwick and could not fault them there.so Bristol Gardens up your game???"
1874,LJS_1985,2014-04-30,1.0,DO NOT STAY HERE! We booked here as a group booking for a hen do. The bride to be was promised a suite however when we got there her room was the same as everyone elses and when we complained to reception we were told that they don't have suites. One of our rooms was also not ready at Check in time which was annoying. The rooms were a good size and had everything you need but it was SO hot and the air con actually just circulated the warm air. All of the other rooms were exactly the same and this actually meant that I had a terrible nights sleep due to the heat. The carpet was also dirty and had hair all over it which was unpleasant. Definitely wouldn't stay here again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1875,116jacjac3,2014-04-30,4.0,"Good but not worth the money Very modern, clean hotel in a good location but not worth £90 a night, as we booked 3 twins and I'm pretty sure they were doubles with the beds split, no room one side or in the middle of them and we had bedside lamps right over the edges of the beds each side which you banged your head on in the night, if you look at their pictures the bedside tables are between the beds in the twin rooms and at the sides in the doubles. Hotel was also far to hot throughout, even though each room has it's own thermostatic controls they don't seem to work and we found out in the morning, along with other guests with the same problem, that we should have asked for them to be reset on the main control panel in reception."

Would definitely recommend."
1880,JulieDavies,2014-03-31,4.0,"Nice hotel We booked in advance, for six of us friends to stay here to help celebrate Hubby's 50th birthday for the weekend.  The hotel was nice enough, we did manage to find a parking space outside, and there was a pleasant welcome from the staff.  

Our room was pleasant enough, the bed was comfy, and it was certainly clean.  We did have the usual problem of hubby and I both drink tea and not coffee ,and so the tea bags and milk soon vanished after the first cup - and when hubby went down to reception to request more they said they had no milk and sent him back up with some milk in a cup - which was better than nothing but not ideal!

We ate our meal in the hotel restaurant on the first evening we stayed, the service was good, the meal was good, but I thought it was on the pricey side for what it was.  A quick round of drinks at the bar, three pints, a vodka, a glass of wine and a lemonade cost £30 which was an ouch!

Breakfast was nice, I think it was my bad luck that as I went to get food from the buffet it was running out and about to be replaced, and that happened both mornings we were there.  It would be nice if it could be replaced just before it actually ran out . . .

Just across the park behind the hotel was a lovely little old pub that is well worth the stroll across the park.

The hotel is not too far a walk from town and the Harbourside.

The six of us enjoyed it, and would stay there again if we go back to Bristol.  It's a shame there was no recognition that it was a celebration of hubby's birthday - I know they don't have to, but when I stayed at a Hilton around my 50th they left me some celebration chocolate in the room with a Happy Birthday message - it was just a nice gesture that would have been nice if this Hilton had done it too.

To sum it up, comfy bed, decent breakfast, clean, heating that worked, and a great little pub a few minutes walk away.  Yes, this ticked the necessary boxes."

Did not like the smaller than average room size and detested the bed. Mattress was so hard, it had no give in it at all, because it was hard legs kept sliding off. Hips felt bruised all the next day. Pillows were also too high and uncomfortable on our necks. We had no sleep and given the driving we were doing, this was not appreciated. Bathroom was also very jammed and small. Wifi was great and onsite parking a bonus though we had to pay £10 for it, which stinks. Restaurant staff were friendly and helpful but seriously if you want a good sleep I would recommend looking elsewhere."

Nice, quiet hotel, with clean and comfortable rooms. Big advantage of having an Imac with free internet access, so you can watch movies or browse the internet in the evening. Bar food ok, portions were not huge, however meal in the restaurant was beautiful, as well as service. We were treated with great attitude. Especially lady called Grazyna (Grace) made our evening so special. We had to leave very early next morning and she was so kind to arrange early breakfast for us which was lovely. Full of fruits and nice sandwiches and muffins. Her service was exceptional and I could see the passion in it. I would love to go back there again. Thank you very much for everything.

1887,Lowri_Bennett,2013-11-30,5.0,"Really, really good. ... But for the parking. If there was better parking I'd give it five. The receptionists were very friendly and treated people excellently - can only imagine that's because most of the hotel residents are on business trips. It's clearly a business orientated hotel, with everything so crisp and straight edged, as well as Apple Macs in the rooms, but it was perfect for a one night stop in Bristol to go to a friend's engagement do. Excellent value for money with a Dinner special, and food was very good too, although the younger restaurant staff weren't quite as on the ball as the reception, and lit all the candles around us but missed our table, even though we were one of two tables that were occupied. Also, got some sort of rose sparkling wine, not prosecco as issued on menu, however the more mature gentleman serving us quickly turned the service around in here and was both discreet and attentive so we'll forgive that especially as it was such good value. The room was compact but so light and comfortable that it more than made up for it. An excellent nights sleep followed by a very understanding gentleman at reception accepting a morning request for a late check out and breakfast due to the engagement party induced hangover. Skilful staff, excellent location, pleasant decor - made it about ten times more romantic than the supposedly romantic Double Tree Cadbury house. We would return."

You know exactly what you are going to get. All rooms are the same, with a decent size and well equipped.

Breakfast was good too. My only criticism is that all the fruit is tinned and in syrup. For a big international chain and with healthy food so important these days, this is not really acceptable. 
Toaster has been problematic a few times.

We are always more than satisfied except for the parking which I appreciate is not the fault of the hotel.  It is a nightmare.  If you are lucky enough to get a space you have to hope that others don't park on the hash lines opposite (which they always do!) as you need to be more than good at reversing out of your parking space.  Lesson 1 - try reversing in - it makes life a lot easier.  Staff and everything else we cannot fault and we keep coming back.

What a great find.  The cost was the same as the Holiday Inn Express just along the road, but the experience was significantly better.  The rooms are a little cramped but very well specked.  Your TV is an IMac, broadband is free and the Beds are really comfortable.

The food for this standard of hotel is very good.  Breakfast is freshly cooked and the staff are very attentive.  The coffee (ultimate test) is more than passable.  Dinner menu gives good choice/variety and in particular it is possible to eat something healthy.

Only issue is rooms can be a bit noisy with the traffic, particularly at the front.

I WILL be back!!"

The staff on check in were really friendly and we could check in early.  The rooms are compact but really well equipped.  There is a safe, fridge, free wifi and an Apple Mac TV.  The TV has Sky Sports which is a real bonus.  The room is really clean and comfortable and is a pleasure to spend time in.

The rate included breakfast which was really top quality and the service staff and really helpful.  We ate in the hotel and the food was top quality.

The parking was convenient and whilst you had to pay it was oly £10 per night.

I would definitely stay here again and it is certainly competitively priced.  Whilst some may say its location on Temple Way maybe a bit busy, the back of the hotel is close to Victoria Street and then on to the centre."

I asked to speak with a manager this morning to get it dealt with. The only person on is the receptionist who tells me that they are aware of it! She informed me that it only occurs when it rains!!!? This is the fifth floor of a hotel. This should have been dealt with as soon as it occurred! 
I have asked to speak with the manager but was told he is not in until Monday!
I asked for his phone number - but was given the number of the maintenance man!
This is, without doubt, an appalling service.
What other hotel would leave the continuing strong and foul smell of raw sewage where guests are paying to stay? It is unacceptable and, I am certain, against all health legislation. We were also kept awake by young adults partying up and down the corridor overnight! Wish i could add a 'smellograph'......"

Room - good, reasonable size with comfortable pillows and bed.   Clean and a sensible temperature!

Reception made a few comments in poor English before saying they would send someone up - nothing happened, 20 mins later I tried again and got an English speaking girl who advised me to check the back of the machine and see if there was anything plugged into the headphone socket - there was!  pulling that out gave me sound but I then found a Sub woofer and stereo speakers which presumably were the items that had been plugged in but didn't work.   I should not have to play with wiring !  This machine acts as your TV and as a computer with free internet access.

Around 1830, I was very (I mean very) aware of a high pitvched drone and was about to ask to move rooms but when I walked down the corridor it was evident at one end of both the 1st and 2nd floors but not the 3rd.   That said, as I was about to re-pack the bag, the noise stopped and luckily nevr came back!

During this ""walkabout"" I noticed that the fire escape at one end of 1st floor was partly blocked by a cart and the refuge area on the stairs was blocked with boxes.  When I went for dinner, I checked again and the cart had gone.  I reported the boxes to the receptionist but an hour later they were still there!

I eat in the restaurant - staff were a bit lacking on arrival but were very apologetic when I found them and remained attentive thereafter so totally forgiven.  Food was suprisingly good and menu was sensibly sized - ie. not too many items on it although for Shrove Tuesday pancakes were sadly lacking.  That said the table next to me had abviously asked for pancakes and these were cooked and delivered so again - a bonus point for service.  Overall I was impressed by quality of food although price a little on the high side.  Breakfast was also good although fired eggs being cooked to order slowed things down a bit (minor point)

Overall - some good points, one or two bad ones 

Will I stay again - yes I probably will!"
1904,693meld,2014-02-28,5.0,"Check it Out Excellent experience all round. Have stayed at this hotel previously when visiting a show held annually in in Bristol. It is conveniently located for my requirements  and is a first class establishment, clean, modern and stylish with friendly staff. Considering the standard you get in relationship to the deals available via internet sites then it's a 10/10 from me!! As a footnote, get early into the hotel's car park as space is a little limited."
1905,539philipw,2014-02-28,2.0,"Unhappy stay Where to start? Inadequate amount of parking spaces. We were required to make a £50 room deposit, I don't mind this but the promise that it would be refunded in the morning was false (three days). On arrival in the room there was no electicity (no tea/coffee, no hairdryer, no TV/iMac). Air conditioning was noisy but when turned off it was possible to hear what sounded like people urinating in surrounding rooms and turned itself back on after a while. Cooked breakfast was cold and there were no newspapers in the racks. The 24 hour convenience mart mentioned on the web site is tacky vending machines. I was also decidely unhappy with the removal of tables and chairs whilst still eating breakfast, gives one an unwelcome feeling.
  I will say the room was clean with a nice bathroom, although the piece of extruded plastic which I suspect was supposed to be a soap dish was decidely low rent and shouldn't a four star hotel provide bathrobes? The insulation from traffic noise was good. The staff were polite and efficient.
  There is a satisfaction guarantee, if you are not satisfied you don't pay, as our stay was part of a deal and so paid for in advance I requested a refund, this was not forthcoming and I haven't received any contact in this regard."
1906,THEBFB,2014-01-31,5.0,"Top Quality Hotel I can't tell you how much I loved this place

Great service on check in, lovely clean hotel, great room and happy to keep our bags for most of the next day

Breakfast was great even had a make-your-own waffle machine

What's not to like? 
Well - it's a bit of a walk into town"
1907,andrewpg2014,2014-02-28,4.0,Bristol Nice stay in a nice city. Plenty to do and see all within walking distance. Lots of cafes and boutique coffee shops in the west end and great undercover market. Hotel was very friendly but not sure about the plastic plants everywhere when you a re a garden hotel.
1908,pw1sb1,2014-02-28,5.0,"Great hotel! Lovely modern hotel with friendly staff. Didn't sample breakfast so can't comment. Staff really helpful and brought us extra tea bags when we ran out. 

Parking on the council- owned car park can be paid for remotely otherwise you have to get out there at 8am to feed the meter. Beware there is a 20p charge for using the remote online facility ,regardless of how long you pay for so its cheaper to pay for 4 hours.

Tip - ask for directions into the city and save yourself a long walk round! There is a short cut through the temple gardens."
1909,ShiresUK,2013-12-31,4.0,"Super Comfortable Room and a Convenient Location for Shopping and Train Station Rate: £99 included Dinner (2 courses), Bed and Breakfast for two.  It is a clean, comfortable, functional hotel.   Our room although smallish was modern and well equipped, super comfortable and everything appeared to be new and included an iMac TV/PC and the usual fridge, safe, desk, complimentary toiletries and wifi. The location is excellent - very close to Bristol Temple Meads train station and less than 10 minutes walk to all the shops at Cabot Circus.  Staff on Reception and in the Restaurant in the evening provided outstanding customer service.  The only let down was at breakfast where a greeting and service was non existent - I found myself a table and no offer of tea/coffee or even ""help yourself etc"".  Despite the lack of service the quality of breakfast was good.  Parking was not a problem but I think we got the last space and it cost around £10.  I will definitely return next time we are in the Bristol area."
1910,806caroll,2014-02-28,5.0,"Great Stay Fantastic rooms, luxurious, comfy and quiet. Great stay and well worth the money at £66 for a double. Parking can be a wee problematic but hey it's Bristol what do you expect! Staff helpful and efficient. Sent us to a fantastic Indian restaurant. 
Would thoroughly recommend; location is excellent too."
1911,FamilyBats,2014-02-28,4.0,"Nice hotel, room on the small side I stayed here for one night whilst in Bristol for work. Room was nicely decorated and bed was comfy. Shower was wonderful. Shame not to have a bath but so many city hotels don't these days. Nice toiletries (which was good because I had forgotten shampoo). iMac was a nice touch but it wasn't the best for watching tv in bed (i.e. no sleep timer that I could see). 

I arrived about 8pm and went in search of a resturant to get something to eat and was a bit disappointed. There is not too much close by in terms of this. 

Staff seemed very nice and it was very hassle free in terms of checking in and out. Would stay again if in Bristol."
1912,Value_Seeker,2014-02-28,5.0,"Thoroughly Enjoyable Stay Really liked this new and modern hotel. The rooms are fairly small but sumptuous with lovely toiletries, towels, bedding and carpets! The equipment in the room is super modern and the staff were really friendly. No biscuits in the room, but there were some on reception on arrival and we managed to  get a parking place! (£10 per day)

The hotel is really close to the shops, but a little further from the restaurants and bars than we thought and the prices in the hotel are expensive as are all Hilton Hotels so be warned, especially as the bar area is pretty small, so not much atmosphere.

Breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice and really fresh food as well as ample refills of coffee by friendly, helpful staff.

Thankyou, we loved it!"
1913,StellaDerby,2014-02-28,5.0,"Can't fault it 2 night stay with friends. Rooms are very spacious, clean and comfortable.....In fact, so comfortable that I had 2 of the best nights sleep that I've had for a long time! Breakfast was excellent with good choice, freshly cooked etc.
We were fortunate to be able to park at the hotel (£10 per 24hrs)although there is a pay and display car park a few yards away. The hotel is well situated and only a few mins walk to shops, bars,restaurants etc. 
The staff are all very friendly and courteous and check in and out was quick and easy.
Try as I might, I cannot find fault with this hotel!"
1914,ChrisS223,2014-02-28,5.0,"top hotel...rubbish carpark The reason i used the Hilton was for the Wales v France 6 nations match (nearest we could get at late notice) on turning up at about 3pm the car park was already full (approx 50 slots)  had to park in a neighbouring carpark which turned out to be cheaper than the hotel its self! but had to get up at 7am to buy a new ticket.
On the plus side, the staff were awesome! very polite and attentive. the room was the best for a chain type hotel i have stayed in. Not the biggest but creature comforts and style/design were second to none.When we arrived back the resturant was closed but there was a great range of sandwiches/snacks in the reception which were reasonable. overall 9/10."
1915,Geodruth,2014-02-28,4.0,"Not a Bad Hotel but Breakfast Needs an Uplift Stayed here at very short notice so not much time to shop around.  Thought we'd booked a decent sized room overlooking Temple Gardens.  Excellent check in/welcome.  We got the view (5th floor, v nice) but room was not large at all.  A double bed, desk chair and other chair filled the room and we had to move the chairs to get into the wardrobe. Liked the Apple Mac in the room, tea/coffee (no biscuits - husband sad) and no mini bar.  Not sure why.   You had to wander down to reception to buy bar items with which you could stock your fridge.  Might as well pop to the minimart round the corner.

So the room was not dissimilar to a Premier Inn/Holiday Inn Express; just a bit more pricey.

Car parking space hit and miss.  We had the last space.  Prob is that the barriers do not stop people entering the car park even when it's full so cars tend to park wherever they can and so potentially block others.

Gym small but perfectly functioning.  Free headphones which was a nice touch.

Breakfast was fine. Good selection of fresh fruit, pastries and hot food.  Bit annoying that once you had one hot drink you had to track down a waiter/waitress to get a refill.  We helped ourselves once and were told off.  Asked for an omelette one morning, chef looked annoyed, and we had to chase.  It was rubbery when it arrived but edible.  Shame - with just a bit more attention with hot drink top ups, and a smile or two from the chef, this could have been better."
1916,LittleJo_K,2014-02-28,4.0,"Modern & convenient This hotel is within an easy walking distance of Bristol Temple Meads station, which makes it ahndy. The city shopping & dining centre is a reasonable 10-15 min stroll away, should you be so inclined. I've always found the staff to be friendly, efficient & helpful.  Rooms are modern & well equipped with an iMac & handy toiletries to help you cut down on overnight toiletries too (mouthwash, shower gel, shampoo, .conditioner, body lotion, cotton buds/cotton wool)"

1919,fayedrew,2014-02-28,3.0,Parking Hotel was ok rooms small but workable. Staff were friendly and helpful. However the car parking was abysmal. On arrival there was a sign stating the car park for the hotel was full. The option given was a dark unlit pay and display car park down the road. After some persuasion a space was found for my car within the hotel car park but due to worrying that if I used my car I wouldnt be guaranteed a space we decided to rely on taxis. Due to this I wouldnt recommend this hotel unless you are visiting Bristol on the train.

The service is very nice and a good things is having a Pc in the room which works also as TV.
The breakfast is really good and you can order something (omelette, fried eggs, etc.). There is a large selection of food and the quality is good."
1924,BubblySoph,2014-02-28,4.0,"Perfect for a long weekend, great location We spent only one night in there in one of the rooms which looked over the park. The room was rather small, but still comfy and very quiet. There was a good sized wardrobe to store clothes if staying longer than a night and the chair with the desk was a great higher-end one for business people! The bed was perfect for us in terms of hardness, had a great sleep, it was a bit too high though.
The iMac was a great addition to have, however, probably not the best choice instead of a TV as it's a bit small and not the easiest to navigate from bed.
The room and the bathroom were clean and beside a couple of marks the interior didn't look worn out. The toilet wasn't spotless under the seat though..
Breakfast was a nice buffet style one (we found it better in quality and selection than the 'inn' ones), the English breakfast items were freshly prepared and filled up regularly, great range of continental items (loads of cereals, yoghurts, dired fruits..etc) and a waffle maker!! 
Staff were very helpful and polite.
There was one thing which we could not fully understand though...check out time was 12, we finished breakfast around 11.50 and wanted to go back to the room to pick our bags up and the card was already 'disconnected' from the room...? 
Overall enjoyed it and will consider booking it again."

The hotel was in a good location perfect if you want to go shopping, near the the train station, the room was lovely the Apple Mac was a nice touch but the beds well they were rock hard!!! We didn't get any sleep and we left at 5am because of this, we mentioned this when we checked out and they said they were not going to charge us the room, we didn't expect this at such a well known Hotel Company and sadly will be not using them in the future :("
1927,davidtinney,2014-02-28,2.0,"Atrocious Breakfast I've just spent the night at the Hilton Garden Inn Bristol. It is a business hotel which is an 8 minute walk from Temple Meads station. The hotel is clean, quiet and the wifi works in the rooms. One strange aspect of the room is the Mac desktop acts as the TV. This sounds cool but once I was given the remote (it was missing) the TV/Mac was not easy to navigate. 

As mentioned in the title, the breakfast was pretty awful. The (spartan) staff were dispirited young eastern Europeans who obviously hadn't worked there very long. I had to drink my OJ out of a coffee mug and waited at the breakfast bar for ages while another customer was complaining. 
If you've already booked this place then good luck!"
1928,Laradias,2014-02-28,2.0,"Nice setting ruined by rude staff. Bought a Groupon voucher for afternoon tea. Arrived at the City Inn Cafe to staff laughing under their breath and smirking at each other.

All we could hear for the first 15 minutes coming from  kitchen was shouting, to the point where a member of staff had to go in and tell them to be quiet.

Food was average and not worth the advertised full price.

Will not returning."

1930,EKCol11,2014-01-31,5.0,"Extra Touches make it worthwhile. Was down on business & booked here. Slightly dearer than other nearby hotels but not by much. Two minutes walk from Temple Meads station which has the Flyer bus to the airport. Room was great, IMac in the room which was a nice touch as was the free WIFI. I looked out the window & was on a busy main road but the window was good enough that you couldn't hear any noise. Room also had a safe & a fridge which were extra bonuses. The breakfast was amazing. Buffet but quality of the food meant it was freshly made. Only a ten minute stroll to the town centre so location not too bad. Well worth the little extra if you are down this neck of the woods."

1932,ManchesterGlen,2014-01-31,4.0,"A good quality hotel. They say you get what you pay for and this hotel fits the bill.

Parking is available but incurs a £10 charge. Street parking is available locally, but I don't know what times.

Check in was polite and efficient.

The hotel is clean and tidy and fairly new.

The room was excellent. the quality and finish are better than I expected.

The ensuite shower was also very good. powerful hot water with the usual Hilton quality.

There was hardly any noise from other residents and the bed was very confortable.

The apple computer provides the TV service.

The wi-fi signal strength was excellent in the room but the speed was poor, only achieving 1.93Mbps download and 1.07Mbps upload, which wasn't sufficient for me to be able to work on my laptop. Reception advised that the system had been recently upgraded when I advised them of the issue.

Breakfast was basic and not worth the money. tehre were the usual cereals, fruit etc bu the hot food was in metal skillets with glass lids. This meant that the condensation remainined in the skillet and mad everything soggy. next time I won't book the breakfast."
1933,ddlmillin,2014-01-31,4.0,"Fantastic..... From arrival to departure.. My daughter and I stayed here for 1 night to visit Bristol for shopping.  You know the minute you walk in and check in at reception that it is going to be a good experience.
The reception staff were really helpful and friendly, always a good start.

The room was immaculate, everything seemed brand new and the Apple mac tv was a bonus.

Shower room was light and airy and also very clean.

My only shock was the cost of a glass of wine and a hot chocolate at the bar.  £13!! Will not get caught out again but on the positive side the bar staff went to town on my hot chocolate, it arrived with a strawberry in it!

Breakfast was hot, fresh and everything was there you could want.  Drinks were available to take away if you were in a rush.

I arrived at 4pm and parked until 5pm the following day and was charged £10 which I think is good value. (made up fo rthe cost of drinks at the bar!!)
Will definately stay here again and would recommend it in a flash.. Every City should have a Hilton City Centre Hotel!!!"

1935,Sybil_Fawlty,2013-12-31,4.0,"Central location for business travellers This was booked by my company as their choice and it works really well as a business hotel.  The room was spacious and very comfortable.  I was at the back facing away from the road and it was quiet.

The advantage is that they have a car park where they were happy for me to leave my car whilst I worked in Bristol and collect it at the end of the day.

I ate in the restaurant which was perfectly OK (I wasn't paying) but the execution of the slightly ambitious dishes did not quite come off.  A simpler menu might be better but at least it was very convenient.

The other advantages are that it is not far from the main station if you are walking and I was able to walk to Queen Square in about 10 minutes which was very handy."

1944,Adarglas,2013-12-31,4.0,Saturday night stay Stayed here for a night between Christmas and New Year. It's in a great location easily found by car. The hotel was very good in all respects. The decor and facilities were of a high standard. The staff were friendly and accommodating both at breakfast and in facilitating an early check in. Best of all if you have a taste for real ale it's within a stone's throw of a number of Bristol's wonderful pubs!
1945,368royh,2014-01-31,5.0,"A good experience An excellent hotel, with modern and stylish rooms that are quite spacious. I was upgraded to a 'park view' room for a reduced charge and have to say it was preferable to viewing the road! Excellent location for visiting Bristol centre or other attractions and easy to find. In fact, a very pleasant walk into town in less than 10 minutes.  Wifi was the fastest I've encountered in any hotel and the sleek iMac computer/TV was a nice touch. All-in-all it compared very favourably with an 'apartment hotel', which I usually use in other locations. Room safe and refrigerator provided, ironing equipment in room, wardrobe (with a mirrored door) and drawers and plenty of other storage space. The general standard of furnishing was very high and everything was comfortable.  Charge for parking on the hotel site a little excessive for someone staying more than one day, but it is in the City centre and there was always plenty of room.  Overall an enjoyable experience and definitely a place I would stay at again."

We were on a bed and breakfast basis. The breakfast had a very good selection. 
The hotel is modern and the staff were all very pleasant and efficient.

1948,joshual2014,2014-01-31,4.0,"Nearly everything. Great hotel, very ""ronseal"" (does what it says on the tin).
I'd not hesitate to stay here again if the need arises.
Stayed on the top floor and it was silent! (NYE)
Everything worked, it was clean, what more could you ask for.
iMac was handy - we even used it to order late night food in!

The only real downside was the parking, massive let down.
Admittedly we arrived late to the hotel (9ish) but there's nothing worse than arriving at your destination then having to go and search for parking. Again I know it's a central location but somehow this should be resolved... I really didn't appreciate having to get up for 8am to run down and pay for parking either.

At checkout I heard a couple of people grumble and go through the satisfaction guarantee, what rubbish. I'd like to pass on my curtsey to the good job that reception did - unfortunately I understand that somethings, namely parking are simply out of their control. I do however hope that management read this and do something about the abysmal parking situation - far too few spaces relative to hotel size... this is a hilton!"
1949,Strifae,2013-12-31,5.0,"New Years Eve Stay - Brilliant! We stayed here for new years eve in Bristol 2013.

It is a well lit up and very modern looking hotel and gives a great impression on arrival unlike some of the other hotels in Bristol which can look quite drab from the outside. We checked in very quickly and the friendly chap behind the counter explained all about our room and the fact we had an iMac which was also our TV/DVD player and computer which is something I haven't experienced in a hotel before!

The room was absolutely lovely, very bright, modern and comfortable. The iMac was brilliant for watching TV to using the free internet to look up things to do and places to go that particular evening. There was also free WIFI but as we were on the very top floor it was incredibly slow (I didn't drop a rating for this because of the free iMac internet and also the WIFI is totally free)

The beds were very comfortable and you had Neutrogena free toiletries in the bathroom including mouthwash, shower gel, shampoo/conditioner, moisturiser etc. The shower was hot and had high pressure what more can you want?

The hotel also has a spa/gym but we didn't get an opportunity to use this, will try it next time!

The breakfast was very nice with a good selection - I personally recommend the waffle which they made fresh for you which is shaped like the logo of the hotel which is a nice touch!

There is a bus stop immediately outside which goes right into the City centre every 10 minutes or so, and is only £1 for a 3 stop to just outside Broadmead (It is walking distance but the weather was terrible)

The Car Park is £10 but they let you keep the car there for a little while after you check out the following day which is a nice touch and there is additional parking down the road, although we saw people who had parked there for free overnight obviously forget to buy parking and they had tickets - so word of warning

Will stay again - Thank you"
1950,percan,2013-04-30,5.0,"Perfect location even if you want to go to nearby cities We had a brilliant stay at Hilton Garden Inn last year. I do like staying at Hilton Hotels. Garden Inn is a value brand and still you get the quality service and immaculate rooms. Bristol City Centre is no exception. We had a lovely and quiet stay. The breakfast is good. The car park is small, but we were lucky to find a space and found the parking fee reasonable. Easy access to train station makes it a perfect location even if you want to go to Bath or Cardiff. Walking to the city centre is also easy."
1951,GeorgiaB1264,2013-12-31,5.0,Spot on! A fantastic hotel conveniently placed in the city centre & an easy walk from the railway station. Rooms are a tiny bit on the small side but to make up for his have iMac computers and free wifi!  Breakfast was great - who can say no to waffles?!
1952,johnrK3798KV,2013-11-30,4.0,Convenient for Bristol city centre The hotel is ten minutes walk into the city centre.  Given it's only a stone's throw from the office I was visiting I wasn't going to look elsewhere.  The en-suite rooms are on the small side but are adequate and clean. I experienced no noise from the busy A4044 Temple Way outside.  The rooms also have free wi-fi.  Breakfast is what you expect to find in this type of hotel with continental and full English options available.  The dinner menu is limited but the food is excellent especially the steak.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Had everything the business visitor to Bristol could ask for.

The staff are quick to meet your needs and the hotel has many of the creature comforts that are needed for the business traveler.  Location is also good with many sites and services within a short walk

Nice modern, clean rooms with imac. Staff are nice, friendly and welcoming. Food is excellent value for money, would definitely return.  Had a small light bulb issue and it was sorted when i returned to my room with a card and a box of maintenance mints - nice touch :-) ! Very impressed with the efficient, happy service from Hilton Garden Inn, will book again for next years anniversary."

I will continue to stay here as long as my contract lasts.  A top hotel."
1956,janetmsj,2013-12-31,5.0,"Very comfortable I stay here whenever I need to stay in Bristol for work.  It is much more comfortable than other hotels of the same type, and the beds especially are lovely with lots of big soft pillows! I haven't used all the services on offer so i can't recommend them but i (and other colleagues) like the atmosphere there."
1957,ChuckSid,2013-12-31,5.0,"Christmas Shopping Trip We recently stayed here whilst Christmas shopping in Bristol. We arrived at the hotel at 11:45am and cheekily asked at reception whether our room was ready. The receptionist happily found a room that had been cleaned and very kindly also explained the quickest way to the shops and also told us about the Christmas market that was taking place.

The room was very clean (spotless) and contained an Apple iMac which doubles up as your TV. We were at the rear side of the hotel and the room was very quiet. Room facilities were excellent and also included a fridge and ironing board. 

The buffet breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice. All the staff were extremely polite, friendly and helpful. The hotel was the cleanest that we'd ever stayed at. The car park is quite small so would advise getting there early and was £10 for the night. A great hotel which we would highly recommend."

If this is full you are probably in for a long walk.

1970,680alanr,2013-10-31,5.0,"Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre October 2013 This Garden Inn is conveniently located.  City bus stops in front of hotel, Temple Mead train station is just a short walk away, and the National Express station is about 5 BGP by taxi.  Rooms are clean and quiet, though more compact that Garden Inns in America.

My wife and I set up base camp in Bristol to explore the area as tourists in late October.  Perfect!  More to see and do than can be described here.  And the people we met were those you'd be proud to introduce to anyone!

A special mention concerning the Garden Inn staff at this location:  Gracious, exceptionally helpful -- and honest!  My wife left some rather valuable jewelry in the room when we checked out.  Didn't notice the missing item until we had returned to America.  A phone call to to Sazilvia Dani at the hotel produced more than a little relief.  The jewelry had been located and was on deposit in the hotel safe, awaiting reclamation.  No small task in repatriating it to America, but Szilvia's persistence has been very much appreciated.  Stay here and you'll have no regrets."
1971,GKellyBirmingham,2013-12-31,5.0,"Excellent stay Booked this hotel for a night away for my friends 40th birthday as we wanted to be near to Bristol.  Drove and arrived around midday.  I knew that the car park was first come first served and we were lucky enough to get a space.
I imagine that if you arrive later you probably won't get one, (that isnt really the hotels fault though!) although there is another pay and display across the road at the back.  We left the car there until Sunday afternoon and paid £10.00 parking fee which I didnt think was that bad, as there are not many hotels near the centre with parking.
Check in was smooth and friendly and it was good that we could check in early.
Our room was a twin at the back (I had requested a quiet room as the ones at the front face the main road and may have experienced noise from traffic).
The room was perfect, very clean, a Mac which doubled as a PC and TV, it had a couple of music channels which was good when we were getting ready!  The bathroom was lovely, spacious, clean, nice powerful shower, heated mirror, soft towels and lots of goodies (bath/shower gel/shampoo etc).
The lady on reception was very helpful with directing us.
Cabot Circus (main shopping centre) and the Christmas German Markets were about a 10 min walk.  Also visited St Nicholas Market, which is good and lots of bars/restaurants and quirky stalls ....again, about 15 min walk (or 5 mins in a taxi on the evening).
Had a good night sleep, beds were very comfortable.
Breakfast was buffet style and there was a lovely selection - hot or cold and also things to order too.  Very tasty.
Check out was fine and friendly.
Overall, it was a great stay and very convenient - Train Station (Temple Meads) was a 10 min walk and we caught the train to Bath (well worth doing that!).  If you need something to eat and cannot be bothered to go into the centre there is a Wetherspoons about 5 mins away by the Train Station (Temple Quay) which is handy."
1972,vc1406,2013-12-31,4.0,"Meeting venue Used the hotel as a meeting venue with lunch. 

Car parking awful, let the hotel down completely. Small tight car park which is a dead end, entered through barrier, drove down 45 spaces (or so they claim, appears smaller) to find it full, you can then only reverse out as no space to turn, then find yourself at the barrier again which you could only get through using a ticket from reception, meaning you have to leave your car blocking traffic to go into the hotel to get let out. Stupid. 

On the plus side, meeting room and facilities good, toilets clean and well managed and food was AMAZING. Restaurant staff helpful, although our allocated 30 min lunch break took double that. Receptionist also helpful.

I would return just for more of the high quality food, but get the train as Temple Meads is only a 5 minute walk."
1973,Manda1979,2013-11-30,4.0,"as expected, pleasant stay We have been to Bristol several times although tend to use the mercure holland house. We saw an offer for an overnight stay with 3 course meal and wine and decided to stay here for a change.

Firstly it was easy to find near temple meads station, as we arrived later on Saturday PM the car park was full however parking on the road was free after 6pm and for Sunday so we did that instead saving a few quid.  Check in was quick, and we prebooked a table for dinner. Pleasant clean and adequately sized room with a park view therefore quiet. Very comfortable bed and good range of toiletries. Free wifi too.

Dinner was very good, and service was excellent.

After dinner we were going to head off into town for drinks but instead wandered over the road where there is a basic but pleasant enough wetherspoons pub which was fine for a few drinks.

Would I stay again? Yes, however for us the mercure is a better location.  We felt this was a little too far for the places we like to visit and therefore it would not be top of our list. The main shopping area however is walkable, as is the harbour side, albeit harbourside was a fair trek.  

Overall though, absolutely can't fault the hotel and staff."
1974,LikelyCulprit,2013-12-31,4.0,"Stress free Reviewed once before, when a few minor details let it down. Pleased to say that on this occasion the entire stay was hassle free. Yes, one might agree it is a tad bland but I find it clean, modern and above all comfortable. They don't stand on ceremony, and for a business stay it's ideal. Any downsides? All my group had problems as they couldn't quite get to grips with billing the company as per the booking (confirmed in writing) - seemed to want bills settled there and then although this was put right quickly and with apologies. And the breakfast temperature still doesn't quite reach above lukewarm. Minor gripes which I wouldn't let me stop from booking again."
1975,ccchapman,2013-11-30,3.0,Bland uncomfortable  business users venue made up for by one helpful receptionist  Stayed here 2 nights as it was advertised as being in city centre but in reality it is a hike to the nearest shops or places of interest.The rooms are adequate albeit too hot and beds very hard.  We didnt have breakfast but a night cap in the bar was pricey . The receptionist Saturday evening was  off hand and flippant when we remarked on the lack of hot water For a shower that morning .The duty receptionist Sunday  more than made up for this by his pleasant and helpful demeanour and offer of a complimentary snack together with an  explanation of the buses and looking  after our bags for us. The hot chocolate from the bar on return from shopping was delicious. Despite initial impressions and one unhelpful staff  would return.

We arrived at 10.30am as we wanted to do some shopping and the car park was chockablock. However we waited 15 mins until another guest left and went in to pay for our parking. We were told our room was ready which was a fantastic bonus.

Breakfast was lovely and really good value and we loved the free cookies were given before we went out in the evening!

1979,PiggyD,2013-10-31,5.0,"A friendly, comfortable and well located hotel The Hilton Garden Inn provides very good accommodation within walking distance of the city centre - and it's on a main bus route if you disagree with that! Staff are excellent. The receptionist was superb and helped with directions to the city centre and other questions. Staff in all areas smiled and said hello in a relaxed way. Rooms are reasonably sized and include a iMac which doubles as the TV. Breakfast is excellent for the price. Just one complaint. We were promised that a Hilton Honours card would be mailed to us. It never arrived. We'll still return!"

Great central location. Only grip is that the carpark is £10 a day for guests! Travelodge down the road is only £7.50 per day and it's not like the Hilton carpark is any more luxurious!"
1981,JonC547,2013-11-30,5.0,"Really nice! I expect these chains to be a bit impersonal and downmarket, but this was surprisingly enjoyable. I was delighted to find that the window of our room opened a little, so the air con was not needed and we slept extremely well. The room was at the back and overlooked a park, so was very quiet: worth asking for a room at the back, then! (But some rooms are above the outdoor smokers' area, so beware the faint drift of smoke!) 

Another interesting experience: I was about to book a room online for £79 but when I realised this would not include breakfast, I decided to phone and check the cost of breakfast. The person at the Hilton call centre obviously picked up on the scepticism in my voice and immediately said she could offer the same price but breakfast included. Then she said she had another special offer of £89 which would include the 2 breakfasts and 2 two-course evening meals. Which I went for! And the food (veggie) was certainly above average. And only a 15-minute walk from the city centre and riverside."

The check in was smooth although it was very busy the staff were fantastic,  we eat in the bar classic burger and chips,  very tasty and filling. Breakfast was included in our rate and was a comprehensive hot and cold buffet, and included the most delicious scrambled eggs"
1986,inspec71,2013-11-30,3.0,"Not bad, if you can get a good deal. We stay in Bristol regularly and have used many of the city hotels. Never tried this one before. At short notice, they had the best rates in town, so gave it a try. 

The hotel is easy to find on the outskirts of Central Bristol. The car park is small, and charges £10 per 24 hours. Get there early to secure a space. The hotel is a short walk from the harbourside area, and 10 minutes on foot from Broadmead and Cabot Circus shopping. We managed to get checked in at 1030, which was excellent.

We went for a standard double room, which felt quite small, particularly the bathroom. The first room allocated was right next to the lifts and they creaked and clanked through the wall, so a new one was requested and sorted immediately. The bed was comfy but creaked. Facilities standard - tea, coffee, toiletries and a fridge.

We found it difficult to get the temperature right during the night, but otherwise spent a quiet time on the third floor, with very little noise from communal areas - this is unusual for a Bristol hotel on a Saturday night!

We didn't use the restaurant or bar except for breakfast, which came with our room rate. Breakfast was very good, as long as you don't pay the full price. A good selection of items, nicely cooked and presented. Staff a little stressed.

The decor felt a little tired, it's not the best location in town, the car park is pokey but all in all, it was pretty decent and we would consider going again if the price was right."
1987,PhilippaM25,2013-11-30,5.0,"Impeccable service This was our first time at the Hilton Garden and we were both very impressed with the room and the service. For the price we paid (£48 for a Friday night) we had certainly not expected to have an i-Mac in the room (this doubles as the TV) together with nice extras in the bathroom - mouthwash!. When we checked out, my husband mentioned that there were a couple of lights not working in the bathroom and the £10 parking charge was waived. We chose not to have breakfast as we didn't feel that we would manage to eat £12s' worth of food. We will definitely stay here again."
1988,KoriS64,2013-11-30,5.0,"Lovely room and fairly good breakfast food, unfortunately hard to understand staff's accents. Everything in this hotel was lovely, the style and decor of the lobby and our room was very clean and modern. The computer and wifi was complimentary but I would have payed extra for them if that had not been the case. The Pavilian pantry in the lobby and also the mini fridge in the room was very useful. The only negative aspect I can comment upon was that I found the accents of most members of staff was difficult to understand most of the time however they were all incredibly helpful despite this. I would definitely stay here again."

However, there were a pair of soiled underpants left in the room to our dismay. We were moved to another room and given complimentary drinks.  We opted for a weekend package. When we arrived in the restaurant, they gave us a menu and then promptly took this away and gave us the package menu. With very little choice and the food was below average, stodgy and microwaved, my husband most of the time in the bathroom with an upset stomach.  The following night we had to go to a concert early and the restaurant wasn't open. To be fair to the bar staff, we were allowed to eat in the bar earlier. However, when they produced the menu, it was exactly the same as the previous night. We said that we didn't want to eat from this and they bent over backwards to make us happy by letting us choose from the bar menu which was heaps better."

1995,Distant_Dreams,2013-10-31,4.0,"Good Overall Experience We stayed at the Hilton for an overnight stay as a city break and were fortunate to have a 3 course meal and bottle of Rosa as part of a promotion (Double Room, Queen Bed for £89).
On entering the hotel was clean, décor was modern and reception was pleasant and very helpful.
The room was well laid out and had all the amenities that we required, including an Apple computer setup with TV facilities.  The only factor that stop us giving a 5 rating was the shower was unpredictable and one minute the water would be at an ample temperature, then suddenly go cold and then hot.
We ate at the hotel’s restaurant and on entering the reception we was greeted by a member of staff asking if we would like a complimentary pumpkin drink. 

The food in the restaurant was very good, although had to explain a couple of times prior to eating that we were on a promotion to (who we think was the Restaurant Manager) and what that included.

The hotel is a five minute walk from the station.  There is a bus stop outside the hotel, which we took to the suspension bridge and walked back the hotel via parks, museums, cathedral, and art exhibitions (mostly down hill walking).
Overall a very good experience, great value and would recommend."

The bar is decent and The rooms are brilliant and each room has an apple mac. Bristol city centre is a 10 minute walk away which is perfect if you've had a few too many!! Only reason this doesn't get 5 is because of the breakfast, other than that its great!!"
1998,VIVAHUME,2013-10-31,5.0,"Modern, Clean and Centrally located I stayed at this hotel for 5 days while on business in the area. The hotel came with a reasonable price (~104 GBP / night incld breakfast) and a great central location (<5min walk from Temple Meads).

Check in was a breeze. I asked for a room on an upper floor (just because upper floors are generally quieter) and was accommodated. My room looked towards the back of the hotel , and was very quiet. 

The Daily breakfast has a great variety and should suit anyones needs. They offer a range of cold cereals, fruit, mead, cheese, breads, croissants, muffins, eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, tomatoes, yogurt and the self-serve waffle machine. You can also have eggs cooked to preference. I had an omelette and the only minor complaint I could make was that they didn't have any options of vegetable to put in it. I'm from Canada and am used to omelettes full of vegetables (peppers, onion, spinach, etc..), I ended up with ham, mushroom & cheese - a very minor inconvenience.

The room was very clean and modern. It featured an iMac in pace of a regular TV which you could use to watch TV, surf the net, or whatever else a mac can do. There was also free wifi throughout the hotel and the reception in my room was fine to video chat back home. The room also had a mini fridge (empty) and a small safe. The shower was hot and water pressure ample.

The hotel also has a small but adequate gym that has a few treadmills, cycles, do-it-all machine and some free-weights. Just fine to stay in shape while on the road. I did not find (mind you I didn't ask either) a pool/steam-room or sauna on site. 

Check out was also very simple. Standard checkout time is 12:00pm, I requested a late checkout and was offered 1:00pm. Not a huge difference so I checked out and made use of temporary bag storage while checking out the city a bit on the last day.

There are plenty of amenities well within waling distance of the hotel. Bristol city centre is <10min walk where you can find many restaurants,pubs, etc..

All in all, I have no complaints and would both recommend this hotel and stay there again."

A number of the staff remain and are very friendly and helpful and do recognise you when you return (thanks  Aga ) The hotel has a car park for guests, it can get busy and on one occasion we had to park in pay car park next door and move the car when space was available.We have always enjoyed our lunches here, if  you enjoy vegetables you may need to order more than come with the meal. The dining area can be a bit noisy as they do have conferences at the hotel.There is a terrace over looking a small park ideal for drinks and lunch on a sunny day. We recommended friends to stay here they came by train and it is a short walk away from Templemeads station ,there is also a bus stop outside. They found the hotel ideal for a weekend break and they could to most areas of interest."
2000,rabbiton,2013-11-30,5.0,"pleasant weekend break All was Very good except that the noise from the heating fan kept us awake, the room was lovely and clean, there was no bad smells or signs of and stained walls or floors, Im not sure if we were not charged for the coffee or if it was free anyway but ""Thank You Hilton for a lovely Coffee""  The food was included with our booking and both the Dinner and breakfast were first class, the bacon was the tenderest and tastiest I have ever eaten . And Bristol shopping was quite good as well, just 10 mins from the Hotel."
2001,MartinT125,2013-09-30,4.0,"Modern, stylish hotel in a central location Car parking was quite restricted, but we managed to find a space. It was only lunchtime, though, and later in the day it might be an issue. Check in staff were very friendly and efficient. Our rooms were airy and clean, and nicely furnished. An Apple iMac doubles as the TV, providing internet access and full desktop computing facilities if you need them.  Bathroom was clean and well provided with quality toiletries.

We didn't have an evening meal, although we did have a night cap in the pleasant bar area. Breakfast was great, a very full choice of hot and cold buffet choices. The waffle machine was a nice touch, and the lady who took care of the buffet and cooked things to order was a joy to talk to.

I would recommend this hotel for a city break in Bristol, for a business visit or for a stay with someone special."
2002,Malikhey,2013-11-30,5.0,"Perfect for a comfortable night in Bristol. We decided on a whim to visit Bristol for the night, and booked at the Hilton Garden Inn because of its good reputation and proximity to the train station. 
Plans changed and we ended up driving to the hotel- it was easy to find but the car-park was full and so we used a privately owned car-park just down the road. 
The room was very clean and tidy, not the biggest hotel room I've ever been in, but it felt cosy rather than small. 
The iMac/tv was a nice idea, however when we first loaded it up, we were met with a screen full of hardcore pornography. We initially found this hilarious, but not so much when we considered what the previous occupants may have been up to...
We had dinner in the restaurant which was all delicious. The service was very good also. 
There isn't much else to say: a good location, well decorated and staffed by very capable and friendly people."
2003,913roberte,2013-10-31,5.0,staying in bristol We have had a lovely peaceful stay whilst being right in the centre of Bristol.  There's a very pleasant park nearby so that we could start and end the day peacefully.  Our room overlooked the park.  The invitation to use the fridge in the room for our own snacks etc was really welcome.
2004,guy_of_gisbourne,2013-11-30,5.0,Excelent Value Stayed here for a second time and got a £99 season break- had a lovely dinner for two included and the breakfast buffet was fresh and tasty and plentiful. The hotels well located and the staff very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely stay again and recommend.
2005,974julieh,2013-10-31,5.0,"enjoyable stay this was the first stay, but it won't be the last. Friendly staff, welcome reception lovely town. Looking forward to next visit! can't wait. Location suited our needs. Car park on site, made big difference when staying in a busy city. Nice walk along the river side with plenty of bars, cafe's plenty to see on route. Hideaway pub looks like your next door neighbours house but what a welcome inside."
2006,PeterJRoper,2013-11-30,4.0,"Excellent weekend break 
Comfortable, stylish and quiet rooms, friendly staff, good restaurant but limited choices on dinner menu. Good breakfast. Overall very enjoyable and good value. Suggest you park in Water Lane car park nearby if car park full as car park that hotel suggest is max 4 hours and you have to be there at 8am sharp to pay!"
2007,715stephenl,2013-10-31,5.0,"feedback i can only speak as i find,what an excellent stay i had at this hotel, the staff were all courteous to a fault, and the breakfast quality of food and service excellent, the room was also clean and fresh,the only small fault i could tell was quite a bit of road noise with the window open,but then it is a city so dont let this detract you from staying there, an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable stay."
2008,MMTS,2013-10-31,4.0,"Good value, helpful staff We had an advanced purchase 3+ day stay deal. It was great value for the accommodation. We were in Bristol for a wedding and staff were very helpful in providing info regarding all we needed to prepare for the occasion. It was a short walk to lots of restaurants."
2009,GracieDundee_UK,2013-10-31,5.0,"Best Budget Hotel I've stayed in My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night (October, Friday to Saturday). We had a double room over-looking Temple Gardens. I can't really fault this hotel for the price. The room was quiet and spotless. The check-in was friendly and hassle-free. Breakfast was good, we esp. liked the option of having our eggs cooked to order and the use of a waffle maker. The location is great 5 minutes on foot to Temple Meads Station and an easy 10 minute walk into town. Will def. stay here again."
2010,Matty07uk,2013-10-31,4.0,"Good bet for city stay Just spent the weekend here having stayed here a couple of years ago when a MINT hotel. Hotel has maintained a good level of service, nice rooms, free wifi but with Mac in room do not even need the wi fi. Breakfast was good, Sunday was a bit manic with the usual rush as everyone seemed to enjoy the extra hour with clocks going back but staff coped well, no running out of food. All staff were helpful and location is great if using the train plus just a short walk into city centre. Very quiet as well for a weekend in terms of noise both inside and outside hotel. 

Would definitely stay here again as hotel has maintained good standards over last couple of years and normally good deals to be had with Hilton."
2011,owlsman,2013-10-31,5.0,"Ideally located The hotel is ideally located from Temple meads train station but is also not far from Cabot Circus and Broadmead shopping centres.The room was very nice ,clean and comfortable with an iMac which doubles as a TV and computer - the hotel has free Wifi which is very helpful.There is a bus stop outside the hotel so you can get the 8/9 bus which starts from Temple Meads - you can also go to Clifton using this bus.Breakfast was very good ,a comprehensive selection the chef will do waffles too order.The staff were very friendly and and helped to make my stay in Bristol a very pleasant one."
2012,SCFBracknell,2013-10-31,4.0,"Comfortable stay, overpriced bar Clean, comfortable hotel as expected from a Hilton. Limited on-site parking but we managed to squeeze in. Staff very friendly and the service levels are good. Room was well appointed and comfortable. Breakfast was very good quality for a buffet style arrangement. Only slight irritation was the price of some of the drinks in the bar. I'm happy paying over the odds for alcoholic drinks but £3.90 for a pint of lime and soda was the highest I've encountered anywhere...."
2013,eechiwawa,2013-10-31,4.0,"Pleasant stay helped by pleasant staff I have stayed here a few times now on business. As comfortable as it is, I must say it is the staff that have added to the experience. They have been helpful and pleasant, making business trips more enjoyable."
2014,TrewinDorset,2013-10-31,5.0,"Convenient location, good room & breakfast We chose this hotel based on good reviews and its convenient location near Temple Meads train station.  As a bonus there was also a bus stop right outside, so it was really easy to get around the city during our weekend stay.
The room was clean and well equipped, free wi-fi & combined PC/TV, tea & coffee facilities with readily available additional milk etc.
Breakfast very good - cereals, yoghurts, fruit, pastries, bread and cooked options including eggs prepared to order.  Juice, tea & coffee - hot chocolate on request.
The staff were helpful and friendly at breakfast and at reception - happy to store our luggage for us on early arrival and for late departure.
All in all a really good stay - would visit again."
2015,daranr,2013-10-31,5.0,"Clean, comfortable, convenient Excellent property for the business traveler, particularly those on extended stays. Park side rooms are comfortable, clean, and quiet, and the on-site laundry is very handy. Property is well run, very clean, and conveniently located within a short walk to the Bristol Temple Meads train station. Staff are very helpful and receptive."
2016,Vivs45,2013-10-31,5.0,"Miles of smiles We stayed one night while breaking our journey from Edinburgh to Cornwall. We were very tired on arrival, but were much cheered because everyone in the hotel smiled at us; not in a cheesy way, but as if they really meant it. Our room was spotless and very comfortable; excellent pillows! (I'm very fussy about pillows ... ) Dinner was on the edge of being pricey, but was so delicious we decided it was worth it, especially as they altered the menu to suit my mushroom allergy with ... guess what? A huge smile!"
2017,pammyk187047,2013-10-31,5.0,"Handy for Temple Meads Station We stayed here for one night as we went to a gig at Colston Hall. The hotel is easy to find and is about 5 minutes walk fro the station. Check-in was quick and efficient. We were on the 3rd floor, our room was very clean and large enough for a short stay. TV and computer are combined, we managed to get the TV to work but not the computer. There was no milk with our tea and coffee but they quickly rectified that. The bed was comfortable and there was an alarm clock next to the bed. The air-conditioning was loud but. The bathroom was a decent size although the shower door leaked. Breakfast was included in our tariff and was good. Fried eggs and waffles were cooked freshly by a very friendly lady. There was plenty of bacon, sausages etc.
It took us about 15 minutes to walk into the centre of Bristol. There are plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants nearby. I would stay here again."
2018,151Mike151,2013-10-31,4.0,"Welcoming Staff Efficient at check in, smile with it. Breakfast staff hardworking, friendly in a nice way, and lady i/c of breakfast area very pleasant, courteous and helpful.
We found the hotel's position excellent for walking to train station, and the Tesco wine tasting. In addition it was not far from the centre of Bristol (walking).
Next to an actual (city) garden you are afforded a lovely view, must have been great sitting out with a drink and snack through the wonderful summer.
Negative was the loud air con in the bedroom, but, the room was well fitted and provided all our needs and more."
2019,mrsmin_10,2013-09-30,4.0,"Clean and comfortable, very good stay. Stayed here for 1 night on a dinner deal, no breakfast. Business trip combining leisure, this hotel is very clean and comfortable, the room a bit on the small side, shower access a bit cramped but had everything we needed! Dinner was excellent but watch out for having to pay extra for sides like bowls of chips, ie. things you'd normally expect to be included in your meal. Very attentive restaurant staff, shame the receptionist was not as good. She was a bit frosty, especially when we arrived early, but she did let us check in. This hotel is perfectly located across the road from Temple Quays and Temple Meads station just a short walk away. The car park is tight, needed a 20 point turn to get out, wouldn't like to get a large 4 wheel drive round it!

Would use this hotel again and recommend it."
2020,MrsWS-2013,2013-10-31,4.0,"Very pleasant stay Booked 2 nights here and had a very pleasant experience. The room was tidy with the usual amenities (safe, en suite, freebie bath products, tea/coffee, hairdryer, mini-fridge, A/C) but also had the added extra of an imac which doubled as a tv, so this hotel is definitely ""business class"". Nice firm bed and plenty of pillows! Our room was road-side but we had no problems with traffic noise at all. Situation was good, roughly 15 mins walk to the city centre. Breakfast was fab with plenty of choice (cooked, continental, cereal, fruits, pastries, muffins and waffles), and the staff were all so helpful and welcoming. Only downside is the parking: there are limited spaces and the car park was already 95% full before 3pm on the day we checked in - be prepared to reverse the length of the hotel to get out again! Despite that would definitely recommend."
2021,Defector,2013-10-31,4.0,"Business as usual My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Bristol for one night. We booked a park view room. The room was spotless, lovely firm mattress and clean bathroom with a nice strong walk-in shower. The room was a bit small but still pretty comfortable. Our room was on the fourth floor as far away from the elevator as possible, so it was quiet enough to enjoy a peaceful night's sleep.

As we stayed on a Friday night we managed to get a seasonal special that included a two course dinner and buffet breakfast for only £110. My wife chose a starter and main, while I went for a desert and main. The food was well presented and very tasty, even though the portions may have been somewhat on the small side. The buffet breakfast was without any fault.

The parking is a bit tight and I guess it could be a problem during the week, but as this was a Friday night and we arrived at 18:00, we had no problem in finding a parking spot in the smallish hotel car park. Take note that there is an additional £10 charge per day to use this car park.

All in all a satisfactory stay that could not be faulted in any way. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
2022,GilesD407,2013-10-31,5.0,"great location and facilities Really helpful staff. Mac computer in every room for ease.Lovely breakfast with lots of choice.

2023,Centaur66,2013-10-31,5.0,"Bargain overnighter with lovely trimmings! Stayed at this hotel on an impromptu trip to Bristol to see family last weekend. Paid only £119 for two adults plus brekky for a delightful room with a park view and a veery comfortable stay. Other family paid a bit less for a premier inn nearby but I'm glad we opted for the hilton garden inn. Wonderfully helpful staff that were willing to go the extra mile, immaculate, well provided room with fridge, aircon, apple iMac + free wifi! decent mugs for a cuppa! gorgeous soft towels! beautiful toiletries and little freebies! iron and ironing board and hair dryer. Comfortable bed and fab shower too! Breakfast was outstanding as was cafe menu....didn't get to try restaurant as out for dinner! Only possible criticism....not enough plug sockets and need another by the bed and parking is a pain if no room in hotel car park (£10 hotel overnight - on street on sat afternoon £4 til mon morning) That aside it was a great night's accommodation for a decent price! Totally recommend x"
2024,hargrave,2013-10-31,3.0,"OK for a couple of nights. We decided to stay here on a long weekend as we had stayed in a Hilton before. this one was not quite up to our expectations as the room was small with only one comfy chair, the other was a computer swivel chair. The room was clean, bed was firm but ok but the bathroom was too cramped. Imac was ok once we had sort it out but the lack of wifi was annoying. Although the view at the back was obliterated by huge trees it  was better than the noisier front on the road.
Location is good just ten minutes from the main centre.
We had breakfast  both days and compared to the last Hilton it was disappointing although we can't comment on the hot food the choice of fresh bread was poor and you clashed with the people waiting at the toaster. One thing we always enjoyed was the fresh cut fruit but here cheap tasteless tinned Pineapple isn't good enough.
The staff were excellent particularly in giving directions.
We probably would stay here again as at least we would know what to expect."
2025,N9282ZNdavidh,2013-09-30,4.0,"Night Out Big mix up with booking of 3 rooms. Wanted 3 twins but were given 3 doubles. Staff did sort it out in the end but it took nearly 2 hours, so our day out was delayed (they did give us a couple of free drinks for our troubles though!)."
2026,Em0866,2013-10-31,5.0,"Always an excellent stay This, again, was a very comfortable stay for one night.  The service from check-in until check-out is second to none, with the staff on front desk helpful and friendly.  The room was clean as was the bathroom.  The food in the restaurant was well cooked and was waited by friendly and helpful staff.  My only grumble was the lack of free wifi during this stay.....but it did not ruin my stay.  Thanks again for a great stay and I am sure I'll be back again."

2028,Anon533,2013-08-31,4.0,"Great for a short break Really like this hotel, the staff are friendly and the location is good, also, the food is really tasty! There are a couple of draw backs... the rooms are not huge, but are very pleasant and clean. Also, you get an imac in each room which is a great idea, but you do need a 'proper' tv after the novelty wears off!

I really like this hotel, but it caters more to the weekend visitor than it does to a business traveler."
2029,Jon0706,2013-09-30,4.0,"A lovely stay Hotel was comfortable, staff very friendly, buffet breakfast excellent (especially the freshly made waffles). Parking was a bit of an issue, but nearby car park owned by hotel offers free parking from 18.00-08.00, but then max stay is for 4 hrs only. Luckily got a space in the hotels parking area the following morning. Wireless internet didn't work in our room when attempting to connect to phones and ipad, but this was kindly made up to us. Overall, good stay, would recommend."
2030,adriant961,2013-09-30,5.0,"Very nice hotel/ professional staff Very pleasant stay, spotless room, excellent staff, only negative was parking a little challenge when other guests parked in areas they shouldn't have been, making it awkward to get out of parking bay however there was free car park u can use between certain hours."
2031,Jack5764,2013-09-30,5.0,"Clean, modern, friendly Reception staff were friendly and efficient. Room was a reasonable size, modern in decor and spotlessly clean-  with iron & ironing board, iMac for TV & radio and wardrobe. Although I had a room facing the main road, the double glazing was so good that I wasn't disturbed by the traffic noise.

The bar man was friendly and drink prices very reasonable for a hotel. 

Located just a few minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads station and 5 minutes from the city centre. 

I've stayed at the hotel a number of times and it has always remained at a consistently high standard. The only downside is the small car park, although I understand that alternative parking is nearby.

Happy to recommend."
2032,Mates69,2013-09-30,5.0,Loved this place. Stayed here one night in September. Great modern room. We had a three course dinner with our room rate and the food was sensational. The staff are all very professional and the quality of the room decor is classy. Close to the city and a short walk to convenience sltore. Breakfast was also of a high standard.
2033,JohnLonsdale1965,2013-09-30,4.0,"Good hotel, lack of parking. Arrived at 18:15 and took the last parking space. Car park is small tight and a single lane wide, meaning you have to reverse its entire length when you drive to the end and find no where to park. 
Checking in was efficient, staff were very helpful giving us a map to restaurant we were booked into. Bar staff were excellent, agreeing to open up when we arrived late and serve a couple of rounds of drinks. 
Room was comfortable, bed was good and allowed a good nights sleep. But not convinced by use of Apple desktop as a TV as it was small and clumsy to use. 

So overall nice hotel, excellent staff, but limited parking and naff Apple PC masquerading as a second rate TV."
2034,24Cox,2013-09-30,5.0,Modern and welcoming Just stayed one night to attend a family gathering. Speedy efficient checkin/checkout  Very impressed with modern room very slick with apple wifi/tv/radio and lovely comfortable bed. Would definately recommend a stay here.
2035,78ChrisS78,2013-09-30,5.0,"Fantastic Booked this hotel for a birthday weekend which was a lucky guess as lots of hotels to choose from in Bristol. I was really lucky as this was a fantastic Hilton. from the moment we walked in you could see that lots of work had been done to guarantee a very pleasant stay here.
The check in was faultless and the room was brilliant with all of the mod cons you could wish for including FREE WIFI throughout ( other hotels when will you stop charging ). each room had its own Mac PC as well as speakers and cables. The bathroom was immaculate and bed very comfy.
All of the staff were extremely helpful and downstairs by the bar a fridge full of snacks and frozen meals you could help your self to (for a small charge).

Well done Hilton Garden Inn.."
2036,Annem2602,2013-09-30,4.0,"Great hotel in handy location with friendly staff I stayed here last night as part of a group. I was very impressed with the hotel, it was smart, clean and convenient.  The staff were the right mix of friendly and professional, a special mention to the two night reception staff, one called (Polish spelt) Peter and his British collegue who was very kind and helpful when we had a problem in the night.  The breakfast was excellent, a wide selection and was available all morning.  We had a room over looking the church ruins, for a Saturday night (with the window open) it seemed quiet.  The bed was very comfortable, duvet just the right weight and pillows so comfy I took a picture on my phone of the label so I could search and buy one of my own.  I did not use the bar or other facilities so could not comment.  My only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars was lack of parking spaces but solved this by some of our party parked a little way up the road paid £1 from late afternoon till 6pm then it was free overnight.  Many thanks again to all the hard working staff for making our stay a pleasure."
2037,mscarroll1978,2013-09-30,5.0,"Great service and atmosphere We used this hotel as a base for our University reunion last night.
This is a lovely hotel with very friendly and helpful staff.
The rooms are very well maintained and equipped. Considering it is right on a main road, the sound proofing offered by the triple glazing is superb, didn't hear a single thing all night.
There's free wifi throughout and a Mac in each of the rooms.
The bar was so inviting and quiet, we returned early from the hustle of the city centre to carry on our evening there.
I wouldn't hesitate to return or recommend this hotel."
2038,EzraCornell,2013-09-30,5.0,"For the price, wow, what a stay I had just come from London and paid 4 times the price of this hotel and this one was 4 times better. First, it is a Hilton Garden Hotel NOT a Waldorf.  So the room as small, but, modern. The bathrooms are small but have what they need to have.  The IMacs are a nice addition because you do not have to go to the business center to do certain things.  Finally. The staff. They were professional, friendly, and represented Hilton well.  For £54 - what a great stay."
2039,MrFozziedoggie,2013-09-30,4.0,"Almost five stars....but Property is nice, new and modern. Staff is mostly helpful, I found the Eastern European staff a bit aloof, but that's probably a cultural thing; no one was rude. Great location if arriving by train, short 10-15 minute walk to the marina/tourist area. Now why they only get ****, the rooms utilize iMac computers as the TV set (former Mint Hotel left-over), made watching TV difficult unless you sit two-feet from the screen. Especially difficult during sporting events such as tennis (Australian open). If they switch out to a full-size TV, they become five-star for the category of hotel they occupy. Definitely recommend this property."
2040,AliciaPhotopoulos,2013-09-30,5.0,"Value for money! Excellent service! We were greeted at reception by Ana, she was very friendly and helpful with information about Bristol. Excellent service! The room was a comfortable size, very clean and the shower was one of the best ive experienced in the Uk. The added bonus of a mac to use in your room and the ability to print for free was awesome! The only negative was the carpark, we got there and it was full, the funny thing was that it just stopped at the end and you had to reverse all the way out to get out. There was no where to turn around. Luckily there was street parking which was cheap. But all in all for the money we paid it was excellent value!"
2041,ColinHawk,2013-09-30,5.0,"Value for money Hotel well situated to explore Bristol on foot. Well maintained, rooms light and airy with all facilities. Staff very helpful. Did not have any problems during stay. Breakfast very good as usual with Hilton."

The Bar didn't stock a lot of well known drinks, and checking out was painful. In addition the car park was full, so I had park at NCP overnight and renew my parking ticket at 8am in the morning to avoid the parking fine."
2043,crystal9078,2013-09-30,4.0,"very nice hotel but not great start We usually stay at Doubletree in Bristol, also a Hilton, as we like it so much but had a very good rate with breakfast at Hilton Garden so thought we'd give this Hilton a try.Arrived late at just gone 9pm.and asked at reception when the restaurant closed. We were told it was 'just closing' but we could have bar snacks. Went to the bar, saw the restaurant doors were open and we asked about dinner. The staff said they weren't closing for orders until half past nine! Strange.
With this exception, everything else was good. The hotel has an intimate warm vibe. Very friendly and courteous bar and restaurant staff. The girl at the bar mixed Bacardi and diet coke just as I like it; with lots of ice and lemon and right to the top of a tall glass. Perfect!
Rooms were clean bright and modern, mac in the room a great bonus. Bed rather small but very comfortable.  Missed having a bath and prefer one but the shower was fine, good pressure and very hot water. Excellent location, Many restaurants and bars very close, including Pizza Express and Costa. Close to shops and harbourside, cathedral near too,

Great location for the city centre. 
Food was great only downside, took 2hrs 20mins to get my bar snack. Did get apologies and comp drinks but that did not make up for the lack if service and poor excuses given for the delays. 
2nd night got great service but had a hair in my pepper sauce. Sorted personally by the head chef and again complementary meal. 
Breakfast is lovely, but they advertise that it starts at 6 but I never managed to get any hot food before 620. As it was not out. Also on the last day sat in the restaurant on my own for 20mind before I even saw a waiter. 

Great hotel but needs to dirt it's service standards out."
2046,BinaryMoon,2013-06-30,4.0,"Nice and modern The Hilton Garden Inn is a nice modern hotel in a great location. Close to the city and the station it's ideal.

Being a computer geek I think having a Mac in the room is a nice touch - although as a tv it's a little small.

The rooms are well provisioned and have everything we could need.

It seems there was a stag do at the hotel when we were staying there - but it was still nice and quiet and we got a good nights sleep.

The breakfasts are quite pricey - and don't have the best selection for vegetarians who like a cooked breakfast (adding hash browns would make a big difference) - however for me the waffle maker makes up for it. I love the waffle maker!"

The computer mouse in our room didn't work, however within 15 mins of telling the front desk staff we had a new one delivered and set up. We had a 'park view' room, which was modest but comfortable. The bathroom was on the small size, but had a lovely spacious shower. All the rooms come with a iMac TV/computer and have free wifi, which is great and very unusual."

2052,611ElaineS611,2013-09-30,5.0,"Great Hotel Spent two night here. Great rooms, wonderful food and friendly service. As a single lady business traveller it was ideal. AppleMac in the room, comfy bed and complimentary toiletries. Bristol also a great city for a weekend visit."
2053,gordonh776,2013-09-30,4.0,Leisure stay Clean pleasant hotel. Very helpful staff. Nice clean rooms a little on the small side but reflected in price of stay. We selected it because of proximity to Bristol Temple Meads station and it was indeed only 5 minute walk away
2054,JonRunEng,2013-09-30,5.0,"Fresh clean hotel, close to bristol centre We stayed here for my wife's birthday. There was a special offer on which included dinner bed and breakfast (for less than many of the other 4stars offered b&b only) The room was very plain in style, but the furnishings (iMac, white glass table tops etc) meant it didn't feel cheap. It had the feel of a spa, which made for a very relaxing room! The iMac was a great touch letting us use the Internet without messing about with wifi. More rooms should have it! 
Staff were friendly and flexible, not too officious! 
We at in the bar, food was typical pub type food, well cooked with little twists, but lots of deep fried starters. Breakfast was as good as I've ever had, and served til midday on weekend (a pleasant touch). Now the only real negative: parking, the hotel has a limited car park, it was full when we arrived but we ended up squeezing into a 'gap', which the staff reassured us would be ok as long as we didn't block anyone else. So we got lucky! If we hadn't found this gap, we would have had to park in the pay and display down the road! That has a 4hr max stay on it! Overnight (6pm -8pm) is free BUT: the sign says overnight is for permit holders only, a theory I didn't want to test! And I didn't want I have to get up and 8 to get a ticket! And then have to move the car in 4 hours! Maybe ok for the business traveller but not if your staying the weekend! As I say, we got lucky and on that basis fully recommend the place! A day trip to bath on the train was a highlight for us!"
2055,happyeater,2013-09-30,4.0,"Clean, modern, decent hotel Good clean, comfortable and modern room with access to a mac computer that doubled up as TV. Snazzy! Although I had difficultly using the TV (even though I do own an Apple TV). Seemed to skimp on bed linen. Only had an undersheet and duvets seemed very plasticky and rustled a lot. We managed to get a good deal but prices on later inspection had shot up dramatically. I think you are only paying for the Hilton name.

The hotel on first sight may seem a little out of the way, located on a ring road. However, it is only 10 minutes walk from the Waterfront but wouldn't walk there alone at night."
2056,plymleevi,2013-09-30,4.0,"very good Our second stay here,it won't be our last,the hotel is great.breakfast is lovely.location spot on for shopping,harbour,Colston hall and Temple meads station.we got the train to Bath ,which is only 15 mins away on the train.perfect for a weekend city break."
2057,MrNick60,2013-09-30,4.0,"City Cafe Bar, Temple Way, Bristol City Cafe Bar attached to Hilton Garden Inn in Bristol business district may not be cheap but the accommodation, staff efficiency & pleasantness made for a change to what you so often get. The food was made to order, so fresh and of good quality. If you need somewhere for leisure or a business meeting over lunch this place is to be recommended."
2058,GailHjelt,2013-09-30,4.0,Lovely hotel this was a really nice hotel.  Very Friendly staff:  Good food and was cooked well.  A very short walk to the city centre.  great market with lots of bargain and very diverse.  would definitely go again. only one problem which was the noise in the dining room.  very echoing.

2064,chiselstone,2013-09-30,4.0,"Budget-ish facilities with premium-ish touches Hilton Garden Inn is, first and foremost, a budget hotel, so tune your expectations accordingly. The price, though, seems a tad bit higher than other hotels in its class,  probably because of the Hilton brand. That said, the slightly premium side can be seen in the comfort of the rooms with good bedding, nice furnishings and quality toiletries. 

The hotel is nicely located about 5 minutes walk to Bristol Temple Meads railway station. Not too far from the life as well, being 10 to 15 minutes walk to Cabot Circus, St Nicholas Market, and the Harbour area. 

All in all, a more than satisfactory stay. A bit pricey for a budget hotel but worth it if you can get a room on discount."
2065,Alexoswestry,2013-09-30,5.0,"Great Hotel, Fantastic Staff Stayed here on a stag weekend. Hadn't stayed in a Hilton before, but will definitley again. The rooms were well equipped and spotlessly clean, and also very comfortable. The Hotel is in a good central location, with a three or four great pubs within 2 minutes walk. The breakfast is the best buffet style one I have ever had, with the waffles being especially delicious. Many thanks for a great weekend, especially to Mike, the evening bar attendant, and to David the wine champion, who wre both incredibly helpful, and for whom nothing was too much trouble. It really made a refreshing change from sullen hotel staff in other places."
2066,tjgfitness,2013-09-30,4.0,"A lovely hotel We stayed here on a Sat night to celebrate our anniversary.
We arrived at 10.30 am and were happy to be able to park easily and a lovely receptionist was able to check us in.
I had e mailed before hand and had asked for a high floor quiet room and that was exactly what we got. 5th floor and the room was on the front of the hotel but heard no noise at all and I am a very light sleeper. 
The room was lovely. Very bright and smartly done. It was quite small but that didn't bother us .A nice I mac in the room which was a tv too with good channels.
The bathroom was small but nice and clean with a good shower.
The room had a safe and a fridge but the fridge was throwing out warm heat. We didn't realise this until we came back late at night so didn't bother mentioning it. There is free wifi.
When we returned that evening the hotel had left us a card and a bottle of wine for our anniversary which was such a lovely touch and that goes a long way. Little things like that can really make a difference for people celebrating a special event.
There is a small gym which has some good equipment. 
The breakfast experience for us wasn't one of the best. Although we did go down probably the busiest time. 9.30 on the sunday. Breakfast is served till 12. The dining room was full so we sat in the bar area. That was ok though. I felt where the food is laid out is a little congested. Not very pleasant for the people sat near the buffet as people are squeezing past. There was queuing for the eggs and we gave up on that as our other food was going cold. The food could have been hotter. Also we do prefer to be given a coffee pot so you can pour it when you want it.
The quality was good though. Maybe just avoid the busy times at breakfast and the experience will be more pleasant.
This is a lovely modern hotel and in a good position for the harbour side and only 10 minutes to town. Parking might be a problem depending on what time you arrive.
Overall this is a good hotel and would definitely stay again."
2067,bromleyav,2013-09-30,5.0,"Excellent hotel The hotel is well sited close to the centre of town and in a relatively quiet and green area.  The room was very good, bed comfortable and free internet via an IMac which doubled as the TV.  We were on 5th floor at rear of hotel and it was quiet for a city centre hotel.  Breakfast, which was included in the room rate, was excellent and the service throughout was courteous and helpful.  Parking on site is somewhat limited and first-come, first-served although reception staff said overflow parking was available at a nearby public car park (free between 18:00 and 08:00).  We were told that on-site car parking was £10/night (also sign on entrance to this effect) but after we had paid we discovered that the barrier lifted without payment being necessary!"
2068,joangL4745DN,2013-09-30,4.0,"good service and comfortable The hotel is well located for Temple Meads rail station and not too far from Bristol Airport. The staff are friendly and helpful.

2069,PuertoPollencaFan,2013-08-31,5.0,"A lovely place to stay This was my first stay in Hilton Garden Inn Bristol - and I was not disappointed. I arrived early, and needed to get some work done before my room became available. I was immediately shown the business room, with free access to excellent computers and printer, and free internet. Unfortunately the printer didn't work - although I did not personally need it! Within the business room there was also complimentary water - excellent touch!.
I got an excellent room, very comfortable bed, excellent IMAC come TV, and very spacious and well designed bathroom. Could not fault anything.
Had my lunch outside in the sun, and had a few pints, all served by friendly staff. Breakfast was also great, good selection, with waffles and eggs made on request! Great!"
2070,WillG624,2013-09-30,5.0,"Clean, modern and comfortable Found a great deal for this hotel and have absolutely no complaints! The room was certainly not as small as some of the reviews seem to make out, and the addition of a computer was very useful for finding our way around Bristol and planning the next leg of our journey. Having a fridge and an ironing board in the room also saved us a lot of hassle. 

Slept very well thanks to the big comfy bed and there was very little noise as we were at the back looking over the small park. The hotel was perfectly situated as a base for us to do everything we wanted in the city. 

Only thing to mention is that it might be worth trying to arrange some parking beforehand as the hotel parking is limited and expensive. We pre-booked a space just next to Temple Meads car park which was inexpensive and just a five minute walk away. Also worth mentioning is the absolutely lovely housekeeping lady who found us more coffee - thanks!"
2071,patriciaWigan,2013-08-31,5.0,Excellent location It's near temple mead station it's easy to fine .1 st  time I drove to it from the north  2 nd time I drove from the south I found it 1 st time . It's a  very quite hotel . Stayed here twice both times had excellent service both times . We over look the gardens. Breakfast you serve yourself it was lovely .
2072,278davide,2013-09-30,5.0,"A real surprise !! 1st time stay in this hotel, but come to Bristol quite regular, stay was driven by price, but was very pleased that the stay here was just as good as other hotels that attract a higher premium !!  The rooms and facilities were great, excellent location for the train station, but a bit further walk to the harbour, which would be my only minor issue, but that really is the only negative thing I could say.  Clean, quiet hotel with good facilities."
2073,lizg765,2013-08-31,5.0,"Standard hotel made special by great staff Hotel was modern, clean and well located for the centre with a very comfortable bed.   The Mac in the room is a good idea but the rooms were very cramped as has been mentioned in other reviews and the bathrooms were really tiny.  It was quiet during the night as we had a park view room although I imagine the busy road at the front would be a problem for front facing rooms.  The hotel staff overall were pretty good but the staff in the restaurant at breakfast were exceptional, always friendly, smiling and helpful and so hard working as it was always busy.  We stayed there for a week in August so saw them every morning and they started our day off brilliantly, the management should be aware of the absolute treasures they have employed there.  The breakfast itself was very good and it was also possible to have eggs and waffles and things cooked to order.   Another good thing is the small fridge in the room instead of the ubiquitous and usually over-priced mini-bar, so it was possible to have cold drinks or fruit, etc which is welcome when staying any length of time in a hotel room.  We didn't need parking but the car park seemed quite small although a pay and display was nearby, however there is a bus stop right outside which is very handy for local buses which run to the main areas for visitors.  We were able to take one to visit the Clifton Suspension Bridge which was so convenient and the round trip ticket was very reasonable, although it was a really easy walk to the centre, restaurants, the floating harbour, etc.  Thank you again to the staff in the restaurant."
2074,davidgold,2013-09-30,5.0,"Quality hotel, good location, excellent service Stayed here for two nights in September 2013.

What I liked :
- Room. My fifth floor Queen Evolution room was not large, but beautifully fitted out and the large window with a park and city view made it seem larger. Lots of natural light but also excellent curtains to darken the room for sleeping. Comfortable bed, storage space, tea and coffee, work desk, everything you would expect from a Hilton. Nice bathroom, strong hot shower, nice toiletries.
- Internet. There is a large iMac desktop computer in the room which also is the TV and music player. it comes with a desktop sound system as well. This is a great addition to the amenities provided and is in keeping with the modern and fresh feeling of the hotel. Usage is free. There is also free wi-fi available if you have your own laptop. It was a little unreliable  in my room but it didn't really matter because of the iMac.
- Service. This was uniformally excellent. Annie in particular on reception was excellent, but everyone was professional, friendly and gave the feeling of a good hotel. Printing, scanning and emailing of documents was easily and efficiently handled by reception.
- Location. Five minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads station and 10 mins easy walk into the centre of Bristol. 
- Breakfast. Without being exceptional it was good. Buffet style, plenty of variety and the restaurant looks out to the street and a lovely park.
- Fitness room. Small but very modern and spotless with cardio, free weights and a mulit-use cross-over machine. 
- General ambience and attention to detail. This hotel feels new and modern. Everything is spotlessly clean and feels fresh. Nice quality fittings, linen and furnishings. 

This is an excellent choice for a stay in Bristol. Not right in the centre, but an easy short walk and if you're arriving by train, it's very close to Temple Meads. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended."
2075,djdavemo,2013-09-30,3.0,"Is this really the future? I hope this isn't the future of hotels for the uk, as its really not very comfortable. Everything about this newish hotel seemed very nice. It's clean, has nice facilities. Each room has an iMac, and the breakfast is great. BUT everything is tiny!!!
The rooms are tiny. The bathrooms are just plain uncomfortable. The restaurant doesn't have enough space to walk around the tables if there are more than two people stood up at any time. 
Here's a tip for you if you're going to install red hot halogen bulbs everywhere... Make your ceilings higher!!! Ok I am very tall, but most places I went, I felt like my hair was on fire! The lifts and the bathrooms are particularly bad. 
I expected this to be similar to garden inns in North America. What I actually got was something half the size. 
Oh and you can't walk around your room because the only floors pace left is taken up by a large rotating chair."
2076,Curly_Wurly,2013-05-31,4.0,"Decent, clean, friendly, good sleep! This hotel doesn't warrant a huge review, but if you are looking for a decent, clean, friendly hotel where you can get a decent nights sleep during a stop in Bristol then book this one. The Mac's in the room give it the edge over the standard chains nearby, parking could be limited though as there is only a row of spaces out the front so on a saturday night you may struggle to get a space - and i dont think you can prebook. However as it's bristol, theres bound to be an NCP nearby to rob you :)"

If you do get on street parking ts on a meter with a 4 hour maximum stay.  As for the heating / cooling in the room, you get a dial with a + and a - on it, so you have no idea how much to turn it to warm up or cool down the room"
2080,727shaunp,2013-08-31,5.0,"Shaun P (searching for Gromit) Stayed over the August bank holiday for 3 nights, first visit to Bristol especially to do the ""Gromit Unleashed"" trail. The hotel was excellent, especially considering what we paid for B&B. Very close to Temple Meads station, only a few minutes walk, one of the reasons for selecting this hotel as we did not arrive until 11.30pm. Nice clean and modern room, decent size shower cubicle and good quality soap and shower gel etc. We had a very quiet room at the back, overlooking a small park. The choice and quality at breakfast was very good indeed, cold meats, pastries, choice of breads, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurts and all the usual cooked items (including eggs fried to order and proper good quality sausages). Also, something I have never seen in a hotel before, a machine for making your own fresh waffles (delicious). My only dislike would be tea served from a flask and not in pots. Would certainly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again."
2081,stuw182,2013-08-31,5.0,"Outstanding hotel for the price! We paid just £77 for the night - we didn't expect much... (but it was a Hilton, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised!) We got a good-sized clean room with a comfortable bed, great selection of toiletries, good sized desk with two chairs! There's even an iMac in the room! - which coupled as the TV and radio - even had half decent JBL speakers attached. The location of the hotel was great, only a short walk from Bristol Temple Meads Railway Station and a short walk into the town centre. Best of all, make-your-own waffles for breakfast! Amazing!"
2082,paull25,2013-08-31,4.0,"Nice hotel, central location Great little hotel right in the centre of Bristol. Rooms are well equipped (kettle, ice bucket, iron, etc) and clean. Beds are firm but comfortable and the shower is nice and powerful.

Staff are friendly and welcoming, my later check out was granted without issue.

Breakfast is nothing special.... Not upto a Hilton breakfast, but does the job with limited fruit choices and a real mix of hot items. Help yourself to coffee and juice.

I said the same about the Garden Inn in Birmingham, the IMac as a TV in the room is a real gimmick, but the screen is so small i would actually prefer a normal TV... I dont sit in bed with my contacts in and the screen is tiny!

Wifi is fast and free!

My only gripe would be the car parking! Unless you are there at 3pm (check in time) you won't get a space! I paid £10 a night to park but as the barrier wasn't down all weekend you could probably get away without paying (i mentioned it at check out, lesson learnt next time!)

Nice hotel would certainly book again."

A ten minute leisurely walk brings you to the riverside selection of great restaurants and bars and evening 'Buzz' then on to the central promenade.
In House cafe does great breakfast which is heavily discounted if you book with reception the night before and their coffees etc are all served cheerfully with nice outdoor terrace - weather permitting!

This hotel is located few minutes walking distance to Bristol railway station which suited us well as we decided to travel to Bath by train and leave our car in the hotel car park which came free with our booking via expedia.  It is one of the smaller Hilton hotels we stayed in but it is pleasant enough.  Staff are very professional and polite.   Breakfast was good, again not as much choice as other Hilton Hotels but I guess as this hotel is smaller it cannot accommodate bigger restaurant area and more choice.  I would stay there again if I return to Bristol. It is ideal for the short stay and conveniently located in quiet area."

2090,andreasbln,2013-08-31,3.0,"highway motel with unfriendly parking This is a typical Garden Inn, clean small rooms and bathrooms, no charme - it seems more an hospital than an hotel -, good breakfast. A good highway motel, nothing more. But the parking... Hotel´s own parking has a limited number of places. If you find a free place, ok, if not, you have to park in a public parking 150 meter far; now, the public parking is in the absolute darkness, and you can not leave there the car, pay, and forget your car till the time of going away, no - you have to wake up at 7:55 am, and go to pay at 8:00 to avoid a ticket. I did not want to park in a such uncomfortable place, so after a eight hour trip I had to wait about 35 minutes outside the hotel, for somebody leaving the hotel´s own parking. Can´t Hilton have some agreement with the City of Bristol, to allow guests to pay in advance at the evening? If you travel by plane or railway, it is a good place for one or two nights. An iMac in rooms, a good idea to surf the web, a bad idea to watch TV - too small screen. Not easy to reach, labyrinthic path even for GPS."
2091,loz51,2013-08-31,5.0,"What a great weekend The staff at this hotel are really the nicest we have ever encountered. They were seemed happy in their job. From check in to the bedroom staff. The staff in the restaurant were fantastic.

The only thing was the menu. It had only 3 things on the main course and we were staying 3 nights on the wine and dine deal. It turns out you do not get breakfast for a start and if you were a veggie all you could have was macaroni cheese for evening meal. 
The menus do not change even the soup was tomato and basil every night Don't get me wrong the food I had was excellent to choices are rubbish. But my husband and our friend had the pork and it was bland they said.
I had rang Hilton main switchboard to make sure of the deal and he assured me we would get breakfast. On Thursday night I rang again regarding times as we wanted to go to the theatre. He informed me that we only had one bottle of wine per booking for one night and service started at 7 (wrong it is 6.30 and we got one bottle of wine per booking every night but no breakfast) so be aware."
2092,SimmoFamily,2013-08-31,4.0,"Bank Holiday weekend break A great hotel. Excellent clean bedroom with superb IMac computer/TV. The room was compact but totally suitable to our needs. Excellent shower and again it was clean and well resourced in terms of towels and toiletries. The hotel itself was very good and well kept. Great location and walking distance to the station (we travelled by train- a good way to avoid parking and hassle!) and also the main attractions Bristol has to offer. At check in the staff were polite and friendly and as we arrived early on the Saturday morning offered to store our bags so we could venture out until our room was ready.
My only gripe was breakfast. Not the food- this was very good and plentiful- but the wait on Sunday morning (25/08) was poor. The hotel seemed to be very busy and as people arrived at the café they had to give their room number to a member of staff and wait for a free table. Not a problem if you only wait a few minutes and it is done in order but we were somehow forgotten and in the end we simply found a table ourselves. There seemed to be some sort of staffing issues as there were a number of table left not cleared and people hanging around for a table. The breakfast area itself was quite cramped and in hotels of this size I have seen much larger serveries and sometimes two to spread the load.
Monday was better and even though we had to again wait a few minutes we were given a smile and a coffee! 
Overall an very good stay and a great weekend- just find a better system at breakfast!"
2093,BGMUK,2013-06-30,4.0,Good for city Helpful staff. Disabled accessibility is let down by small lift which barely accommodated my small mobility scooter. Staff were excellent and breakfast choice very good and well presented. The home baked bread is a good start to the day.
2094,118yvonneh,2013-08-31,4.0,"Pleasant stay A very welcome, good choice for a mini break. We stayed for 3 nights and the room was near perfect. The bathroom although small was super clean and well equipped. The room itself was big enough and well equipped. The reception staff mainly friendly and helpful but lack of smiles we read about in the review before we booked were sadly lacking with our main receptionist who booked us in. However other receptionists smiled readily. The restaurant was pleasant but something needs to be done about the awful toaster, the food was excellent with lots of choice. If you order the starter chicken and chips from the bar, be very aware that they are very well seasoned in fact far to much salt was used. The hotel is within easy reach of the town centre and railway station but a bus service passes the door of the hotel and is relatively cheap. 
The head housekeeper was extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble for her. We would definitely stay here again."

Reception staff were really friendly, hotel was very clean and only 10 minute walk into the heart of the city! On sight parking is limited but all of us managed to get a space."
2097,ite03,2013-07-31,4.0,Short but enjoyable stay Stayed here one sight night whilst on a stag party.  The rooms are clean and well presented.  Location is great and the breakfast was the usual hotel buffet fare but hit the spot after a big night out.  The car park was jam packed when we got there so was difficult to find a spot but overall the place was really good and would definitely recommend.
2098,poppy57,2013-08-31,5.0,"Stylish modern hotel Had a 2 night stay at this hotel which used to be the Mint Hotel. Very clean and modern rooms with free WI Fi and imac TV/computer. There is a pleasant outdoor dining area which overlooks a quiet road. The hotel is a 10 min walk to the shopping centre . Although room service ends at 10pm there are ready meals and snacks that can be purchased from a vending machine and heated in a microwave. The hotel car park is £10 for 24 hours but there is a public car park at the end of the road past the hotel . This is free from 6pm to 8 am (There is a notice saying that only permit holders can park overnight, but the hotel has a permit and the barrier isn't put down) and then you can pay £1/hour for max 4 hours. Useful if you are arriving late/ leaving early. We were out from 10am until 6pm so only cost £2 to park."
2099,RossBennett,2013-08-31,3.0,"Better than I expected Stayed for 3 nights and this hotel was much better than I was expecting, it compared favourably with other 'full' hiltons I have stayed at. Service was good, room service only after 5pm and a limited menu but this suited me and the food was well presented and tasty, only downside was that I had to call back room service for my desert!
Parking is very tight, be confident at reversing as there is no where to turn around but I did find a space okay and there is also a nearby public car park.
The position of the hotel is brilliant, a nice walk through the park at the back of the hotel brings you into town.
My room was at the rear of the hotel and was very quiet. TV was watched through the computer but this was okay. Room was clean and bed comfortable.
I would stay here again."
2100,MITCHELL-W-UZEEL,2013-08-31,5.0,"Hilton Quality Enjoyed a great, but short stay in this Garden Inn hotel. Location is great. One big compliment for Annie, the receptionist. She's a lovely woman, very helpful and a big asset to the hotel if you'd ask me."
2101,OldburyTourist,2013-05-31,4.0,"Stylish and clean Very clean hotel in a reasonably central location. We stayed as part of a deal which included a 3 course set menu evening meal. The food was ok, but not amazing. 
Our room was well equipped, including an iMac and designer furniture. 
There was a problem with roosting seagulls over the car park, which meant a number of vehicles looked very worse-for-wear after being parked for a few hours. We had to wash our windscreen before we could drive off, which is not great for a £10 per 24hr charge. 
The carpark was the only negative point however. Overall, this is an impressive hotel with good facilities and a nice central(ish) location."
2102,Lytham,2013-08-31,5.0,"Very pleased Visited for a 3 night stay in August, excellent room very clean. Only a smallish bathroom with shower and no bathtub but more than adequate. Staff extremely friendly particularly in dining room.  Breakfast very good but perhaps a little restricted on choice of fruit at breakfast. Well positioned for walking to Bristol centre, shops etc. would definitely use again"
2103,davidhchess,2013-08-31,4.0,"As good as before..... We have stayed at this hotel a number of times before and always use it when visiting Bristol to see a relative. 

We arrived mid afternoon on a Friday and took the last parking space in front of the hotel. Parking is at a premium here and, though there is a car park to the rear, it is a good idea to try to arrive as early as you can to get a space.

Check in was competently handled and we were able to access our room immediately. The decor was modern and light. Coffee and tea making facilities were provided (though getting extra milk cartons each day seemed tougher than it might have been) and a fridge was available. As before, there was a reasonable amount of wardrobe space. 

A desk, an Apple computer which doubled as a TV and a reasonable number of power points were provided though the business traveller might wish for more space and the TV remains a little small for modern tastes. Free wifi is a major plus.

We had a double bed which was a reasonable size with a summer duvet. The duvet was a little on the short side. I had asked in advance for non feather pillows. These were not at first provided and making them so seemed more difficult than I had anticipated. 

The bathroom was as before though this time around everything worked satisfactorily. As other reviewers have noted, only a shower is available.

I was pleased to hear that the hotel is no longer taking bookings from stag and hen parties, though these can of course book indirectly through third party providers. This time around our sleep was not disturbed.

We ate breakfast in the restaurant and service was good even when busy. The buffet options were much as you might expect though the packets of cereal and the absence of decent wholemeal or granary bread were disappointments. We did not eat dinner in the hotel but ate three light bites for £12 between us which was ample for an evening supper for two.

The hotel is ten minutes away from the city centre and close to Templemeads station and remains a very good choice as a centrally placed, reasonably priced Bristol option."
2104,ChrisD_9,2013-08-31,5.0,"Super hotel, excellent value Could not fault the hotel for the price paid. Rooms are a little compact as are the bathrooms but the quality of everything makes up for that. Loved the apple mac  & Herman Miller chair,  everywhere was lovely & clean, very comfy beds with crisp White linens. Very good shower. A comfortable & peaceful night followed by a delicious buffet breakfast. Will definitely use this hotel again."
2105,Morag63,2013-08-31,5.0,"Great City Centre Hotel We booked this for a  saturday night, so we could enjoy the city & celebrate a 21st birthday.  Good Value, Clean and very comfy beds & pillows.  The in rooms facilties were great.  Hairdryer, iron & board, fridge & ice bucket, tea & coffee and computer/tv wifi & air conditioning.  I was worrid that being so cetral and near the train station it might be noisy, but it wasn't.  I will look forward to returning, when we next have a late night in Bristol.  Well done Staff of the Hilton."

Rooms were very nice and clean. Service and reception team superb. 
Hotel is located 5-10 min walk from the main Bristol attractions right next to the Bristol Temple train station (and airport shuttle bus)
It was relaxing & easy stay!
Hope we will be back soon!"
2108,SueCat82,2013-08-31,4.0,Another Hilton hit Stayed for one night on the 14th August for a pre holiday shopping trip. First impressions - smart and stylish. Reception staff were excellent from check in to check out. Room was small but perfectly formed. Everything you needed from a hotel room was spot on and extremely clean and fresh. The IMac was a great touch and there was free wifi throughout the hotel. Bed was super comfy which with the quietness fab to recharge the batteries.  Had afternoon tea from a Travel Zoo voucher.  We had paid the slightly higher price to include a lovely bottle of sparkling rosé and the cakes and sandwich selection and amounts were really good value.  Breakfast was one of the best I've had in a Hilton with plenty of choice and all very fresh.  On our last day we popped back for lunch and even though the City Cafe was very busy (as used extensively during the day for business meetings) the service and quality of food was excellent. Special mention for Dave who had a smile on his face even though he was dealing with many customers in the rush.  Had an excellent rate from Hilton Honours Great Getaway for £68 I think which was amazing value for money B&B. We will definitely be back. Thank you :)
2109,yhi904,2013-08-31,2.0,"Great hotel badly let down by Dinner service We stayed for a few nights at this property whilst in Bristol sightseeing.
The hotel is really very good and reasonably priced and it is just the restaurant which badly lets things down.
The hotel staff are all very friendly, efficient and helpful and went out of their way to make to make our stay enjoyable.  Both check in and check out were quick and both on the way in and out we were able to have our luggage stored so that we could make the most of our days in Bristol.
The rooms, as others have commented, are not large – but they have everything required including plenty of teas and coffee, free WiFi, hanging and drawer space, a laptop safe, fridge you can put your own things in and the Apple TV/Computer.  Beds are super comfortable with great pillows and duvet.  The bathroom has a good shower but no tub – fine for a few nights.  In the reception area there is also a small shop selling soft drinks, biscuits and hot and cold snacks (microwave available for the hot ones); this is a nice touch particularly if you want something late at night.
The hotel is in a great position for Temple Meads Station, the Bristol Ferry and is a 10 minute walk into the heart of the city with plenty of buses close by (including one to the zoo) if you don’t feel like walking.
But now to turn to the bad!  We had one evening meal in the restaurant and to say it resembled “Fawlty Towers” is an understatement.  We waited five minutes to be seated and then another thirty minutes for our order to be taken; in that time we were totally ignored and not even offered drinks.  In fact in the end we attracted a waitress’s attention else I suspect that we would have never been served.  Had the first night’s dinner not been inclusive in our room rate I would have probably left at that point.
After our order was taken the drinks appeared quickly, but it was a further half-hour before our starters appeared – a salad and soup.  In all it took nearly 2.5 hours to have three courses by which time I couldn’t face another wait for coffee!  Given it is a simple and very limited menu and the restaurant was not that busy – most tables had only one cover and several were empty – it is just unbelievable why it takes a hotel restraint this long to deliver a meal.  And whilst our waitress tried her best to keep us happy, there seemed no acknowledgement from any of the hotel/restaurant management that there was a problem.
Breakfast was little better.  The food is very nice – when it is there – but they were constantly running out of things.  Often there was no reserve supplies to bring out – which may be forgivable on a Sunday when it is more difficult with deliveries, but this was a problem on Friday and Saturday too.  For the most part it was customers telling staff food had run out and there seemed little proactive going on to keep things stocked.
I would thoroughly recommend the hotel and breakfast is OK for a few days, but avoid taking dinner here at all costs."
2110,GillR750,2013-08-31,5.0,"Great value We stayed for one night en route to Cornwall to have a bit of time in Bristol exploring the area. I booked the Hilton Gardens online via Trivago for £71 but was please to find a 10% discount code so only paid £63-worth looking around for a deal as this was an absolute bargain since it included breakfast. The hotel room was small, light, very modern, and extremely clean, The iMac was a brilliant addition even though we didn't spend enough time there to make use of it. The bed was really comfortable and we had a good night's sleep. Great shower too. The buffet breakfast was excellent, fantastic choice of food and though we were still full from our Indian meal the previous evening as soon as we smelt the breakfast we couldn't resist. Nice to have daily papers to read while eating. All in all a really good experience for us, we don't stay in hotels very often so want it to be an enjoyable time which this was. I read on other reviews about £10 parking fees but this wasn't mentioned to us and as we used the quick checkout (there was a queue when we are ready to leave) perhaps we just got lucky. One word of advice, if you book online via Trivago or similar make sure you have all relevant paperwork-I printed out the confirmation form but there was a problem when we booked in as they didn't seem to have us on their system. However the receptionist was really helpful and dealt with it without a fuss, but it could have been awkward. Would recommend and would be happy to return here."
2111,KPD82,2013-08-31,5.0,"""EXCELLENT VALUE"" Stayed in the Hilton Gardens inn for 1 night for our Anniversary and what a pleasure it was and excellent value we paid £68 and that included breakfast and upon arrival we had complimentary drink vouchers gave us as it was a special occasion.
the room was small but very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Every room had an apple I mac in which was very handy there was also free wifi through out the hotel.
The buffet breakfast was good and there was plenty of choice.
If I had 1 criticism it was that the hotel charged £10 per night for parking which I found extortionate. 
But that aside i'll be sure to stay there again as it was a very pleasant stay."
2112,848MarkS848,2013-08-31,4.0,"Great Location in BS1, with parking Basic Hilton business-orientated hotel in the centre of Bristol.  Walking distance to all the main central areas.  Rooms are predictably quite small, but well appointed - with Apple IMACs, decent desk, good lighting and comfortable beds.  Staff were very helpful/professional.  Only complaint was that I was located near to one of the World's loudest Tumble Driers (I think that is what I was hearing all night!!) - so refuse Room 525 if offered it........  The hotel has a decent cafe on the Ground Floor (City Cafe) that serves decent food and drink and is comfortable."

Apple Macs in your room is a huge thumbs up and the bar and restaurant were very good... Can be expensive but it's a hotel and most are..
Staff friendly and helpful and breakfast was great"
2114,PeterS171,2013-08-31,4.0,"Clean, nice location, and helpful staff I have stayed in other hotels in Bristol, and this is definitely a good one. It is about 10 minute walk from the centre of town, but it is a pleasant walk. Internet is free and easy. It was also very good value. The rooms were very nice (not very big however) and modern and clean. Lots of electric plugs and beds were comfortable. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that there may be noise from road (if you have a room facing this), and severe shortage of parking out front (and tightness of space). Note that it has a restaurant / bar but that breakfast is not included in many packages."
2115,whitersmiles,2013-08-31,4.0,"Very good overnight stay Only spent one night but it was remarkably good. The room had a suprisingly ""expensive"" feel to it, and the breakfast was very satisfactory.

2116,Biddazzu,2013-08-31,4.0,"Good quality Hilton A very nice hotel that seems quite new and fresh. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. We booked a special deal and found too late it was for twin rooms but it was changed to a double no problem at all.

The only 2 points which dropped a star are a tiny bathroom, and TV over internet which was not fast enough to allow seamless watching. Personally I dislike Apple and found the iMac incredibly frustrating but I clearly realise that for this I'm in a minority.

However for the really important points - quiet room (even though we were on the road side of the hotel), cleanliness, bed and sleep quality, all were excellent so we can only recommend this hotel and would look forward to staying again."

2118,ch445,2013-07-31,5.0,"Modern, clean and comfortable I recently stayed in this hotel for a couple of weeks while working down in Bristol. 

The rooms were lovely and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and the shower was really good. All the rooms have iMac's  and there is free wi-fi throughout the hotel which is really useful. I also used the fitness room during the stay, which although was small, was perfectly adequate and there was always equipment free to use. Breakfast was really good in the mornings - they had so much selection! There is a waffle machine, cooked food like eggs, sausages, beans and bacon, and pastries, yoghurt and fruit as well. The atmosphere in the city cafe is also really lovely. 

The location is amazing - it's literally 5 minutes away from temple meads and cabot circus is about a 10 minute walk in the other direction. 

I'd definitely stay here again if I were to return to Bristol!"
2119,kgw555,2013-08-31,4.0,"How a hotel should be Lovely, clean, comphy, and tidy with a nice big bed. Staff at desk were freindly and polite very professional. Quick check in quick check out.

Only problem our flush was a little broken but as the rest of the room/hotel was good quality I assume this was work in progress. 

Ideal location, although on the main road, noise cannot be heard inside. 5 minute walk into city center, 5 minute walk to Harbourside. Just round the corner from Temple Meads Train station. 

This was exactly what I'd expect from a hotel, we had a pleasant stay and i would recommend this hotel to anyone. 

Breakfast was a bit pricey, £7 per person - and that was half price! 
Parking was supposed to be £10 for 24hours but they don't seem to have charged us for this - perhaps its free on weekends? 
Don't think there is anywhere nearby to park without paying."

We were on breakfast & evening meal arrangement, breakfast was good helpful & friendly staff had omelette every morning they were so good, evening meal was OK on 1st night & from then on got gradually worse took an age to get served on average it took over 2 hour's to complete a 3 course meal, on our last night took 1hour before we had our starter served & another 1 &1/2 hours before we had completed our meal, free drinks did not make up for this bad service, 
I am glad our coach only had 17 persons on if it had been full 50 persons I am sure there would have been a riot on our last night, We began to feel that we were being treated as 2nd class guest's because we had already paid for our stay in advance as other people came in to the restaurant & were served & away before we got our 1st course.

Negatives
- Insufficient parking lots

2127,OilRover,2013-08-31,5.0,"Easy walking distance from the station and the city center In a nutshell, I had a very happy experience at the Bristol Hilton Garden Inn when I stayed here during a recent business trip. I arrived by train from London and had an easy walk along the quayside to the hotel. I arrived at the hotel a little before 11:00 in the morning, and sheepishly asked if there was a room available so that I check in early and get a shower and some rest (I had flown into London from the USA that morning). There was a room, and the receptionist offered it to me with a big smile.

My room was at the back side of the hotel away from the main road, so it was nice and quiet. The room was well appointed, with all the main boxes checked for my ideal business hotel room (nice sized desk, flat-screen TV, iron and ironing board, and safety lock box). I did not have dinner in the hotel, but the breakfast buffet (well priced at just 7.50 pounds) was varied and generous, with an omelette station set up as well. The hotel has a small fitness room that opens at 6:00am, but get there one time if you want to guarantee a treadmill).

All in all this was a very good stay, and I appreciate the staff's extra effort to make my experience an enjoyable one. Well recommended. I would definitely stay here again next time I am in Bristol."

Location wise, it's a short walk into town or to Temple Meads station.

Staff were friendly, efficient and polite. The only negative was someone parking across the back of my car in a hatched area due to the lack of parking spaces. One 50 point turn later, I was able to leave. The barrier was up, which meant I was excused the £10 parking fee.

Having stayed at Hiltons before and found them good hotels we went with this which seemed a good location. The room was excellent and the Apple I Mac which doubled as a tv was a good bonus. The city centre and shopping area was only a short walk or quick bus ride away. Only wish we had found out about a huge wetherspoons and bar area hidden round the corner but discovered this on the last night. On the first day we had a snack in the hotel bar which at £5 for a cheese toastie was extortionate (Thats why I wish we had known about the wetherspoons!) The breakfast was very good with the waffle maker something different. The sausages had a strange taste though. All the staff were friendly and helpful. All in all a lovely hotel to stay in. Would stay there again.

The location (less than 10 minutes stroll from Temple Meads railway station, and from the habourside) is ideal, and the hotel is comfortable, and affordable too (if booked far enough in advance).

I have stayed at the hotel on many occasions, and based on my experiences this trip, the hotel seems to be doing a good job of maintaining standards of cleanliness and general upkeep. Bedding, towels and the overall comfort of the bedroom were good - and the iMac in the room offered a good selection of TV channels.

Just a few little details to attend to, and I'd give the hotel five stars!! The wi-fi (though free, and available throughout the hotel) was somewhat patchy in the bedroom. The fridge in the room, although switched on, didn't seem to be very cool. And, the reception staff need to learn how to smile!! At checkout in particular, the reception staff seemed to be rather surly and unwelcoming."

2141,harleyBoy42,2013-07-31,5.0,"Better than ever Haven't stayed here for more than a year, and wasn't sure what to expect after it changed to Hilton, but wow. Many of the team are still there who always made this hotel so special, and that's what makes a hotel for me. The people.

That said, the place is in great condition and very well looked after everywhere. Spotless and well maintained. 

However, the people will always be why I return to any hotel in the world, and a special mention for Shumi, the Housekeeper for her special touches to the room....thank you so much, it was like coming home. Also the reception team, when my partner arrived hours before me she had early access to the room & when I extended my stay nothing was a problem, the bar & restaurant team, good to catch up with you all. I should say here, I spent some time almost living there a couple of years ago and loved it.

I'll be back again....probably for the Harbour Festival next year!
Thanks"
2142,rachelsbuk,2013-07-31,5.0,"Comfortable stay in a great locatiom I booked one night here for a trip to Bristol as it was centrally-located and not too expensive. I loved my stay here; on my travels I usually stay in budget hotels or hostels so it was a real treat to stay somewhere so lovely! The bed was super-comfy - I had the best sleep I've had in ages - and the room was clean, spacious and air-conditioned. The free WiFi worked really well on my various devices which was handy, but there's an iMac TV if you don't have a device but want to go online. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious and set me up for the day. I'll definitely be looking to stay here next time I'm back. Thank you!"
2143,catp79,2012-08-31,5.0,"Hen/Stag Central!! I stayed here with a hen party back in July last year...the place was heaving with hen and stag do's so probably best to avoid if you're going for any other reason. 

 Check in was easy and the staff friendly. We had a twin room which was adequate in size and spotlessly clean. The bathroom is tiny though and the shower head fell off whilst my friend was in the shower. Luckily it didn't land on her! We called down to reception and when we got back from our night out it had been fixed. The bar is ok...good service but expensive (as all hotel bars are!). Breakfast was good and check out quick and easy.

A great place to stay and the staff were lovely!"

Apple Mac in each room, which acted as your TV was a really good touch.  The location is really good, close to the centre with a walk through a lovely little garden/park to get there.  Breakfast was really good and the staff were all really helpful and attentive.  Great hotel, and will definitely return to Bristol in the near future, lovely little city."

2146,81stephenw,2013-07-31,5.0,A great hotel I strongly recommend this hotel: conveniently situated just outside of the City centre and overlooks the ruins of Temple Church. The staff are amongst the friendliest I've ever come across who place guests comfort at the highest.

I agree with others that parking spaces were limited and we seemed to have be lucky to find a space.
I would go again."
2149,Julianfin,2013-07-31,4.0,Fine example of a Hilton Garden Inn We stayed for one night only but saw enough to be impressed. A few minutes walk to the city centre.

2151,babybun65,2013-07-31,2.0,"Drunken guests The hotel is well appointed and the majority of staff pleasant (Jayne in the breakfast room was the superstar for us) .

The location is good for accessing central Bristol attractions but parking is a complete lottery with inadequate spaces for the hotel size.

We stayed in Garden room 118 and while this was fairly compact it was comfortable as you would expect of the Hilton chain.

Unfortunately, and as you WOULD NOT EXPECT of the Hilton chain, our stay was marred by drunken stag guests banging on hotel room doors and swearing at 04:00 am. This was allowed to continue and was totally ignored by management (how such clearly inebriated individuals were allowed to enter the premises defeats me!)

Clearly hotel management cannot be responsible for 'guest' behaviour but they have obligations to ensure the safety and enjoyment of real guests.

So in summary, a pleasant enough hotel stay tarnished by apathetic security and management.

Sorry Mr Hilton you need to do much better than this, and we will not be back..."
2152,Kes_Jules_Jaik_Leo,2013-07-31,5.0,"ALMOST FAULTLESS Great welcome and quick check-in.

Room was modest size but well appointed - pretty clean and very comfortable bed.

iMac was a TV with free internet browsing, as well as free wifi throughout.

I stayed during the heatwave - the air con struggled to cool the room and was a bit noisy - this is about my only negative.

Modern throughout. The restaurant served great evening food (hotel prices) as well as the buffet breakfast. If the weather is good ask to sit on the veranda - you can watch the world go by...

Overall a pretty good experience, considering its a budget/baby Hilton."
2153,MS801,2013-06-30,4.0,"Great for business I travelled to this hotel alone as I was on business. The location of the hotel is great. A short walk from the town centre. A Tesco express is very nearby which is great for snacks, magazines etc. A small park is located outside the hotel and provided a nice view from my window. 

The bedroom itself was great. An Apple Mac computer served as both a computer and a TV and I found this excellent for doing some work, browsing the internet and watching TV.
The room seemed very new and modern and I can't fault the decor. 
Tea and coffee making facilities, a mini fridge (empty so you can fill it with your own drinks and snacks), and an iron meant I had all the essentials for  comfortable stay. 
The only fault I will say was that the air conditioning was very poor and the room was on one night almost unbearably warm. The window only opens a couple of inches (great for security reasons) meaning there wasn't much of a breeze that could come in. 

The staff were very friendly and welcoming and I found dining in the hotel to be a great experience. 

Breakfast had all the usual food items (fruits, cereals,cheese, meat, juices, tea and coffee bread for toasting, hot buffet) as well as a great addition of a waffle iron! You were able to make yourself a fresh waffle by pouring the batter on the iron. A great and tasty idea.

I ate dinner on two occasions and was pleased with the standard of food. A small menu but I believe there is something to suit most tastes. Great portion sizes and cooked to a high quality. 

From what I saw of the rest of the hotel, it all seemed very clean and well maintained with modern decor. 

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Bristol and indeed if I am travelling to Bristol again in future I will book this hotel."

Everything you need in one place."
2157,Shiraz64,2013-07-31,4.0,"Comfortable stay, breakfast could have been better! We stayed here for on a Friday night.  We arrived on a hot summers afternoon.  Check in was efficient, and we asked for an upgrade and were given a quiet room on the upper floors overlooking the park.  The room wasnt big, but OK for our purposes.  Bathroom was small, but had good powerful shower.  The bed was comfortable.  Location is good.

The only gripes I would have was the air conditioning was ineffective, despite putting it on manual controls, the room was still uncomfortable.  I did ask for a fan, which was sent to my room.

Breakfast was not so good.  We have stayed at the HIlton Garden chain before in Aberdeen and were very impressed.  This hotel was disappointing.  There was nobody in situ to fry eggs.  The bacon had a grey tinge to it and looked like it had been boiled or steamed rather than fried.  Sausages were salty and lacking flavour tea came in a mug with teabag rather than a teapot.

I would stay here again for the location, but would hope that the aircon and breakfast could be improved."
2158,mridsdill,2013-07-31,5.0,"Brilliant 6 mins from the city centre, great base for exploring.  Rooms exceptional including air con in this current heat.  Apple Mac in each room.

2159,AmberQ,2013-07-31,5.0,"Excellent hotel We stayed here last weekend with their get away deal, which included dinner and breakfast. The hotel is well situated for the city and Bristol Temple Meads, and is clean and modern. The room was lovely, again, clean and modern with an iMac and very comfy bed. The dinner menu was a little limited, but the breakfast was outstanding! Usual full English and pastries available but also waffles, which made my Sunday morning! The staff were attentive and friendly - I often find the staff let down otherwise good hotels, but this certainly wasn't the case here, all the staff we came into contact with were helpful and super smiley! 

The only small negative was that the room was rather warm, the air con didn't seem to do much, but to be fair it was an insanely hot weekend (not normal for the UK!). 

I'd definitely come back here again, particularly with a similar special offer."
2160,Addickted12157,2013-07-31,4.0,"Boutique-y hotel, without paying boutique hotel prices We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights while on the hunt for Gromit (the art festival which has taken the city by storm) and were pleasantly surprised.

The room was clean and tidy with everything we needed and a few extras. Whether or not they were intended for our consumption, the fridge (very welcome during our stay as it was during the extended warm period) came equipped with 2 yoghurts and a double choc muffin, which we decided best not to eat, just in case.

We had booked through a third party for a Queen Evolution Room, but on check in were allocated a twin room. I wasn't too fussed, but my other half was not so happy. Perhaps the guy who checked us in thought the booking was a mistake, but 2 gay guys can share a bed, can't they?

The hotel is conveniently located a short stroll from Templemeads Station and from the city centre.

The I Mac in the room was a nice touch, even though the lag on the tv was a bit annoying at times, once you found how to turn the thing on. A handily placed instruction leaflet near the button outfoxed my other half (an Apple virgin) but still, it was a nice thing to have in the room.

The Pantry downstairs was a nice idea, although the prices were a bit steep.

Despite being located right next to a main road, there was no noise from the outside with the windows closed and the other residents seemed to be considerate.

All in all, a nice hotel and I would choose this brand of hotel next time and certainly this hotel if I ever have the pleasure of visiting the beautiful city again."
2161,bnctindal,2013-06-30,5.0,"Great hotel, staff cant do enough for you My husband had stayed here on business and raved about this hotel, so next time I went with him and I wasn't disappointed. 
Location was great for the city centre, rooms are perfect plenty of space to hang things up, drawers to put things away, this is lacking in a lot of hotels but not the hilton. Apple Mac in every room, complimentary water in the fridge which was a blessing.
My husband left some items of clothing and they traced them and returned them to us, which we are very greatful for.
Only downside is we won't be back this year but hopefully planning a non-business break for next year.
If you're are looking for a hotel in Bristol, you cant go wrong with the Bristol Hilton Garden Inn"
2162,ChrisR89,2013-07-31,5.0,Brilliant We stayed at the hotel over on a little trip from Dublin. Our flight was very early into Bristol and chanced our arm at checking in early where we were met by Alice on reception. A very generous welcome was extended from her and we even got the early check in with no hassle. The hotel is very well situated in Bristol and the view of the park is very nice! The rooms are lovely the addition of the Imac is brilliant! When we went for food in the evening it was very tasty and fresh. Breakfast at the hotel again as expected fantastic! Wide selection and all available. The HGI waffle was very tasty! When checking out after getting a slightly later departure we were once again speaking with Alice and was only too courteous a true credit to the hotel! Overall will be back and the hotel a huge deciding factor in this is down to the brilliant staffing body they have in place there!!!!
2163,gianfrancog25,2013-07-31,5.0,"Great stay, limited dinner menu The hotel itself was fanctastic. Clean, modern facilities and the Imac in the room with free internet was great. The bathroom came fully stocked and there was a kettle with the bits for tea and coffee as expected.   Whilst the food was very good, the menu was very limited (only three items as mains) on the promotional code that we used.  Other than the limited food though, great hotel, friendly and helpful staff and would certainly go again."
2164,annelouisep,2013-06-30,4.0,"A pleasant stay This hotel was well appointed, clean,comfortable and the staff were helpful and welcoming   What more could you want! We booked a deal which included an evening meal which was good to come back to at the end of a busy day. The only complaint is that the communication between front desk and the restaurant could have been better. The restaurant were not sure what the deal covered and there was considerable confusion about which of two different menus we should be offered( they gave us both at different points in the meal) they offered us wine with the deal and then retracted the offer. The meal ended with us being issued a hefty bill for the meal which I refused to sign! They said it would all be sorted by checkout in the morning and it was. I did though pass a bit of a restless night worrying about the possible confrontation in the morning. Overall though it was a good stay."
2165,BoltonMonkeyfish,2013-05-31,4.0,"Will stay again I really like this hotel. The concept is boutique ( ish) without the price tag. They have pantry area in reception for you to buy items to stock your fridge if you wish and also meals (frozen) to cook in a microwave if you wanted to, its alll designed discreetly and doesn't look at all tacky.
They almost always have home made biscuits too on reception for you to take away and try, a nice touch. Rooms are nice and clean, an apple mac TV and docking station with remote.Powerful showers and nice toiletries. Food is OK, though I usually have room service, and there isn't a massive choice but it's fine. I go on business but it feels like a holiday I enjoy my stay so much."

We paid extra for a park view room which was a good size. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning was a good send during the heat wave. It was great having a fridge in the room too.

We were lucky that we got the last parking space in front of the hotel, but there is a car park just behind the hotel next to the park. Breakfast was excellent. Again the staff were friendly and hard working. My husband ordered 2 fried eggs which were cooked freshly for him and arrived promptly. There was plenty of seating and outdoor tables which was good given the weather. Breakfast was served upto 12pm which again was excellent. The drinks in the bar were reasonably priced for a hotel.

I would definitely stay at this hotel again."

2170,MissJasmine,2013-07-31,4.0,"Nice City Break REVIEW – HILTON GARDEN INN, BRISTOL STAYED 12th July 2013
We booked this hotel for one night on Friday 12th July for a short city break. We arrived at 12:15pm and managed to find a parking space in the hotel car park. It looks like they do not have an awful lot of spaces and I am sure if the hotel is full, you may not get a space. The spaces themselves are quite tight and I was glad that our car had the bumper beepers to stop us scratching the car. Car Parking for residents was £10 for 24 hours.
When I enquired at check-in if a room was available, bearing in mind we were about 3 hours early, Kayleigh at the desk checked and yes, a room was available on the first floor. The rooms themselves are quite compact more like a studio style with just a shower, no bath, a small desk with an apple I-Mac which doubled as the TV. The window only opened about 2 inches and the air conditioning was a bit weak, so the room did seem hot, but temperatures outside were upto 30 degrees.
Nice toiletries, very clean room, fridge (empty) safe and free wi-fi. I went on the hunt for some Ice and found David in the bar area who went above and beyond in assisting me, even taking time to obtain a map and explain the sights and attractions within walking distance of the hotel. We decided to take a walk and found that shops, bars and restaurants are in easy walking distance of the hotel, after some shopping and an early dinner, we returned to the hotel for a few drinks in the bar. We were served by Hubert, a very nice guy from Poland, who looked after our drinks requirements.
We retired about 10pm and had a somewhat restless night due to the heat and the weak air con, however when we did get up, we were very impressed by the breakfast and the standard choices were there in a buffet format. 
When we checked out, we realised that we had a ‘wine and dine’ package, a fact we had totally forgotten, however the receptionist who handled our check out, took the £10 car parking charge off the bill and gave us a nice bottle of Pinot to take home, free of charge.
Overall a smart, pleasant, boutique style hotel, very central with very friendly and helpful staff, I would recommend this hotel for a short city break although arrive early to get a parking space"

I ordered a twin bedroom (for size) and when asked if it was only for me - was downgraded to a single - note to self - say other half is just fetching the bags in. For a Hilton - place is starting to get worn. Room - fairly tidy - but small. Bathroom - small, glad I didn't take the cat. The iMac. Great, been on them since they have been in UK. Mouse cable frayed and so didn't work - was I bothered - not really - just watched TV. Noisy AC but efficient.

2173,cellrone,2013-06-30,3.0,"Clean rooms, inconsistent staff I had a four day stay here, a bit of work and a bit of seeing Bristol for the first time.
The rooms are bright and clean with free wifi and a good desk space for working with a free newspaper in the morning.
Although a lot of the staff were polite, even I was more friendly than the manager. 
She seemed disinterested and rude even as I checked out. I didn't have breakfast included, but she did tell me if I told her a day in advance she could add it to my booking for less than adding it in the morning.
I would point out it's a 10minute walk into town through a small street out the back -Church st to Victoria Street, which can seem a bit desolate at night when you're a woman on your own, I opted for room service for two of the nights which was good food.
Still the station is just around the corner and the bus to Clifton- where I needed to travel to was right outside the hotel. As I left I saw a Seagull tucking into a Pigeon in the parking lot... nice."

On arrival it was clear there are a lot of business folk with the amount of briefcases,newspapers and suits! But that didn't bother us in our summer clothes and flip flops we were still made to feel welcome!The facilities looked good even though we didn't really use  them they looked very helpful including a 24 hr pantry where you can purchase anything from a snack to a microwave meal! We were offered a morning paper and a wake up call which we didn't need but was nice to be offered! The room was very clean and at the right temperature for this weather! The room included a fridge,ice bucket,hair dryer (thank god),clock radio,iron,ironing board,air con and an I-MAC which just reminded us we have spoilt ourselves a bit staying at this hotel! So not only could you watch tv, you could also watch a dvd,surf the net,play games,listen to music via iTunes and much more! Also there is free wifi connection in the hotel and you dont need to sign up or log on it connects automatically!
The bed was quite hard and the pillows were soft which was ok for me but my partner didn't sleep well at all and this was the only let down! I do feel however if we had asked for not so soft pillows I feel we probably would have got them!
Breakfast was lush! Very fresh both cooked and continental buffet style! There was also a menu made fresh to order including smoked salmon and waffles!
Overall we had a great stay and felt welcome! 

Its a shame my partner didn't sleep so well!"
2175,RebeccaT800,2013-07-31,4.0,"Fantastic location Great location, with plenty of restaurants / bars on the doorstep. The hotel was very busy, but the staff were helpful and quite capable of dealing with a large volume of people.

We used a meeting room on the first day, which had everything we needed, with refreshments toppped up throughout the day. We were also asked to pre-order lunch in the restaurant, which saved hanging around.

My room was nicely decorated, and felt quite new. The bathroom was small, but well designed, with a clever shower door. The bed was comfortable, and I had a very good night's sleep. There was an iMac in the room, which doubled up as a tv, which was a nice touch.

There was also free WiFi - well done Hilton!

The car park is very small and cramped, and can't be pre-booked. Temple Meads train station is nearby, so presumably most people arrive by train."

We ate in the restaurant on the first night we stayed and the food was amazing. We were pleasantly surprised as to just how good the food was. The staff were very friendly polite and helpful.

2182,The_loyal_traveller,2013-04-30,4.0,"Good but not great The main selling point must be the proximity to temple meads station and being the only hilton in town it attracts a lot of Hilton Honors guests. Other than the station I find the hotel someone lost and stranded halfway between town and the cabot circus area which are each a 10min walk away. 

Rooms are standard for HGI: very small and more basic than Hilton hotels but with just about everything you need. I personally don't like the iMac TV setup as the screen is small and the remote control is quite limiting but I know others love it. Adjustable air conditioning is great and a must in summer.

Breakfast has all the usual hot and cold food offerings. Food in the restaurant is of a high standard and comes highly recommended amongst a number of cab drivers and locals to Bristol. This is fortunate as there aren't many restaurants near the hotel."
2183,Tappy19,2013-06-30,3.0,"a slight disappointment When I booked this with central bookings I was assured there would be a bath and there wasn't. The room was very small and the bed was a double with a double duvet which didn't allow for some overhang. There is limited car parking space although we were fortunate. Once we parked we didn't move it for the two nights we were there. The biggest moan was the breakfast. Always only warm or near cold and sausages both days were severely undercooked. No reliable  ''egg'' person on duty. The tables NEVER set properly so I was up and down either asking for waitress help or grabbing from other tables.
W e had just spent two nights at a hotel in Bath serving a disastrous breakfast and we fell foul again!!"
2184,Royal-with-Cheese,2013-06-30,4.0,"Enjoyable stay Nice clean modern hotel. polite and efficient staff in a good location all be it on a very busy main room. Loved the iMAC's in the rooms and breakfast until midday. Bar had a great atmosphere and reasonable prices.  Couldn't understand the huge queues at the breakfast buffet until I came across the strangely situated egg station at the end holding everybody up, it needs to be positioned better to smooth out breakfast. Staff not as pleasant on check out as check in. Overall a decent stay."
2185,T0rdE,2013-06-30,3.0,"Basic, plain, with no frills Stayed here during a business trip because of it's location, which if fine, but not much more. For a hotel chain that promotes itself as a business person's choice I was surprised to be be greeted with ""sorry the car park is full, but you can park across the street"" (in an unlit public parking lot). Which meant that the car had to be emptied which was inconvenient. I was also told that if I could move my car to the hotel parking lot before 8 the following morning, I wouldn't have to pay anything across the street. Fine, the problem was that at 8 in the morning the hotel parking was still full. And continued to be so until I checked out. 
The room was nice even though too spacious, which made me wonder what there was both a chair and an armchair in it?
The bathroom was (no kidding) 1.5 x 1.5 meters (5 x 5 feet) and in that space there were two doors that needed space to be opened. It resembled a restroom on an aeroplane.
The bed was firm, which was probably the best part part of the stay. (besides the iMac/TV which was nice combination. Now all you need to do is hook it up to a printer too)
The noisy aircond was a nuisance, that made me shut it off and sleep with the window open instead.
Checking out was a hassle and extra delayed because the elevator was stuck on the third floor, and the bags had to be carried down from the third floor. The breakfast staff did it's best to spread joy, but why did I have to order a boiled egg? Isn't this something that can be ready? The extensive selection of cereals seems important to the hotel, but why only offer a single cheese selection (in thick slices) on your breakfast buffé?
So this Hilton Garden only gets an OK. No more and no less."
2186,Ullans,2013-06-30,4.0,"Business stay I stay here regularly on business and it is one of the nicer hotels in Bristol.  The rooms are a little small, but in the side of the hotel one is rewarded with nice views over Temple Gardens and they are very quiet.  The staff are friendly and professional.  The breakfast is good.  Recommended."
2187,danielled185,2013-06-30,5.0,"Wonderful Stay Great location, right by the train station, very clean hotel, very helpful staff, lovely room with lots of great facilities. The shower was brilliant! The bed was lovely and breakfast was delicious and fresh. Would definitely stay again, could not fault them."
2188,99gillh,2013-06-30,5.0,"Weekend Break in Bristol We enjoyed our stay here.  The room was on the small side compared with other Hiltons we have stayed in, but had a nice outlook to the park opposite.  Very quiet room and of good appearance. I had problems with the Apple equipment in the room, but that was soon sorted by the front desk.   The beds were on the firm side, but comfortable. Good position for walking the sites in Bristol."

2191,ThePennells,2013-06-30,5.0,Great value modern and clean Paid £100 bed breakfast and two course evening meal. Food better than expected and rooms modern and very clean. Friendly staff and great value. Hotel close to main railway station and most shops and attractions yet far enough away from nightlife not to be woken in early hours on a weekend stay.!
2192,katieh890,2013-06-30,5.0,"Very good The location is convenient rather than picturesque, near Temple Meads station and with a bus stop right outside that takes you to Clifton and the zoo via the city centre.  

Comfortable modern rooms, very pleasant staff and a terrace at the back opposite a small park, (with blankets provided for the British summer). 

Good value for money.  I would definitely stay here again."
2193,314JamesD,2013-06-30,5.0,A Great Experience Customer service at this hotel was excellent and really made me feel welcome and the cookie offered on check in was a nice touch. The bar staff and restaurant staff made you feel at home. I would stay here again.
2194,insulaner1984,2013-06-30,4.0,"Surprised, pretty good hotel Stayed for one night during the week, generally very happy with stay and quality of room and breakfast. Found there to be a fair amount of noise from the corridor and from above unfortunately, other than that pretty good."
2195,David_P186220,2013-06-30,4.0,"Lovely food, good value, great staff A really well designed hotel, 5 mins walk from Temple Meads with a great restaurant at the back overlooking a tranquil green space, this is one 
of Bristol's great surprises. Inventive menu, simple well chosen wine list, great bar snacks, and delightful staff. This is a hotel that is well led, with a great team and it shows."
2196,R1200R_08,2013-06-30,5.0,"Three Stays and Still Excellent My wife and I were visiting Bristol for three days relaxation and to catch up with some old friends, and, having stayed here twice before, we chose to book in again in the hope that the previous good experiences would continue. We knew the standard room is ok for size, the breakfast choice extensive and it's location perfect as a base from which to conduct a walking tour of the city centre area and its attractions.

This time we had dinner in the restaurant - it was a superb evening from the moment we were greeted in the bar and the first conversations on drinks and menu selection.

Of particular note is the consistently high standard of conduct we've observed among all the staff with whom we've had contact. Welcoming, courteous and responsive to our requests are just some of their strong points and this has been our experience on all our stays. Three good visits merits a mention on Tripadvisor - well done, Hilton."
2197,4LindaH,2013-06-30,5.0,"Great Stay We had a team night work and stayed here, eight of us in total. It was perfect for a Friday night, close to the centre and nice restaurants. Staff were lively, especially Jane at breakfast, her manner was so friendly first thing in the morning! Staying in hotels is part of my job, and it was definitely one of the best breakfasts I have had:-)"
2198,KeithEsther,2013-06-30,4.0,"business trip I spent 2 nights in the Hilton Garden City Bristol formerly called the Mint, staff were good very helpful the rooms are of standard size breakfast was serve yourself all in all a pleasant experience
the hotel is situated right next to Bristol Temple meads which is ideal if you are travelling by train."
2199,mm33741,2013-06-30,3.0,"Good for midgets My wife and I booked a queen evolution room and to say it was claustrophobic would be generous. Not sure you could even turn around in the bathroom (bath cupboard). I wouldn't have been happy with single occupancy let alone for two. Very disappointing for the money. The imac was a good idea and breakfast was good but the room was poor. To cap it all they charged us £10 a day to park our car in the car park (only told us this at the end). The staff were mostly indifferent, they didn't ask us whether we had enjoyed our stay when we left just took the money.
First and last time I'll stay there!"
2200,OliviaRR,2012-08-31,4.0,"Great IF you are looking good located hotel, with very clean and tidy rooms- THis is place where you should go. Great Staff- very friendly- which is the most important for me always. 

But what else to expect from Hilton?

The only problem is with busy roads... bit noisy."
2201,ElectricBeige,2013-06-30,3.0,"Underwhelmed by serive... Whilst it carries the Hilton name, I felt that the hotel fell below the standards I expected. The room was pleasant, albiet fairly small and the reception staff were quite helpful. The food though, was not up to scratch; from the service (by whom I assume was the FOH manager to the food itself. The onion rings 'oozed' oil, leaving me feeling quite ill after eating one. 

Not an unpleasant stay, but I'd sooner have opted for the considerably cheaper Premier Inn."
2202,Tiptoptraveller,2013-06-30,3.0,"Well located but facing a busy road. Good location a few minutes walk from Temple Meads station and about the same distance to the harbour and the old city or to the Old Market area and Cabot Circle, a stylish new shopping centre. Not far to walk to local restaurants. However, the downside is that the hotel faces a very busy main road (Temple Way). Rooms on the back face Temple Church Garden, which is very pleasant and quiet, although you can still hear traffic at the front during the day (with the window open). I don't think I would want to stay at the front. First impression is that the interior is bit clinical and that the reception area is uninviting. Modestly sized rooms have similar furnishings to a Doubletree with comfortable bed and pillows with a lightweight duvet. The bathroom is small (shower only). Tea and coffee making facilities, ironing board and small fridge. Good breakfast with freshly cooked eggs and waffles, though tea and coffee were a bit hard to come by on one of the days. Good free wi-fi and an Apple TV/computer. Overall good value."
2203,kcm1951,2013-06-30,4.0,"Almost Excellent We spent 3 nights here for a long weekend, partly pleasure and partly while I was on a one-day conference.  Standard double room was good, if a little small -- the shower-room was definitely tiny and wedged in a corner, but perfectly acceptable.  Comfortable bed.  Adjustable air conditioning.  Apple iMac in the room doubled as computer and TV was appreciated as was free wifi.  Self-service breakfast (included in our package) was excellent with wide choice of options; good bacon and super herby sausages.  Bar and restaurant menu was rather more limited than expected -- it looked more like many hotels' room service menu.  Having said that the fish & chips was good cod (not like many who serve who knows what fish these days) and the burgers were also good; onion rings probably the best I've ever had.  Range of draught beer also very disappointing.  Staff always friendly and helpful; you did get the feeling nothing would be too much trouble.  Beware the rather ferocious lift doors!  Would have liked a swimming pool, but I knew when booking there wasn't one.  Close to Temple Meads Station an advantage for train traveller, though it is a nasty 5 minute walk across a manic roundabout.  Fix the restaurant menu, the beer and the swimming pool and this would be outstanding."
2204,464nathanb,2013-06-30,4.0,"Annie is a babe. On arrival we discovered that the Hilton needs a bigger car park, although it is possible to park on the yellow box area so this wasnt a problem.
We checked in(10 minutes early!) and went up to the room which was clean, spacious, bright and well equipped(apple computer/tv, 'fridge', hair dryer, safe, lovely shower).
The fridge wasnt actually a fridge hense the inverted commas although when we asked about this at reception we were told it used to be a mini bar and isnt actually a working fridge, more of a cooler, so bear this in mind if like us you want a bottle of wine make sure you buy one in bristol already chilled.
We forgot toothpaste, which was available to buy from reception which was helpful, there was also a selection of snacks and various beverages.

We only stayed for one night but the staff were helpful, we only came in contact with the receptionists as we didnt use the cafe etc. but they were all very helpful, especially Annie the supervisor. She took time to draw directions on maps, print maps, explain to us the quickest routes, recommending places that were nice to visit(Bath) and then even after our first night ask us the next day if we had a nice night the night before for which she'd given us directions to the harbour. She provided excellent personal service and was a lovely woman, an excellent ambassador for the hotel and hilton group.

As I said we only stayed for one night and it was really just a bed for the night as we didnt spend much time in the hotel but wanted to explore bristol and the surrounding areas, but the room and hotel in general were excellent and friendly customer service made it better."
2205,Prof-de-langues,2013-06-30,4.0,"Very helpful staff Just a quick overnight stay on business but very impressed by staff attitude.  On arrival reception gave me a token for a free drink having overheard my travel difficulties.  I booked a taxi for the next morning.  When it was late, the reception repeatedly chased it for me and did all they could to make amends, even though it was not their fault.  My room was fine for a one night stay.  I liked the iMac computer and television.  The bed was comfortable for me - might be a bit too firm for some.  Bathroom very clean and perfectly adequate.  I heard some complaints that breakfast was disappointing but I had only a cup of coffee (good) and a bowl of cereal, so can't comment first hand."
2206,MarkH454545,2013-06-30,5.0,"Modern and gleaming My short review is that this is a very nice hotel, located close to the railway station, and with lovely helpful staff.

It took a short walk from Bristol Temple Mead railway station, but I should have called the hotel in advance for directions.

I passed through a very pleasant brick office area on my way there, which perhaps was rebuilt from scratch about 10 years ago. I checked in early, was immediately given a room, and then found my room to be very modern and gleaming, with new blond wood and an iMAC combination computer-tv.

Throughout my two day stay the reception staff was exceptionally pleasant and helpful in a several different ways. Wifi is free. 

It was a three minute short across the River Severn to the centre city and market."
2207,jimmyD23,2013-03-31,4.0,"Great hotel stayed here for my stag doo. I was alittle dubious when the stag company said we were staying in a hilton hotel for a stag doo thats pretty high standards for a couple of nights. There was 18of us who stayed for two nights and from the moment we arrived to when we left we were made very welcome by all staff. The rooms were very clean n nice showers were very gd n beds nice n comfy. 
Had other stag doo's staying at same time and people on a weekend break too which all seemed fine even when I was made to dress up for the two days staff and other guest had no problem at all. 
Staff were even very accommodating when we were coming back at 4am from a night out making us coffee n drinks whilst we ate takeout in the bar area. 
The breakfast food was very good and there was a large variety of full English, continental, waffles, fruit and cereal was something for every one.
All in all this is a nice hotel which I would def come back to again with my wife as it is in a great location for getting in Bristol city centre and exploring the area."
2208,PatDub,2013-06-30,3.0,"Weekend Break Booked into this hotel for a Saturday & Sunday Night.  The Hotel is full of stags & hens Parties On the Saturday so is a bit noisy.  The Room is Very small in fact one of the smallest room I have ever stayed in and the bathroom is small beyond belief.  As the weather was nice at the weekend the room was very warm even with the aircon on.  Breakfast however was very good with full english breakfast, cerals, fruit and a do it yourself waffle maker that was a bit messy.  the Location is very good about 10 walk to the hippodrome and city centre."
2209,MrsP48,2013-05-31,5.0,"Spotless, well designed rooms & lovely staff. There are a bewildering number of pricing options available within the Hilton group, which seem to vary from hotel to hotel. We were staying for 2 nights and eventually opted for the 'Room, Wine & Dine' offer, which included a 3 course dinner + a bottle of wine the first evening, together with half price breakfast on both mornings. We weren't disappointed. The hotel was spotlessly clean - on both days we saw members of staff cleaning & touching up paintwork scuffs on several floors. After reading a review regarding possible road noise, we paid an extra fiver for a room overlooking the small park at the rear of the hotel, away from the main road & heard no noise at all, perfect! Rooms were well designed, with thoughtful touches like hinged mirror panels on the wall - useful to see the back of your head when drying hair; there was also a magnifying mirror in the well-lit bathroom - good to see the female traveller being catered for! An iMac was a great addition & there was also a lockable small fridge. 
City Café, the hotel restaurant & bar, was excellent - I'm not usually a fan of buffet style breakfasts, but there was plenty of choice available and the hot food was all freshly cooked. There was also a varied choice on the evening dinner menu. Our meals were all delicious. The only negative point was the dreadful coffee offered at breakfast - the waitress agreed it was disgusting & offered to make a fresh coffee from the bar, which was lovely. 
The staff really do set the standard for customer service here - everyone was friendly & professional. The lovely Bristolian lady cooking eggs at breakfast deserves a special mention for the smiley welcome she gave everyone. We would certainly stay here again."
2210,wmds,2013-05-31,4.0,"Higly recommended. It was very convenient. Service was excellent.  Rooms were immaculate with a flat TV screen with internet. Buffet breakfast was superb.  Not gone over the top. Service was very quick, considering the number of guests. Every item needed in a hotel room was provided. We had two double rooms between 3 adults.Was easy to get to bath and costwold. Easy access to other popular eating places especially cosmo.
We had a welcome  tray of brownies and cookies (good gesture, of course not champagne)
It was real value for money.  After the bank holiday it would have been 50%off). We booked via expedia.Suggestion:1. Rooms could have been a bit more spacious. 
2. When a single person occupies a double room and pay the same amount, the buffet b'fast charge for one must be taken off. 3. More parking for guests, as at times we had to reverse with difficulty to find a parking place away from the hotel. We were lucky to get a place nearby."
2211,j0sephk,2013-06-30,5.0,never fails to impress this is not the first time we have used the Hilton Garden chain and will be using it again the Bristol hotel was very clean and the food was excellent on the first night we wre there i ordered a drink in the bar the waiter said they had just ran out of that drink but if i waited a few mins they would see what they could do the waiter then ran to the local off licence and bought a bottle and i was served with a smile many thanks for going the extra mile
2212,Ghillie34,2013-06-30,5.0,Lovely time We only stayed the 1 night but everything was 1st class from easy checking in to checking out the next day.Staff were very friendly &smiley.No noise just a relaxing place to stay.On the breakfast front it was great but really could do with hash browns as being veggies egg/beans is a little boring..Defo stay again!!
2213,leonk394,2013-05-31,5.0,"Had everything we needed. We were in Bristol for a music festival and the hotel was perfect for everything we needed. Easy to get to, parking on site and only 5mins walk to venue and city center. Hotel was nice and clean, as was room. Breakfast was good,cooked eggs made in front of you rather than being sat under the light for hours and plenty of choice even waffles and muffins for those with a sweeter tooth. Apart from one personal gripe the overall experience was excellent, we would definitely return next year."

very helpful staff
comfortable room with good quality facilities and toiletries
free imac and wifi (great concept that other establishments would do well to follow)
big choice for breakfast
good location, 10 mins or so to harbourside
good value
we will stay again, thanks"
2215,DavidC966,2013-05-31,4.0,"Clean and Comfortable The Hilton Garden Inn in Bristol says that it is Centre City, but without a car it seems a bit far from the center of town.  The address, Temple Way doesn't really tell you where it is as Temple Way is a bit of a stretch, there is no number on the building, so my walk from the Central Bus station, with luggage, was about 20-25 minutes.  The room was extremely well appointed and clean and the service was quite good, so it well enough made up for the distance I had to walk.  But if you are in town to enjoy the city, the nightlife, and the urban feel, this might be slightly off the beaten path.  But overall it was a lovely place, clean, quite and well managed."
2216,ScottD283,2013-05-31,5.0,"Great Staff Stayed here for 2 nights on good value dinner and breakfast deal. The rooms are very clean and the iMac a great feature. The thing that sets this hotel apart from others we have stayed in is the fantastic staff. I mentioned in passing when i booked that the visit was for our anniversary and this had been noted and when we were served our deserts they had piped Happy Anniversary around both plates. This was typical of the personal touch you got from all the staff we met, always happy to help. To make this a balanced review I have to mention a couple of negatives. Firstly the set dinner menu main courses of which there were only 3 was the same both nights we stayed and with one being a vegetarian choice left us feeling that the menu was a tad lazy, especially given that there were many dishes on the main restaurant menu being served. The other negative could be the parking. We were fortunate enough to get a space but had we not would have faced driving elsewhere and walking back which is not ideal after travelling.  Otherwise a great hotel in a great location with fantastic staff. We would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone."
2217,ToniW147,2013-05-31,5.0,"Fab bank holiday What an amazing place to stay, clean, friendly, very helpful, Apple Mac in bedroom, awesome, bathroom a little small but clean, would recommend this hotel, we had three course evening meal with a bottle of wine, couldn't fault it at all, really recomend breakfast everything you could possibly want........ Thanks Hilton for out fab stay......."
2218,iRyan81,2013-05-31,3.0,"Sort out the room service This is the third time I've stayed in this hotel but the first time since it became part of the Hilton Garden Inn chain (was previously a City Inn and then Mint Hotel). The hotel itself is fine and the rooms are well appointed, however, the room seemed to be a lot smaller than before.

The two issues I had were firstly with the carpark, I've never seen such narrow spaces and to try and cram even more cars in the staff were allowing people to park in the yellow hatched area making getting out even harder. On my second night I couldn't get back in the carpark so had to park around the corner and then get up before 8am to move.

The second issue is with room service and it only being available between 5pm-10pm. Outside of those hours the only option is to go down to the rather naff 'Pavillion' where there is a selection of snacks and microwave meals available. I really don't know why room service isn't available throughout the day if not later at night and whilst it didn't matter to me it didn't even seem like breakfast in your room was a possibility."
2219,NZTraveller66,2013-05-31,4.0,"Good value for money We stayed at the hotel for only one night but enjoyed the stay and felt that we got value for money.  We had a standard double room and it was clean and tidy as expected. The room was spacious and had the Apple imac tv.  The bathroom was small but spotless and the bathroom products were really good.  It was also a pleasant surprise to find an iron and ironing board in the room!

Check-in was efficient and although our room wasn't ready (we got there early), staff were happy to hold on to our bags and give us any help we needed in finding our way around Bristol.

Breakfast was included in the room rate and there was a reasonable selection available.  The hot food was fresh - it didn't feel like it had been sitting around for ages, with eggs on demand.  The hotel also has a pantry in the reception area which is handy for buying snacks and drinks at all hours (there is no stocked mini-bar in the rooms).

All in all, a comfortable nights sleep in a very conveniently located hotel.  We would stay again."
2220,ZhikunW1,2013-05-31,5.0,overall: one of the best to stay in Bristol Very good atmosphere and services. Rooms very clean and comfortable. Only one small problem is the fire alarm test runs every Monday morning. It will be much better if there could be changed to afternoons.
2221,mairi_ok,2013-05-31,5.0,"Home from home We returned to this great hotel with my 92 year old mother,we stayed three nights. Again a most enjoyable experience,my mother had a lovely time.the staff are consistently considerate and kind- really good recruitment process! We had an issue with the safe and telephone not working,within minutes maintenance had it sorted and we were given a miniature replica toolkit with hammer shaped mints in it. A nice touch.
We do not have breakfast as we don't eat much in the morning but there are some nice small cafes in the street behind, through the park,Victoria st. There is also a Tesco express for bits and pieces for the fridge. It is also where you can pick up the open top bus at Novotel.At the top of this street there is a really nice restaurant The Glass Boat on the river.
We have recommended this hotel to lots of people due to the staff, cleanliness, relaxed comfort ,location and the price. A gem!"

2224,DavidS18230,2013-05-31,5.0,great hotel!!! stayed at garden inn Bristol and found the hotel to be in a perfect location where i was two min from city center by taxi and somewhere tranquil at nites end. rooms and facilities first class and exemplary service! highly recommended
2225,Maggie577,2013-05-31,3.0,"Hmmm not so good as expecting..... Arrived to be given keys to a generous pleasant sized room and very happy until going to the bar to have an evening drink after a beer for thirst we asked for a glass of sauvignon Blanc to be told that they had non in stock until the next order, hmmm ok a chardonney then please to be given the last of a bottle that did not taste to fresh. Gave up on drinking and went to bed.
And very glad we did not stay longer than 2 nights this is because of the very noisy air flow system running alongside the air conditioning system in each room. As the air conditioning was not needed we thought we could put up with the noise but by midnight on the first night we gave in and called reception only to be told this same problem had been mentioned before we could be moved but no guarantees that the noise levels would be any less. My husband was taken to another room to judge the noise levels and it was no different and so disposable ear phones were offered and a free breakfast in the morning. Fortunately I have an inventive husband who removed the air vent which just lifts down and stuffed a pair of socks in the end of the tube to baffle the noise this did not block the flow but stopped the air from rushing across the vent causing most of the disturbance.
This was all a shame as location perfect for city centre, bed very comfortable, breakfast amazing choice and staff very attentive besides the problems."
2226,MimiS991,2013-05-31,5.0,"Faultless stay Traveled with a hen do but had a room on my own. The room was great, everything you could want, good tea and coffee facilities, mac, hair dryer, full sized iron and board, safe and a good selection of toiletries in the shower room! That's just the things I found as didn't open every cupboard and drawer! Comfy bed, room was lovely and light with a big window, I had a view of the road but didn't notice any noise.
The only slight niggle is the car park. The spaces were so small! I got the last one that you could fit a car in, there were a couple others but there was no way I was getting in them! Didn't really mind the £10 charge, would cost you that anywhere overnight and you can walk most places from them hotel.
Breakfast was good, staff were friendly.
Would definitely stay again :)"
2227,lollypop101,2013-03-31,4.0,"Nice Hotel in Bristol, Clean & Comfortable Rooms in a good location We stayed here a few weeks back for one night, and found it to be a nice hotel. We came by train, and the hotel was around a 10-15 minute walk to the hotel from Temple Meads Station. 

The staff were friendly, and managed to get us into our room earlier than the usual check-in time as we arrived early. We had a ""garden view"" room, although I couldn’t really see much garden from the window(!).
 
I booked this hotel through Hilton direct, over the phone, and used my Hilton Hhonours points, so it didn't cost anything. Being a Silver member we got a free newspaper and bottled water too.

I am glad we didn’t bring our car, because it was rather expensive to park overnight (I think around £15.00).

We walked into Bristol City Centre for a bite to eat, and this was about another 10 minute walk. 
The rooms were clean, comfortable and modern, no problems at all (apart from the apple mac in the room kept giving us static electric shocks! I was scared to touch it after a while!)

Overall a nice hotel, I would recommend, and use them again in the future."
2228,Spencer1982Belfast,2013-05-31,5.0,"2nd Time - Just as good This is the 2nd time I have stayed at the hotel in the last few months and can honestly say it was a great experience.  Friendly and helpful staff!  Comfortable room.  Had 1 small issue on arrival with the air-con in room however this was resolved within 15 mins.

Theres an Italian place which is recommended about a minutes walk from here and a Tesco express too."

I would recommend the Hotel for convenient for the City. There wasn't a massive load of atmosphere the restaurant was fairly sparsely attended, I had a burger it was fine. I would come back again for a single trip on business. I did feel looked after. Thank you to al."

The staff throughout the hotel were polite and friendly, Saturday night service in the restaraunt was a bit slow but it was very busy, food was lovely and plenty of it....breakfast plenty to choose from...a good selection of morning and evening papers if you so desired !! cannot fault this hotel at all...very pleasant stay. Thank you."

2233,AshpoleNorthampton,2013-04-30,4.0,"""Deal or no Deal"" We booked this hotel so that we could attend the filming of the TV game show ""Deal or no Deal"".  It was conveniently located for the studio and took about 20 minutes to walk there.  We were on a bed and breakfast plus evening meal plan and the food was excellent value, nicely presented and tasted amazing!  Good location for walking around Bristol.  The only downside was it was hot in the room as the window only opened the minutest amount and the air conditioning didn't cope as the room over the park was in full sunlight."
2234,875karenb,2013-05-31,5.0,"Good location and friendly staff A ten minute walk brings you into central Bristol with its various shops, restaurants and bars. The Hilton is also a couple of minutes walk from the main line station. So the best of both worlds. The hotel rooms aren't huge but they have everything you need. Including an apple mac computer which is free to use. Breakfast's how ever great with lots to chose from. We will definitely return"
2235,T6108RLcarolinel,2013-05-31,4.0,"Lovely, friendly staff. Just check the details! This hotel has a good location, walking distance from the train station and slightly longer from town. Very friendly staff, a very handy 24hr ""pantry"" with various snacks, drinks (including alcohol, with a weekend special), toiletries, and even microwaveable meals, available for purchase (pay at reception). And a microwave. I suppose you get plates from the restaurant if you want them. Anyway, it's a better idea than a minibar - and more reasonably priced.

The room itself was lovely, with an interesting feature of an imac that doubles as a tv. Which is fine, although the only disadvantage I could see was it meant you couldn't turn the tv on from bed, if you wanted to. You could turn it off with the remote, but not on. Ah well. The free wifi was appreciated.

The cupboards seemed to have lights inside that turn on when the door is opened, but these weren't working in my room. Well, the lights in the wardrobe flashed briefly and went out. I guess the bulbs need changing. In other electronic malfunctions, the lifts were apparently out of order for my first full day there. Well, the hotel was very busy that day - maybe they collapsed under the strain. They worked when I needed to move my luggage.

The staff, while lovely, could be described as a bit scatty. My first dinner reservation went completely AWOL. I was on a dine & wine deal, which meant dinner, with wine, was included for the duration of my stay. I was too late to avail of it the first evening, so got a breakfast voucher instead. Next day, had a good breakfast - the option to make your own waffles is one I haven't seen before - and, as I had been advised, made a reservation for dinner that evening. When I arrived for dinner, the restaurant was crammed, but I said I'd be happy to sit in the bar. Which was lucky, because I then got the option of choosing from the bar menu, which I preferred to the set restaurant menu that comes with this offer, but I was allowed to choose a dessert from the restaurant menu.

On the second evening, the restaurant was much less crowded and I had to choose from the set restaurant menu. Which had the same main courses as the day before. O dear. Well, I did my best, but it just wasn't to my taste, and the brownie I ordered for dessert, which took a solid half hour to arrive, tasted stale.

Check-out was a bit harrowing. After a long-ish queue, I was presented with a bill for about £34. What?! My only charge was one breakfast - I had only eaten two, and one of those was with a voucher (see above). I asked for an itemised bill, which took a while to print (awkward, I was in a hurry) and which showed a whole cluster of different charges. The girl on check-out seemed confused, and told me I was being charged for three breakfasts. She also told me that breakfast was £12.90 (which amount never appeared on the bill, nor any multiple of it). I had to explain the situation to her several times, at the end of which I wasn't charged for any breakfasts at all! Well, whatever.

Overall, a good trip, with minor quibbles."

2237,Mr_YLS,2013-04-30,2.0,"Terrible We arrived as apart of our wedding anniversary weekend with mxed emotions about coming here in the week.
1- we booked via expedia and had a last minute change (bringing our 4year old) i called the hotel who said quite bluntly they wouldnt do anything as it was booked through a 3rd party and i'd have to call them. SOoooo i did...and the expedia gent couldnt be more helpful saying that this was a common issue and they'd speak to the hotel now and get back with me, a few moments on hold and a shocked expedia agent said they had refuse, like in my earlier call to do anything their and id have to see if i could upgrade upon arrival.
2- so we arrive, and check in - the front car park is a nightmare to manouvere around go out the back you have to pay but at least you'll be able to get out. i explain our issue QUITE CLEARERLY stating she is 4 and they advise they will put an extra bed in the room (brilliant!).
So we get in after a 20 minute wait and they've put in a babys cot??!!
So another complain to reception and we're moved to 2 single bed room with an extra fold out bed. ridiculous.

The room in itself was fine, MACs are cool and with me on the laptop watching rugby, my wife on her kindle and my daughter using the mac to play we could all unwind for a few hours.

Dont bother ordering a taxi we wanted one straight away there was a call put in 3 taxis outside for some bloke who wanted in 45 minutes later and they wouldnt take us - god knows where ours went.
So we eneded up, frustrated and annoyed, walking to where we wanted to go!
Another thing that was alarming was that my wife ended up leaving two items of clothing in the room which have mysteriously gone missing?? No call back either."
2238,nnmercman,2013-04-30,4.0,"STAG WEEKEND Travelled to Bristol with a large group for a stag weekend and didn't know where we were staying until arrival.  This was slightly unnerving as usually I plan where I'm staying and do a bit of research beforehand.  However,  the hotel was fine and only about 5 minutes walk from the station.  It looked fairly new although the corridor carpets were being replaced during our stay.  The room had everything we required - the bathroom (shower only) was a bit on the small size but there were a good selection of toiletries and it was clean.  

The walk to the city centre was just over 10 minutes and there was plenty of choice for bars,  clubs and restaurants.  However,  they were geared to a younger crowd than my age group and as the oldest I bowed out around midnight both nights to let the others ""get on with it"".  On Saturday we spent the day at Max events (near the M5 towards Cribbs Causeway) and took part in off road buggies,  Clay shooting and paintball.  overall it was ok but disorganised with a fair bit of waiting around - especially between paintball games.  Fortunately the weather was chilly but not wet which was a plus.

We had breakfast on both days and would recommend waiting until around 0930hrs on Saturday and 1030hrs on Sunday as unless you get there at opening time it can be full and and you'll have to wait whilst items are replaced.  Also,  table service for tea etc will be slower.  That having said,  there was a good selection of food,  eggs can be cooked to order and there was a waffle machine for those with a bit more patience than me.  A larger toaster (or more) would be a suggestion but on the second morning I got into the knack of taking toast already at the bottom of the machine which guests had either forgotten or more likely intended to retrieve as they couldn't be bothered to wait for the cycle to complete (my thanks to them for saving my time!).

If I had a gripe it would be regarding the bedside clock - ours showed the wrong time and we couldn't work out how to change it.  My assumption was that it automatically updated but even the receptionist admitted to not knowing how to change the display time - perhaps some Brain of Britain will let me know the answer in their review?

There's a Tesco Express just the other side of the park and as rooms have an empty fridge you can stock up with drink etc."
2239,StanleyLivingstone,2013-04-30,1.0,"A disgrace. Booked by telephone for two nights through Hilton Reservations.

Contacted the hotel the evening before arrival to advise them of my  intended arrival time at the hotel, ask about parking facilities and to give them my contact details.

Imagine my surprise and disgust upon arrival to find that there were no rooms available at this particular inn. The place was overbooked, but they 'would try and rebook me somewhere else'... 

I asked the very nice and apologetic lady at the front desk to see the operations manager or the general manager, but was advised there was no manager on site.

It transpired other guests were also being turned away and had been waiting for accommodation at other hotels for some time. This, so I was advised, was normal policy at this hotel.

When they tried to rebook me at the nearby Mercure, no rooms were available. 

I asked if the Bristol Hilton was near the airport and if it was available, but was told this was much more expensive. I told them I didn't care, as they would be paying the bill, which in fairness they eventually did.

Yes, the Hilton was near the airport and had rooms, so off we went, but not before Sylvia at the front desk for her kind efforts.

The Hilton turned out to be on the opposite end of town from the airport, but they were welcoming and friendly and actually had rooms. Although they were not owned by the same proprietors as the Garden Inn, they did everything they could to make up for the dismal failures of the Garden Inn. 

A call to the Garden Inn a couple of days later in the hope of speaking to the Operations Manager or the General Manager netted the response that I could have their email addresses... I was eventually told they were not in the office, but would call me back.

You've guessed it: I am still waiting.

Overbooking is bad enough, not having alternative accommodation arranged pretty poor, but not informing me when I have spoken to the hotel the previous evening and they have my contact details is quite simply a disgrace and a long way from the Hilton promise!

If you want somewhere reliable, trustworthy and customer focused and friendly to stay, this clearly isn't the place."

We arrived by car , charge is £10 per night for parking , token is given by reception for exit barrier. Disabled bay is free .Our room was a garden view , which is at the rear of the hotel and very quiet. Would have preferred a window which opened , but there is an easy to use air con . The rooms are clean , small shower room but everything you need for a comfortable stay including shower gel, shampoo, body lotion, shower cap, wash mit. Ironing board and iron are provided in a cupboard next to the bathroom. Hair dryer in top drawer of dressing table. Television is by means of free wi fi , very handy for checking e-mails , and able to google info on local restaurants etc.There is a restaurant within the hotel but only a room service menu was provided. We didn't eat there so cannot comment . We used the late bar and the young chap who served us was lovely.
There were 6 of us in total , we had 3 rooms for 3 nights and all of us found the staff very helpful & cheerful . Most especially the service from JANE at breakfast each morning . Even on an extremely busy Sunday morning she still made sure that our whole family were seated quickly and all together. Nothing seemed too much trouble for her and she remained so efficient even at the busiest of times. Breakfast was ample , hot buffet was replenished frequently , eggs cooked to order and even a waffle maker available which really pleased our young granddaughter."
2242,Jteezy101,2013-04-30,4.0,"A good stay... This hotel is nice, but what makes it that bit better is the service that is provided by the staff there. They really helped us when looking for place to go, and they really do try to do what is in there power to make the stay comfortable.
One alight issue was that we didn't get told about breakfast being till 10 on the weekdays and at 12 on the weekend so we came down at 11:15 for breakfast only to find it had finished at 10. But the staff were very helpful and made us some tea which was very nice. 
The location of the hotel was very good near the city center. But the hotel does charge £10 a day to keep your car in there car park which I don't think is right if we are paying to stay there. 
Would stay there again. No questions asked."

Our twin room was modern and clean with a park view. The staff were friendly and helpful. The location was brilliant, in-between the main shopping area and the waterside, both being easily walkable. 
Sunday morning was busy at breakfast but plenty of staff on duty and the car park was busy but this would definitely not put me off returning."

Check-in and check-out times are slightly later/ earlier than most hotels which I found quite cheeky. Particularly as the cleaning staff start making noise in the hotel early so even on a Sunday we couldn't have a particularly long lie-in. Also, whilst we were having an afternoon nap, someone entered our room without knocking but left as soon as I woke up and didn't give me enough time to see who it was. The reception staff assured me it could only have been the cleaning, but they should still have knocked."

Simply the best location, handy for the train station and the city is but minutes away, it is a great place to walk out and enjoy Bristol.

Breakfast was good and there was a lot of choice.

2251,smiler67,2013-04-30,3.0,"Good but a few problems behind the scenes We recently stay here during our recent business trip to Bristol.  On check-inn we were greeted by the receptionist who mumbled something to us, it was only on asking her to repeat herself a couple of times did we eventually understand her as she mumbled thoughout the conversation.  She took our details and promptly told us that there would be a £50 per night( that was £300 as we were staying for 6 nights) reservation put on our credit card just incase we wanted to eat or drink something at the bar, we told her that this would not be the case but she insisted that this has to happen.  On checking our credit card another £100 had been reserved without our knowledge.  This was rather off-putting as us being a small business have to keep an eye on our cash flow as you may understand.

Once checked in I was surprised by the size of the room, it was the smallest room I have stayed in for sometime and the bathroom although being well equipped was very very small, my husband had to contort himself to get into the shower..  On first impressions the room seemed clean but of close inspection there was dust behind the side tables and the bed, mould on the ceiling in the bathroom and on the shower screen.  There was also a rather cumbersome chair placed in the room which had to be moved to enable us to get into the wardrope. The IMAC in the room is certainly not needed and would have preferred a proper flat screen TV.  When trying to watch TV at night the service failed on numerous occasions ( probably due to the strain on the internet)

Another thing is to point out is the lack of acknowledgement when entering the hotel, on almost every occasion either whilst leaving the hotel no acknowledgment was made  this was a little concerning to me from a security point of view.  

This hotel was certainly not in the same league as other Hilton Hotels I have stayed at in the past.  The points I have addressed are not really complaints but should be addressed."

On arrival staff were very pleasant and helpful and we were able to check in at 11 to our rooms no problem.
This hotel is in a great position close to the train station (5-10 min walk) and to the city centre (10-15 min walk) so perfect for what we were after this weekend.
Our room was clean tidy and comfortable and the shower was lovely and a decent size.
The reception staff were very friendly and the lovely man cooking the fried eggs. 
The restaurant did become a little busy so either go early or around 10am to avoid 9 am  rush as the restaurant is quite small.
We added breakfast on when we checked in and got 2 breakfasts for £15 instead of the £13.99 so I would advise this :-)

The parking is very cramped and alot of glass was on the ground too which worried me of the safety of the cars but all was well.
The hotel is very nicely decorated the staff friendly and the room is very well equipped. The iMac is a nice novelty but the speakers did not work very well which was disappointing as i couldn't use my phone to listen to music.
The only fault with the room was the heat, it was very hot despite being cold outside, the window barely opens and we had the air con on but that didn't seem to do much apart from give us both headaches and sinus trouble the following day which is something we don't normally suffer from.

2259,Neilliv,2013-04-30,4.0,"excellent base for city break. I had stayed at this hotel in it's previous guise of the City Inn, and so was more than pleased to go back to the same place. It's not quite in the centre of Bristol, but is about a 10 minute stroll to the main areas where there are plenty of bars, cafe, restaurants etc.The reception staff were very courteous and helpful, and the rooms were comfortable if not particularly large. We only had a breakfast which was adequate with a choice of hot and cold dishes from a buffet, but the dining room can get very busy especially at weekends. A couple of recommendations - there is a fantastic Sardinian bistro called Marco's across the churchyard at the back of the hotel, so a 2 minute walk. Fabulous food, lovely waiting staff, and a great ambience. Secondly if you are in centre of Bristol on a Saturday night, and find everywhere busy (which it usually is!) go to the Watershed cafe/bar where there are usually tables free and the food is also excellent with a choice of small and main meals."
2260,278nareshs,2013-03-31,4.0,"Got the basics right Pros:
- Clean, well furnished. Nice shower.
- Breakfast was very nice. 
- Great location in between Broadmead and Harbourside, half a mile from each. 
- Apple TV was fab as were the speakers. 

Cons:
- I wouldn't trust the drinks at the bar. The amount of little flies i saw flying around one area was quite disgusting. I found out the hard way during lunch when I found 3 of them in my drink after I had already gone through half of it. I let them know and one of the staff informed me it's a problem they're aware of. As they poured me another glass I kept my eyes peeled and saw a LOT of tiny flies suddenly fly up and away. Quite frankly it ruined my lunch as I was left wondering how many of them I had consumed in my drink. I was very relieved it was isolated to the bar and not the food.
- No room service available after 10pm. We were caught out by this one night and ordered a Dominos. 
- Rooms are very small.
- Aircon kept giving me some minor sinus issues in the morning which is a first for me at any hotel.

Overall:
Very pleased with the stay."
2261,Surrey361,2013-04-30,4.0,"Great for station Less than 5 mins walk to TempleMeads, but make sure you use Temple Quay exit from station.  Efficient, friendly check in/out.  Spacious room.  Comfortable bed. Plenty of hanging/storage space.  Iron, safe, good tea/coffee etc. Tv via Imac computer (although a lot of listed channels, including all Sky ones did not work).  Good bathroom (large walk in shower not bath). Good soundproofing/blackout curtains.  Some negatives - hotels seemed pristine throughout but room had a squatted spider on wall and some sticky patches on carpet (I sense these were exceptions rather than rule to hotel cleanliness); constant low level buzzing from bathroon extractor could be heard all night (sadly a common feature of modern hotels).  Breakfast (good value at 7.95 offered on check out not at 13.50 standard) was good with food being constantly replenished by efficient staff (although promised croissants never arrived) but very busy with mainly large groups of what I assumed to be hen parties (again sensed our problem bad timing so exception rather than rule).

The pillows where extra comfy could have easily slipped them in my suitcase.   Don't book through comparison sites we got an excellent deal by phoning Hilton direct.   The food was very good and the staff extremely courteous and helpful.
2265,gavin22y,2013-04-30,5.0,"Excellent Hotel whether you're on business, trip away, or stag do! I've stayed in Hilton's a few times, and they've always consistently been good hotels. They're unlikely to be the cheapest, but when they come to value you get bang for your buck, and it is really the little as well as big things Hilton Hotels do so well. 

We stayed over the Easter Weekend for a Stag Do, sensibly (though we aren't a rowdy bunch) they put us on the 1st floor so we would only disturb ourselves when coming back in the early hours. The hotel is very central for the station if you opt for the train, or if you wish to drive they have a 50 space carpark £10 for 24hrs. The hotel is only about a 10 minute walk into the city centre and nearby shopping centre. 

On arrival we were quickly checked in by a cheery receptionist and give our room keys, my room was a decent size and nice and quiet, the bed was very comfy. A nice little touch is having an iMac in your room, meaning you can go on the net, play music, or watch TV and it's all included in the room price. The bathroom was a decent size, though only had a shower rather than bath, the water was hot I would have preferred a more powerful shower but it was adequate enough, obviously too used to power showers! Curtains were good quality blackout ones as well, which I always find good so you're able to get a quality nights sleep, another good thing which I find I can't always get right in the room is the room temperature. I like a cool room and here that wasn't a problem.  

We had a number of heavy nights and don't like to get up very early, a real win with The Hilton is the fact that on the weekend and bank holidays breakfast runs till midday. This is very rare for most hotels, normally running breakfast till around 10. The selection and food was excellent, from a full English to continental, fresh fruit, yoghurt, pastries, there really is something for everyone, and plenty of it. Should you want an omelette or salmon then all you do is ask your waiter or waitress and they will send your order to the kitchen to cook fresh. I had the salmon one day which was very nice. 

All in all it was an enjoyable stay, and I'd recommend it to everyone apart from maybe a romantic trip away where a boutique hotel maybe more suitable."
2266,Myrtyl,2013-03-31,4.0,"Policy on hen and stag dos may need looking at Stayed a Friday and Saturday night here. Hotel is a few minutes walk from Temple Meads station and no more than ten minutes walk into city centre. Check in was fast friendly and efficient. Room was fine - garden view meaning they look over the old Temple church and gardens rather than he busy main road.

Bathrooms are very small with only a shower. Bed ok but if you don't like them hard you probably won't like it. Wifi worked fine. Imac in room OK but regular TV would have probably been more welcome.

Breakfast is great and all the staff fantastic. Good buffet plus several other items available to order. 

There is a fitness room but I didnt check this out.

Now the problem...  Friday night was wonderfully quiet and peaceful.... Saturday a hen do checked in to the rooms in the corridor. To summarise politely, they weren't a very well brought up bunch whose behaviour was unacceptable. Coupled with two rooms being occupied by some clubbers who kept playing loud music and thinking it hilarious to knock on all the doors with do not disturb on, it was destined to be a rubbish night's sleep. Obviously when the ignorant members of the hen party returned in the early hours, they continued to shout swear and bang doors for the next hour or so.

Reception did tell the music players to turn the music down. But hotel staff when an obviously drunken noisy grop return in the middle of the night need to be proactive and monitor them. 

The hotel can't be responsible for guests behaviour but they have a duty of care to the majority of guests who have often paid a lot of money and who do behave like adults. Hilton must have known that this was a hen party booking. At breakfast the next morning there were also some men from a stag party so it seems policy to accept this downmarket clientele

Such a shame as it ruins the rest of the hotel and the good work done by most of the staff

At least Premier Inn guarantee a good nights sleep so you could get your money back with them

Don't stay here if you want to have a good night's sleep!"
2267,TravellerOxfordshire,2013-03-31,4.0,"Good place to stay We stayed at this hotel for the night last Saturday/Sunday  (23-4 march) 
A nice hotel, close to the town centre so you can walk there in about 10 minutes . Good for shopping and the local nightlife. Staff more than helpful and very friendly with our modest requests.

Our Room was clean an comfortable. It had all the usual features you'd expect in a medium quality upmarket hotel suite. Walk in shower, comfortable bed, Our room over looked the old Bristol abbey rather than the main road out front. 

One novel feature was a MAC instead of a TV in the room. It took a while to get used to if your a PC sort of person like me.

A good thing for me  was the room had its own fridge., So we bought some wine and nibbles and was able to keep them cool in the room.  

The hotel has its own car park, But you have to pay £10 a night for it's use. I feel this should be provided free to hotel patrons. Parking in Bristol is at a premium, so a hotel with its own car park is a bonus.

Would stay there again if visiting the city."
2268,cupidscapers,2013-03-31,3.0,"Enjoyable, apart from the noisy air-conditioning. My husband I stayed here for a recent weekend away. However, the weekend was marred for us because of the air-conditioning & extractor fan in the bathroom. We were originally upgraded to a 5th floor room that was over-looking the park, however it was like sleeping on a noisy ferry. The fan in the bathroom did not turn off atall, and the air-conditioning units on the roof made a continual hum. About midnight we had to ask to move rooms as the staff couldn't turn off the fan in the bathroom. However the room we were moved to on the 3rd floor had exactly the same problem - the bathroom extractor fan ran constantly!
We resorted to buying earplugs for the 2nd night!
Other than that the rooms were nice, although not sure why they have so many chairs in them when they are such small rooms? The air-conditioning didn't seem to heat the room, although the weather is exceptionally cold at the moment.
The breakfast was great - I loved the waffles, making them fresh is a delcious way to start the day."
2269,Antz2010,2013-03-31,5.0,"Great location, facilities and staff. Booking this hotel will fore-fill your expectations - we were very pleased.

Parking is charged £10.00 per night. 
Very good sleep experience and bathrooms."
2270,ChiragK991,2013-03-31,4.0,"Very good overall - nice rooms (iMacs), breakfast could be better. The iMacs are a nice touch and the TV feature on them works flawlessly. The room was modern and well furnished but they are rather on the small side. The heating could have been better and breakfast needed refreshing the Marriott City Centre is excellent on these fronts and thus the Hilton is judged against a high benchmark. Very happy overall - just small improvements suggested to get to 'Excellent'."
2271,Barrovian134,2013-03-31,4.0,"Great staff - Average staff - Easy to see the difference The bed is extremely comfy - a little too comfy, and the room was spotlessly clean and maintained that way throughout the stay. The cleaning staff were always polite and pleasant when I ran into them
The staff, firstly let me say that the Receptionist Annie is an absolute godsend, efficient, polite, knowledgable and helpful a real credit to the hotel and the Hilton chain.
The staff on duty on Monday 18th and Tuesday 19th (reception, bar and restaurant)  were excellent, the food was well cooked and tasty.
The staff on Wednesday were .... erm.... average except for the afore mentioned Annie, Breakfast just seemed dis-organised and the food was not a patch on Tuesday's. Checking out was a bit of a trial when trying to get my company's name on the bill.
Overall a recommended Hotel and perfectly placed just off the city centre but close enough to walk and would qualify for 5 out 5 if not for the inconsistent staff."
2272,Cymru63,2013-03-31,4.0,"Very convenient, comfortable hotel Excellent stay at this hotel last weekend. Comfortable, clean rooms and well laid out public areas. Only a short walk from Bristol Temple Meads station if you're travelling by rail, but quite a small car park so parking can be difficult when the hotel is busy. Excellent self service breakfast. Free wi-fi throughout the hotel and an Apple TV in each room - impressive.

Particular praise for Tatijana behind the bar - friendly service with a smile!"
2273,Nodrog36,2013-03-31,4.0,"Good City Centre Hotel My wife and I stayed at the Garden Inn on a recent visit to Bristol and Bath. The hotel is only a short walk from Temple Meads Railway Station and looks to be in an area surrounded by offices. Check-in was smooth and we were allocated a room on the fifth floor, which was compact but it was more than we needed for our weekend break. An added bonus was the good quality toiletries that were supplied. 

Breakfast was a bit frantic as the hotel appeared to be really busy, but there was plenty to eat and we left for a day out in Bath with a good cooked breakfast to set us up for the day. The hotel may be surrounded by offices but within about a 500 metre radius there are at least four great real ale pubs which was a nice bonus. 

The hotel provided good quality accommodation at a reasonable price, what more can you ask for?"
2274,baddy95,2013-03-31,4.0,"Clean hotel staff friendly. Stayed for a weekend break and were warmly greeted by a friendly face. Were lucky enough to get one of the last parking places. The room was spotlessly clean with everything we needed for a short break. Breakfast was a bit of a srum thou. Waited ages for a table and staff were struggling to cope with the demand. They worked really hard but not enough staff were working at peake times. Breakfast was good thou with plenty of choice. 
If we were to visit bristol again we would stay here."
2275,EvetheLondoner,2013-03-31,4.0,"Hilton wins again Service, quality and ease sum up this stay, which is just what you expect from a Hilton.
We booked last min for a one night stay so that we'd be well situated for an early morning meeting.  The room was well equipped for the business user complete with imac, channels and broadband at no extra cost.  Given that many chains charge for wifi, this was a welcome extra.
We paid an additional £10 for secure on site parking so do take note if you do have a car.

Perfect and functional for our needs, this hotel is well situated for Temple Meads train, and a 7 min walk to the restaurants/bars in town."
2276,golb20,2013-03-31,3.0,Disappointing stay at a Hilton hotel This hotel is the Hilton equivalent of a budget hotel.  Which is fine if that's what you think you are paying for.  As the rooms are small and the service at check in and for breakfast was very disorganised. Staff at breakfast were more interested in cleaning away the tables. Than ensuring there was fresh food available for  the remaining guests.
2277,JulieMaryWalsh,2013-03-31,5.0,"Excellent value for money Very helpful staff. well equipped rooms. Lovely view and my teenage son was delighted with the iMac. Good breakfast,we made our own waffles - again the staff were really helpful. Would highly recommend it. We had a lovely view of the park, cost slightly more but worth it."
2278,air-we-go-again,2013-03-31,5.0,"Fantastic stay This is a very clean, well located stop over that offered more than I first thought.

Staff were awesome! They all seemed genuinely happy to help which is such a refreshing change these days.

Rooms are very well soundproofed, clean and kept well. Shower was spotless !! Nutrogena products, Apple Mac tv !!! Tea coffee and ironing facilities !!

Breakfast was a bun fight but it was Sunday morning.

If I return to Bristol this is where I shall stay!!

Well done Hilton !"
2279,RKMS151,2013-02-28,5.0,"Brilliant value for money stay This hotel is located centrally in Bristol, walking distance from Temple Meads station.  The hotel is extremely clean and functional, an ideal place to stay for a business visit.  The hotel stood out for me because the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The car park is pretty small for the size of the hotel although parking wasn't a problem on my visit."
2280,Jorganmeister,2013-03-31,4.0,"Typically Capable Hilton Experience Another former Mint/City Inn property, this is a relatively small hotel, but provides a good level of service with comfortable if compact rooms. Rooms have a good level of equipment including the signature I-mac TV/computer but are quite crowded with a desk chair and a lounge chair.

overall though - friendly, efficient, quiet (at least at the rear of the property and a 15 minute walk from the waterfront area."
2281,carolineg823,2013-03-31,4.0,"Excellent value and service Visiting Bristol for an overnight theatre trip, we booked a double room for one night. This hotel was perfect - opposite a park on one side, walking distance to all the central sites, and convenient for transport.  However what marked it out for me were the very friendly and helpful staff, our spotlessly clean, quiet, and well-designed room, and small attention to detail (crisp bedlinen, and a state of the art, designer desk chair, perfect for my bad back).  It's not a luxury hotel, but it delivered in all the essential areas and I'd certainly not look any further when I visit Bristol again for a short stay.  Breakfast was good, not exceptional, but there were specials we could have ordered from the kitchen which we didn't try - and again, we had very good service."
2282,LikelyCulprit,2013-03-31,4.0,"Does the basics really well, good staff, finer detail not 100% This is a good value hotel which I've stayed at before when it was the City Inn and the the Mint. Hilton seem to have refreshed the rooms with new carpet and paint which has been done well. 

It's a budget style operation - decent rates, modest size rooms, tiny bathroom etc. But where it scores extra points is that it is clean, modern, extremely comy beds, and the staff seem genuinely interested in helping out. And the computers in each room are a brilliant touch which other hotels really ought to follow - it gives you TV, radio etc but with free internet access too. 

The bits that are a let down are really quire minor and not exactly worth worrying about in the great scheme of things. Some wear and tear was evident - bulb out, bare wire on the PC mouse cable etc. Annoyingly the aircon diagram on the wall didnt match the controls which made things confusing. 

A tasty buffet breakfast, efficient service. But sadly it was lukewarm due to a combination of cold plates and the food itself being kept below an ideal temperature. Great shame because it was jolly tasty fare. Nice touch was the eggs fired to order whilst you wait. 

In all I'd happily stay again and would feel pleased if my company books me here."
2283,RayK363,2013-03-31,4.0,"Good staff made all the difference A functional, well located hotel and serving some of the best breakfast food I've ever had. My companion & I arrived too late to expect much in the way of service but to our surprise the reception staff ordered in our food whilst the bar staff, Tatjana that is, stayed open to us as required & ensured very late hospitality. Well done indeed."
2284,504gld,2013-03-31,3.0,"Quality rooms, a few niggles though. Upon arrival at 2.30pm the car park was completely full.  I ended up having to park, like some other guests on yellow hashed areas parked for delivery.  The spaces are tiny in the main bays and the person arriving in a minibus would of had no chance.  

The downside to this, is a £10 overnight parking fee.  This I feel isn't acceptable when the car park isn't secure, unlike their competitor the Holiday Inn just up the road which charge less and have security gates.

Check in was swift and polite, but there was no information on breakfast or the times it operated.  

My room at first appeared great, however a quick freshen up in the bathroom changed that.  I noticed the bathroom door had a big hand print on the door in what looked like blood.  It might of been make up, but the colour looked odd.  I was given a new room without question, although I had only expected somebody to come and clean it.

The room fixtures and fittings were all excellent.  The fridge, iMAC, JBL Sound System, Iron & Board, all above and beyond most hotels.  Bed excellent and my second room spotlessly clean.

The breakfast next morning was served until 12 as it happens, but this is what stops me rating the hotel with 5 points.  I was seated and served coffee then left, no explanation of help yourself etc.  The table had a menu which said to order from your server, who never came back.  Being vegetarian and wanting to order from the card I went back to the door and spoke to the lady there and requested some items.  I went to the self serve too, but plates were not to be seen, eventually found on a shelf under it.  The selections were very meat heavy, no signs of any mushrooms or hash browns which is unusual.  The toaster just produced a lot of smoke but didn't toast, nobody could seem to get anything other than warm bread out of it.  The fruit bar was practically empty.  The cook to order chef had vanished just leaving a frying pan on the ring and wasn't seen.    I had to ask a second time for my vegetarian order which then suddenly appeared announced very loudly and abrupt  - but to the wrong table.   I wasn't offered any further coffee or too see if everything was ok.     This was a complete let down.

Overall:  Poor breakfast - Poor Parking 

For £75 one night B&B+Parking they really need to raise their game as it didn't stack up as good value."

The breakfast was good and hot.  I would certainly recommend this to anybody, and would definitely stay there again."

We were actually eating elsewhere that evening but asked if we could just have our wine in the bar before we went out. To our amazement we were offered one full bottle of wine/prosecco with each room. We could not believe how good this offer was for the already discounted rate we had for the room! We were also given a selection of starters and nibbles in with the price.

Hotel was being rennovated whilst we were there so smelled a little of paint, but can't grumble at all due to the price we paid!"

2289,eyedeebees,2013-03-31,3.0,"Bristol Hotel - Good stay but could be better We stayed at the Garden  Inn for 2 nights in early March. It is well located for central Bristol, close to the waterfront and in easy walking distance of everything in the centre. Staff are pleasant and welcoming and the bedroom on the top floor was spotless. While overlooking the dull dual carriageway it was quiet and no noise carried. It had 8 hangers in the wardrobe - an area so many hotels pay little attention to, an imac, and free wifi without any connectivity details required. All of this made a very good first impression  The toilet was a bit small, but hardly a complaint.

What let the hotel down in our view was breakfast and parking.  Let's start with the latter. when we arrived on Friday we nabbed the last place outside the hotel in the electronic barrier controlled parking and that was fine. The charge is £10 for 24 hours which seemed perfectly reasonable. On our second day in Bristol we took our car and returned at 5pm when there were no spaces and we parked on the street. We went out again across town, and on return at 11 p.m. there were still no spaces and we parked for free on the deserted street one block away and did not feel comfortable leaving our car in that area. The hotel has inadequate parking facilities.     

Breakfast is not good. Inadequate facilities for number of guests - scrambled eggs were cold as last portion- when they ran out there was no replacement. Choice of bread is white sliced or brown sliced.  Best not to dwell on it, but in comparison to the other Hiltons at which we have stayed this was a huge disappointment. We would recommend not paying for this meal."
2290,andrewfS6870DE,2013-02-28,5.0,"Smart, chic and efficient Well, theTV is an iMac! The carpets have tread inches deep and the room was as smart as any hotel I have ever been in.

The hotel was ideally located to explore the city an was very near Bristol temple meads station. On arrival at the hotel the reception staff were very helpful. The room we stayed in was small but what you expect for a city centre hotel. The room was spotlessly clean and beautifully maintained and had everything you need for a perfect weekend away. We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening as we had made other plans but if the restaurant was to be judged by the standard of the breakfast then it would get a 10/10 from me. The staff at breakfast were exceptionally helpful and went the extra mile. We will definitely return.

2295,l0vaduck,2013-02-28,5.0,"Home from home I have stayed here for 12 nights on business and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the accommodation.

The hotel is clearly geared up for business travellers.  The three rooms I stayed in were virtually identical. The differences were: one was the mirror image of the other two; one had a much larger bedside table - useful if you want to keep a drink of water by the bed - this one (on the fifth floor) also had decent sized mugs, unlike the other two where the mugs were really only cup-sized.

A good range of toiletries was provided: soap; shower gel; shampoo; conditioner; body lotion; mouthwash; shower cap; vanity kit; flannel. The bath towel was a generous size - unusual for a hotel where in my experience you normally only get a minimum sized fairly scratchy towel - these were large and soft. Everything I used was replaced next day - similarly the tea, coffee and milk.

The air conditioning was efficient, although I only needed to adjust it on one or two days. 

The best thing in the room was the iMac - with free internet access and several TV and radio channels, this was a really welcome touch.

The restaurant was probably the most disappointing aspect with a very limited menu - one evening there was no vegetarian main course and when I pointed this out was offered one of the starters as a main. I'm not sure what I would have had as a starter! I had the cheese board instead, which was fine. 

Breakfast offered a good choice, however the service was not always very efficient. As well as the range of items on the buffet it was possible to order freshly cooked eggs, porridge, vegetarian sausages and smoked salmon.  Several times I witnessed the ordered items being delivered to the wrong table and people waiting for quite some time for their food to arrive as a result. Tea was brought to the tables but on occasions was extremely weak. There were also flasks of tea and coffee available but unfortunately tea from the flask tasted of coffee. I'm surprised nobody has realised that you can't use a flask previously used for coffee for much else as it taints whatever it is used for.

While we were there it was Pancake day but there were no pancakes on the menu - not even for breakfast, and though we asked for them, were refused. There was, however, free birthday cake on the hotel's birthday!

Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel as there are plenty of restaurants nearby in Cabot Circus and it's also walking distance from Za Za Bazaar, where you can eat as much as you like for £15. The hotel is also very convenient for Temple Meads station."

2299,Lala_Tink2008,2013-02-28,4.0,"Hen Weekend Stay!! My wife arrived at this hotel on the 2/2/2013 for a one stay as in Bristol for a hen night.

Check-In, Check-in was easy, simple and efficient. A friend was sharing the twin room and on her arrival my wife was notified straight away by the receptionist and was asked if it was ok for her friend to be sent up to the room. My wife felt that this was excellent security measure as the reception had clearly noted my wife was travelling alone. Top marks to Hilton for this.

Room, Clean and comfortable, and the shower was nice and hot. Another notable feature of the room was a fully functioning Apple Mac PC which was also the TV!! Also is we have stayed in Hilton hotels before, my wife did not have to re-register to join the WIFI network. Top marks for that.

Food, Did not have evening meal but made use of the Pantry service after our night out. Breakfast was excellent although the toaster was not working, but it not effect the breakfast as she did not eat any.

Overall, An excellent hotel for weekends and business travellers due to it's location in the city. One downside is the size of the car park for the hotel. This is very small and not big enough for the hotel and the number of customers it serves and they charge you £10 to boot. There is street parking nearby but it only free from 18:00 Saturdays. Overall it was a decent stay for £69.00 per room including breakfast."

They all seemed to know it was my birthday and all wished me a Happy Birthday!  I woulod highly recommend this hotel and will certainly return when next in Bristol.  The hotel is well located within 10 minute walk to shops, nightlife etc.  Ample parking (£10 overnight - although we booked a deal for B&B with free parking.  Again I would like to express my thanks to Silva on the front desk (you are a Diamond)"

Especially loved the waffle maker at breakfast but a great choice for all tastes and diets. The room itself was decorated lovely, and liked the little touches. Top location also. Would definitely stay there again, great value for money."
2308,weegram,2013-02-28,5.0,"Excellent simple as that THE loation is spot on being 5 minutes walk from temple meads train station and 5 to 10 minutes walk to the city centre.
Check in went smoothly,then off to the room which was Excellent very bright and i would think very new going off the apperence i was in a twin room there was plenty of room to move around.
there was a wardrobe a small fridge which had probably been a mini  bar at some time, above that in the same cupboard was a electronic safe there was a desk/working surface where there was a apple mac tv a key board and external speakers.OH AND THE WIFI IS FREE, unlike the Hilton at Newport i had stayed in the previous night where they charged "" £14.99 per night)
Back to the room at the desk/workstation was a very comfertable computer chair,there was a good quality deep pile carpet, the beds where comfertable with good quality mattresses that were'nt too soft,on the bedside table was a radio alarm what a nice touch the radio that is as it had buttons on the top marked rock, pop,classical country easy listening and others, so you don't have to mess around tuning into specific stations.
The bathroom bright with plenty of light plenty of complementry toiletries and towels and a good sized shower, in a cupboard just before the bathroom was an iron and ironing board, also in one of the draws was a hairdryer..everything you need in the room i say it again EXCELLENT !
I ate in the restaraunt after a trawl around Bristol city centre looking for a indian restaraunt.
The staff were very helpful they squezed me in even though they were full.i had home made carrot and ginger soup to start accompanied with a slice of fresh bloomer bread and very tastey it was too my main course i went for chicken with leek mash and green beans the chicken was superb very succulant and the mash lovely and greenbeans very tastey all accompanied with a jus. after the main course i asked one of the waitresses if i could have a cheese board and did it come with brie on she said it did when i told her i do not like brie she said she would exchange it for a cheese that i prefered. now that is what i call good service."
2309,1953moonbase,2013-02-28,5.0,"Central location My wife and I stayed one night as we were visiting the Hippodrome as a treat for her birthday. 15 min walk to theatre or a 6 pound taxi journey (we took the taxi option). Had a bar meal in the hotel which took 45 mins to arrive.Without prompting we were given 2 complementary drinks each by the apologetic waitress.The staff were all very polite and helpful. Twin room was better than most chain hotels we have stayed in ( Premier inn/Holiday inn),with IMac pc which doubled as a tv. When visiting Bristol again we will choose this hotel."
2310,Scozziemythbuster,2013-02-28,4.0,"Good location, nice rooms Recommended for the location which was excellent. Very helpful cheery service from receptionist at check in. Rooms come equipped with Apple Mac tv, free wifi, brilliant sound from the speakers. Very comfy mattress on bed and good layout to the room. Iron n board, proper hair dyer. Toiletries even include mouthwash and are all neutragena. Speedy service at breakfast, however no porridge on offer. Will consider again"
2311,coughandcath,2013-02-28,3.0,"Only average My wife booked up the hotel as a special treat . It is very well located near to Temple Meads station and only 20 minutes walk away from the harbourside .

The Imac TVs were a real bonus .

I was only disappointed as there were unable to offer firm pillows and as such I didn't sleep well either night . It was a pity that the first person I asked didn't let me know at the time or even get back to me as I would have gone out and brought some from a shop !! It was only when I went down at 11pm to find out where they were I was told they couldn't provide any . Despite my complaint I was not offered anything despite their guaranteed good night"
2312,Man_From_Geneva,2013-02-28,4.0,"Handy hotel for Cardiff, great staff We stayed here for the opening game of the 6 Nations 2013 Rugby Championship as all the hotels in Cardiff were full. This hotel is in a great location just a few minutes from Bristol Temple Meads railway station and Cardiff is only an hour away on the train. It's also a 10 minute walk to the centre of Bristol. 

The hotel staff were just great, nothing was too much trouble and the girl working the breakfast buffet on the Saturday morning of the match had her work cut out for her as the breakfast restaurant was very busy but she handled it all in her stride and with a smile and great service.

The rooms are small but comfortable however my partner didn't sleep too well as the bed was a bit hard and the pillows not the most comfortable.

All in all this is a good hotel ideally located for Cardiff and Bristol town centre."
2313,LindaW744,2013-02-28,5.0,"Modern hotel in central location Fantastic value great facilities and convenient for night life and shopping.
Really enjoyed our stay, staff could not have been more attentive and lovely breakfast. Would recommend to everyone - we got our deal online"
2314,iseestars,2013-01-31,4.0,"Great base for shopping and sightseeing My friend and I stayed in a twin room here on my recommendation, as I had previously stayed in the hotel back in 2010 as a lone traveller on business. As I use Macs for work, I was glad that I didn't have to pack my computer but could use the one in the room instead. Rooms are small but perfectly formed with everything you need. 

The only downside was the group of idiot lads who were staying opposite our room and stank the corridor out with their nasty Lynx aftershave and BO, then woke us up at 2am and again at 4am as they were shouting outside our room and started hammering on our door (presumably as we had a Do Not Disturb sign hanging up they thought this was hilarious...) As two young women staying in the room, we didn't find this as amusing as they did and asked to be moved the next day, which we were, further down the corridor. 

Whilst we were happy with the new room, the whole experience did kind of put us off. As we were still on the same floor, we worried what high jinks our neighbours would get up to the next night and bought earplugs just in case. We hadn't really thought that this hotel was the kind of place that attracted stag parties, but I guess the cheap price will do that! However, the second night we were able to sleep soundly though we were greeted the next morning by one of the lads strolling around the corridor with no shirt on like he was in Magaluf and not Bristol! 

Breakfast on both mornings was great and we got a free glass of wine each on one night as we signed up for the Hilton Honours program. Customer service was great - all the people on reception were very polite and helpful. 

Overall, I would definitely stay here again for a girly weekend, but I would check in future that I'm not going to be in a room surrounded by chavvy delinquents whose idea of a 'wild night in Bristol' was going to Gala bingo... I kid you not..."
2315,Hopeful-Guest,2013-01-31,5.0,"Can't wait to go back We had a fabulous weekend break at this hotel.  The location is only a few minutes walk from the sights.  Room was very comfortable - ask for one at the back overlooking the church if you like peace and quiet.  Free wifi.  Good bed, two chairs, desk and a combined TV, DVD player and computer.

The staff were very friendly and efficient.  A model other hotels could do well to emulate.

The standard of food was extremely high.  Breakfast excellent - either cooked food from the buffet or cooked to order.  Can recommend the scrambled egg on muffin with smoked salmon.

Similarly dinner. Good quality ingredients extremely well presented and cooked.  We had the set menu both nights due to the deal we were on - though still excellent value at £17 on Friday and £19 on Saturday for three courses if booked separately.  Only slight disappointment was that the menu was virtually the same on both nights, though there was plenty of choice so did not need to eat the same thing twice.

Not too keen on being asked to sign an itemised bill after dinner when on DBB with the optional tip box left to fill in - smacks of touting for tips. I may be old fashioned, but do not think that eating in an English hotel should attract a service charge if you are a guest - but realise that this happens abroad.  Unfortunately this practice is starting to creep into the UK."
2316,Sean265,2013-01-31,5.0,"Ideal location with guaranteed Hilton quality First visit to Bristol, so we chose a hotel chain we knew and trusted. Hilton Garden Inns never disappoint with friendly staff, immaculate rooms and public spaces. Nothing is ever a problem whether it's checking in at 9.15am or leaving luggage in storage until ready to head home. As others have stated, the hotel makes an ideal base for visitors being situated close to Temple Meads railway station, which is also where the airport 'Flyer' bus service drops off and picks up. Barely five minutes walking distance from the attraction rich harbour, the hotel is close enough to the Cabot Circus and Broadmeads shopping centres for there to be no need for buses or taxis and as the whole town is pretty much on one level, people with mobility issues should have no problems. On that subject, more mature guests will find the beds especially comfortable and easy to get out of as they have high bases and lovely deep mattresses. They really think of everything from complimentary sewing kits, designer toiletries, free wifi, a Mac pc with JBL surround sound system and a good strong shower. Never ate at the hotel but overheard several business guests praising the food (albeit at a price)! Finally, at no point during our weekend stay did we feel threatened or uncomfortable anywhere - the west country folk are friendly and considerate, so have no misgivings about walking late at night. A memorable stay for all the right reasons."
2317,mairi_ok,2013-01-31,4.0,"Fantastic location,comfortable base Carlos at reception set the tone,friendly,accommodating and helpful. the rooms are on the small side but lots of nice little touches that make a real difference! Comfortable beds and pillows but really nice staff. Walking distance from everything and so close to railway station. Great base for weekend visit"
2318,JoH26,2013-01-31,5.0,"perfect city centre hotel Stayed for the weekend 18-20 January  2013 and really enjoyed it.  The room was immaculate and the shower room  was clean, bright and well supplied.

The interesting thing was that the TV was Apple and could be used as a PC.  No instructions on how to operate this and as the visual depiction of the tiny handset seemed different from the reality, it took some time for us oldies to get online.  The breakfast is sumptuous; with everything from cereal to fruit and yogurt in ample supply.  Then of course there is a supurb hot breakfast with saugages, bacon,eggs, beans, tomatoes and mushrooms.  Add to this loads of tea,coffee and toast and you'll be spoilt for choice. The restaurant staff were willling to fulfil any food requests ,i.e. hot milk for the coffee. On Sunday morning a nice touch was hot waffles with usual accompaniments. The only difficulty was that we could not get our little room fridge to work and didn't have the energy to find out why. The staff at Hilton Garden are welcoming and very friendly.  This is a hotel that I look forward to visiting again."
2319,ttf8,2012-12-31,4.0,"Spot on Great location, no fuss hotel with Mac TV, internet access etc perfect for short stay business trip with assess to local transportation.

Went for a weekend away for my Dad's 60th Birthday.  Also went with my one year old.  We arrived early and thought would see if our rooms were early which they were.  They set my daughters cot up for me.  The hotel is very central.  The breakfast was amazing although my parents would have preferred unseasoned sausages.  Loved the waffle maker!!  
We would not stay anywhere else if we visit Bristol again."
2321,519GregS,2012-12-31,3.0,"Another case of Hilton diluting their brand quality Nothing wrong with the hotel itself, rooms are very nice, everywhere is clean, tidy and new. Parking is something like 10GBP so park on the street round the corner for free after hours. Problems arise when you go to the bar. We were charged 11.90gbp for 3 soft drinks, complained and were given free drinks to compensate but not before being told that 'hotel bars are expensive'...thanks for that. Management, grow up with your bar pricing, you're clearly hoping punters won't make a fuss, then you will have an excellent hotel."

They were polite, extremely helpful, courteous and very pleasant. The food was superb and we were made to feel like we were staying with friends. The parking is excellent and good value at £10 a night. A large shopping centre is a 10 minute walk away and a taxi to the Hippodrome cost us £5 each way which was very reasonable. We would definitely stay here again. There is a 24 hour snack section with microwave meals and drinks. The bar food is very good and reasonably priced. Park view rooms are worth a few pounds extra. The breakfast is varied, fresh fish available which I always enjoy, the waffle iron is Worth a try and staff are happy to show you how to use it."

We have not been disappointed on our stays. Very clean rooms. Lovely Serta beds (would like to buy one for ourselves if someone would tell me were to buy?) had a great nights sleep. 
Everything you need for your breakfast too. Many thanks to the staff we met for their help.
 Far better than some of the closer hotels in this area. 
Stayed before Christmas and again January
Will be back.....:)"
2327,575Booboo575,2013-01-31,4.0,"I really liked this hotel.... Stayed here for my 30th birthday and wasn't disappointed with the hotel.it was smart,very clean and the best feature was the imac apple laptop which was also a tv.This came in very useful as there was a radio too.staff very friendly and helpful.Only down fall was its about a 20-25 min walk to the pubs,clubs and some restaurants,although there were some nearer by too  but the harbourside was a good 25 min walk and when the weather is cold,this isnt good but its not an im possible walk and we paid £6 for a taxi to the habourside and the highest someone tried to charge us was £30 back, this was over-priced and we eventually got a taxi for £8 back.
Bristol is a very historical city and has many restaurants but I did not like the night life much.Oceana did not seem to have a good atmosphere.Pitcher and piano was nice to have a few quiet drinks and the weatherspoons by the habourside was very cheap of-course but I felt the night life wasn't good.The kebabs were very nice though and generous amounts given too.If I was to go to Bristol again,I would make sure I planned it out better as it is very easy to get lost.I would definitely stay in this hotel again but I wouldn't go to Bristol again,although I had an amazing time still.There is a £10 charge for parking too and we were allowed to check in almost 2.5 hrs early too."

Lovely modern bathroom with mini cosmetics from Neutrogena - always good! Had breakfast on the first morning - excellent and one meal in the bar - also good.

The hotel is just 7-10 minute walk into Cabots Circus (fantastic shopping mall).
The breakfast was delicious..
We had a slight problem with the breakfast one day, but Olpie at the Reception dealt with the matter instantly and were shocked at the amazing service received...thank-you!!
I have knocked off one star as the room sizes are pretty small and feels slightly claustrophobic after a while. We asked if we could have a room with a bath tub, but none of the rooms had a bath tub. 

Overall, had a lovely stay! Thank-you!"
2332,Garry87,2013-01-31,4.0,"An excellent place... Only one flaw, but a key point. Decided to stay here for one night as we found a good deal through trivago (Queen Evolution room with park view for £53!) and even though I completely forgot to put the postcode into my GPS, I wouldn't have needed to anyway as its location is off the main route past Cabot circus and you can't miss it. 

Check in was fast and the staff were very kind, you are even allowed to order takeaway and get it sent to your room with no noses turned up. 

Room was large, clean, good selection of neutrogena products and my favourite... A power shower, always the perfect start to the day. Unfortunately both me and the person I was with said the same thing, the room was hot and the bed wasn't overly comfortable so it wasn't the best night sleep. Nevertheless the room came with a 22"" iMac with JBL speakers and sub, tea and coffee, safe, minibar and an ice bucket depending on what you might be there for ;)

I would probably stay here again for the value as its a prime location for a weekend shopping."

The room was clean and functional, all we needed for a night's stay! There was an empty fridge to store drinks etc. Breakfast was great, with bucks fizz available to toast the new year! I enjoyed fresh fruit and a full english breakfast, with good quality sausage and bacon. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend for a stay in the city. Also brilliant location 5 mins from train station and 10-15 mins walk to shops! Beds and pillows were so comfy!"

The room (twin) was lovely, again very clean and very well equipped - I was particulalry impressed with the apple tv!!  Bathroom very smart and clean with a good powerful shower and lovely large fluffy white bath towels.  We were pleasantly surprised that due to it being new year, breakfast had been extended to 1pm and checkout to 2pm which was great.

I booked a double for sole room for my friend who is going to visit England in the coming Jan on Booking.com. Picked the advance purchase rate which is quite good offer, unfortunately I made a little mistake of the booking- was supposed to choose the double bed room/not a twin beds room. The prices of both room types are exactly the same on Booking.com. Due to it's a booking based on advance purchase rate, I can’t amend it under my account myself. Reasonably, I thought I could ring the hotel directly to ask this little tiny favour. However, the girl (India Accent) in front desk kept persuades me to ring Booking.com directly and then she just hanged up the phone without waiting for me to finish the conversation!!!!!! How a staff under HILTON brand can do things like that?!!!!! I have been traveling a lot and stayed in all sort of hotels and never met experience like that, plus that was a tiny favour! I didn’t expect to cancel the booking!! I tired to ring back again and spoke to a girl in the reservation the second time, luckily not all the staffs are  with non-customer service sense. She kindly sorted all the problems for me and sent me another booking confirmation letter! What I would like to say is, if you really want to provide guests a good stay, please watch how your staff talk to us, please!! I made the first phone call at around 8:20pm , 27th Dec 2012."
2340,NiclasAa,2012-12-31,4.0,"Good value hotel Went to Bristol for a Christmas shopping weekend and had booked a stay at this hotel since it was close to the Bristol Temple Meads Railway Station and what else we might need during the weekend. It did turn out that the area around the hotel has several budget chain hotels, office buildings and university buildings. Not the most exciting area during the weekend. But luckily the city centre and old town as well as several malls and Christmas markets were within fair walking distance from the hotel.

The hotel itself was quite nice and very well lit. We felt very welcome upon entering the hotel and had no problems finding our way. Our room was on the 4th floor and although it was quite small, with a small bathroom as well, we got by quite well during our stay.

It was nice to have free Wi-Fi and even an iMac which didn't just serve as the rooms TV and radio but also made it possible to surf the web and even watch movies on Netflix. Nice.

The room also had a small fridge, perfect for keeping our store bought breakfast items and drinks cold.

We found the room clean and the surroundings were fairly quiet. The view from our room was also pretty nice as well.

We had a nice time at this hotel, and in the city, and would consider staying here again in the future."

2344,hungryweegielass,2012-11-30,4.0,"Fantastic, great staff! I was in Bristol at the end of November for a job interview, having never been before. I arrived at the hotel at around 8pm, and the night manager was incredibly helpful. My interview was in a rather obscure location, so she helped by pointing out were it was and sorting out a taxi for the next day. My mother came with me for shopping and the night manager kindly marked out some good sights and shops for my mum to visit whilst I was at the interview.

We then asked for a good restaurant recommendation - and we were sent to a beautiful Italian 5 minutes away.

The room was lovely, it was good to have use of the Mac as a computer particularly before interview. It was a little small perhaps, and there was no bath, but this hotel is such great value for money. The bed I thought was comfy, but can see here than a few have remarked it was uncomfortable.

Ate in the bar for lunch after my interview and it was very nice, if a little overpriced, but it is a hotel bar - no surprises there.

All in all, I enjoyed my stay and was impressed by the price, good location and most of all the helpful and friendly manner of the staff."

Parking spaces were almost as small as the bathroom and cost £10 for 24 hrs but on the positive they are right outside the hotel. Would I stay here again? Without question on the same rate."

2351,LesleyMcA,2012-12-31,5.0,"Excellent accommodation and customer service I stayed for two nights, Friday and Saturday.  The staff offer fantastic customer service, the rooms are small but very well equipped with large screen Apple Macs in every room and free internet and wifi connection.  My room  was very clean and tripple glazed and I wasn't disturbed by noise from outside at any time.  It is convenient to fabulous restaurants but my surprise was the standard of food being served in the hotel.  I had breakfast, served with a smile from all the waiting staff and a bar snack which was more excellent than a 5 star ""gaff"" I stayed in a few weeks ago.  The Christmas dinner menu looked like fantastic value at £15.00 for two or three courses and I can recommend the festive pudding - delicious.  I will definitely stay in the hotel again and would miss the opportunity the next time of dining there too.  If you are big on customer service and a ""foodie"" like me then you will not be disappointed with this hotel."
2352,flightqueen,2012-12-31,5.0,"Super stay My daughter booked this hotel for a birthday stay away.  Great location as its easy walking distance to all the excellent shopping venues in the city and close to the harbour side for dining in the evening.  Couldn't fault the hotel everything we wanted and more.  Parking right outside the door, easy check in and good size room with lots of extras including Apple TV with computer facilities for free.  Breakfast was of a very good standard and freshly cooked selection until 11am. Most of all this establishment should be so proud of their staff as everyone was so polite and helpful and they smile!!  Top marks must go to Mark on reception, when checking in my daughter mentioned it was a birthday celebration trip and he promptly organised a special delivery to the room from the hotel.. Bottle of chilled wine and chocolate bars, what a lovely surprise when I opened the door!!  Mark also spend some considerable time explaining the different venues near the harbour side and the best way to get to them providing us with a map also.  This won't be the last time we stay here we had what can only be described as a super stay."
2353,freerthanyou,2012-11-30,4.0,"Pleasant Stay Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and used it as a base for exploring Bath and shopping in Bristol. The hotel is in a very convenient location - 5-10 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads station and a 10 minute walk from Cabot circus shopping.
We weren't able to check in early due to a shortage of linen (!) but we were able to leave our bags. When we returned later in the afternoon there were fresh cookies available, the staff were welcoming and they recognised that it was my mother's birthday and sent 2 glasses of prosecco to out room which we were very pleased with.
Breakfast was a bit disorganised, no chamomile tea available and a limited selection of cold breakfast options. They kept running out of bowls and plates too but the staff were helpful and apologetic. 
We slept very well and would recommend staying at this hotel. Very convenient for exploring Bath which is 15-20 minutes away on the train and close to the shops as well. Free wifi and a Mac in each room is a nice bonus!"
2354,LinkPady,2012-11-30,5.0,"Excellent service and breakfast I stayed in the Hiton Garden Inn for a weekend and I would highly recommend this hotel. The rooms were very clean and it was really useful having the iMac. The Neutrogena toiletries were a lovely touch. The bed was very comfortable and was raised off the ground which was handy to store unsightly suitcases underneath. The staff were very kind and helpful. The breakfast was excellent, there was a large variety of breakfast food on offer from fresh fruit to a full cooked breakfast. The highlight for me was the waffle maker and chocolate on top. Location wise the hotel was conveniently located near the train station and it was a short walk to the city centre (under 10 minutes)."
2355,BrianE849,2012-12-31,4.0,"Very nice ( But) Stayed two nights.Room slightly small and no bath,only shower.Room very clean and well fitted out.Nice to have a safe and fridge.Breakfast was very good ,buffet style,wide selection and fresh and well cooked. Staff friendly and helpful.Now for my but.You will be charged £10 per day to park in the hotel car park.WHY. I cannot see any justification for this other than to prise another £10 out of guests unfortunate to have to drive. Also the car park spaces are so small after I had parked I couldn't open my door wide enough to get out."
2356,tricias99,2012-12-31,5.0,"Excellent hotel in great location we stayed on the 1st December with friends as visiting their son at Uni in Bath. Couldnt find anywhere in Bath as all booked up so plumped for this place. What a great find. Minutes from Temple meads station, shopping, Weatherspoons and drinking places. The hotel was clean in all communal areas, rooms were brilliant and quiet even with main road below. Beds very comfortable. Breakfast with plenty of choice and attentive staff. All in all great hotel, location. Polite, friendly staff. Will definately stay again."
2357,834julieB,2012-12-31,5.0,"Excellent value We stayed on the Wine and Dine Offer, which was excellent value.  The rooms are very clean as well as all other areas of the hotel.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The 3 course evening meal was very good and again served by very friendly and efficient staff.  Breakfast was very busy although the food was good, the only critisism I have is that the toaster was very slow, which seemed strange as everything else in the hotel was excellent."
2358,Jean0001,2012-11-30,4.0,"Great hotel in a great location Stayed for 4 nights whilst visiting relations. Got a really good deal in 50% off sale. (£64 per room including breakfast for myself and my husband). Asked for quiet room, was on top(5th) floor looking over churchyard, brilliant. En suite shower room (no bath) was a bit small, but it had everything that you required and loads of hot water from the shower. The room was clean had everything you needed, hairdryer, iron, ironing board, alarm, tv, tea/coffe facilities. As a previous guest said the bed was firm, but l had a good nights sleep and no aching back so l can't complain. There were a few marks on carpet and walls from previous guests but nothing too bad.
The staff were all helpful, and the breakfasts good, especially the sausages, they were the best l've ever had (I wish l had asked where they got them from), Only ate in the hotel one evening and it was a good 3 course meal for £20.
We went by train and it is really convienient for the station, especially as we went on the train to Bath for the Christmas markets. Also not too far to walk to all the other attractions in Bristol. Would definitely recommend and if we go to Bristol again we will definitely stay at this hotel again."
2359,Wessexgirl68,2012-11-30,4.0,"Nice clean accomodation Pleasnt reception staff, light airy comfortable rooms. The bed was very firm and built for giants, as I needed a running jump to get up on it. The bedding was spotless and the pillows the best yet.
I really liked the Nutrogena complimentary products provided, down to the flannel I forgot to bring
On the street side but with triple glazed windows I didnt hear a thing.
Everything was clean and new, I guess there has been a refurb in the last year or so.
The only worrying thing was returning to the hotel after a course I was in the bar and purchased with a colleague some overpriced drinks. These were bought and paid for in cash and when we left the bar and travelled down the corridor towards our rooms on the second floor we were chased by a member of staff as he thought we had left without paying our bar bill.... strange as I would have thought if we were on a tab a room number would have been taken? I mean do we look the sort???
Breakfast the next morning was a sort of serve yourself, as in there was a waiter poised with coffee for top ups, but he seemed to ignore us ladies and only applied himself to older businessmen...perhaps they tip better as we certainly didnt when faced with being ignored!
I also must say the cleaning staff were lovely, I let them know my room was vacant when I left and the housekeeper went out of her way to hold the door open for me and my bags
It was definately a case of the female staff were lovely but the male staff had a lot to learn
Room service was strange as you chose and heat up your own food from a sort of minimart in the reception area as far as I could tell - not tested"
2360,Locallady,2012-11-30,5.0,"Totally recommended. I visited this weekend with 3 friends for their first visit to Bristol. I chose the hotel for it's proximity to Cabot Circus and the town centre. Having previously stayed in other (more expensive ) hotels in the area, the Hilton had by far the highest standards of house-keeping. The cleaning staff were all very friendly and chirpy, the reception staff were professional and very helpful (especially Opie) We were a little disappointed that there was only a Christmas menu available in the restaurant on Sunday night, but the waitress very helpfully suggested another restaurant off site. The parking is a bit expensive at £10 a day but city centre car parking would have cost a lot more, so I am not complaining. I found the bed a little too firm but my friends all thought they were very comfortable so each to their own! We liked the mac in the room, a useful touch if you are travelling without a laptop. Despite the proximity to a busy road there was very little noise. This hotel really does offer everything you need at a very reasonable price. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending it. Well done !"
2361,Timsuv,2012-11-30,4.0,"Perfectly functional with nice staff...it's what you need! We just needed an overnight stay to go and see Ben Folds Five; the best band in the world. We were only going to sleep there so we wanted clean (done), quiet (asked for a top floor room and was accommodated along with being put away from the lift shaft - which would have been a problem), affordable (£68 for the room and two breakfasts) and a good breakfast (come on! It was everything you need and they would do anything you want. You could even cook your own eggs just they way you like them...hard to fault that).
If you want a luxury break with frills don't come here. But if you want efficiency and all the above in the heart of a brilliant city like Bristol, look no further."
2362,jandono,2012-11-30,4.0,"Nice Hotel but if you don't like very firm beds - hard - then don't book! The hotel was in a good position and had everything you would need. Reception was not particularly helpful or friendly. Parking is £10 per day so not cheap but essential. Breakfast service was not good. Was asked if I would like tea or coffee but got neither anyway! The worst thing for me was the bed in the room. It is VERY firm. Great if you like that but I could not sleep at all and my limbs kept going numb with the pressure meaning I would wake up if I did drift off! I found the same at their Glasgow hotel and now will not stay at Hilton Gardens. I cannot as it is usually for work and I need to sleep. Come on guys, tempura tops???"
2363,Traveller027,2012-11-30,3.0,"Hilton I don't think so ! Small reception area - staff are nice. Room clean. Room small - box like with box like features. If i had wanted the Ibis or A Premier Inn I would have booked one. TV is a MAC - good as in amusing - poor as in that's not what I want - I look at computers 8 hours a day !
Toilet immaculately clean - but small - Oh no bath a shower - small small small but clean.
Bar staff and bar food nice - above average in quality - and in price. Breakfast yes breakfast. Standard buffet - but alas you can order fresh cooked food too ! Fantastic - except I waited 15 mins - staff were to busy or not present - so I could not try the kippers - I gave up. Nice try but under staffed  - Alas won't be back."
2364,MandMStAlbans,2012-11-30,5.0,"Does what it says on the tin! I just hate nit-picky reviews that do not reflect the class of hotel or the price paid.  Yes the bathroom was on the small side but perfectly adequate for a typical short stay City break.  We chose the hotel based on location (Strawbs gig at the Exchange) and on price - it being just a one night stay. The room was clean, well furnished with a good sized bed and an Apple TV/Computer. Everything worked well and the breakfast could not be faulted on choice or quality."
2365,MrJohnAS,2012-11-30,5.0,"Best hotel I've stayed in Bristol I was booked into the Hilton on a recent business trip in November 2012 and I have to say my stay was fantastic. The hotel was extremely clean and well served with polite, friendly staff. The room had a very comfortable bed and the addition of the Apple IMac in the room was very helpful for getting some emails sent, checking the web and also watching TV.

My only complaint would be the meal selection was a little limited so we ended up eating out but this proved to be a bonus as we found a fantastic Inidian restaurant near by.

I would be more than happy to be booked back into the Hilton in the future.

Please be aware that parking is £10 for the night extra"
2366,Boxers_Parents,2012-11-30,4.0,"Great value and Quality Accomodation in Bristol We have just returned from a weekend break in Bristol and can only speak highly of this hotel.

We booked a room only rate (£66 per room per night advance payment) and were offered at check-in breakfast for £15 for two people that was significantly cheaper than the advertised rate of £13.95 per person so bare this offer in mind if breakfast is for you!

In terms of food we had room service on the first night as we arrived late (good standard burger was £12 plus £4 surcharge room delivery) and the other we came across a wetherspoons pub situated on Temple Quay when walking from the train station to the hotel that took less than 10 minutes to achieve. Temple Quay also had a Starbucks, Cafe and Newsagents so all in all the hotel was in a great location for everything you would need for a weekend stay.

We would have no hesitation at all staying here or recommending this hotel to you"
2367,Beatlands,2012-11-30,3.0,"Surprisingly pleased! City centre and noisy.  Very noisy.  Air con not efficient so felt like I was suffocating with windows closed or deafened with them open (albeit by about only 20mm).  But, hotel rather nice.  Stayed here before when it was City Hotel then Mint Hotel but this was the best visit.  Nice room with lovely toiletries - yes. I'm a woman....  Also liked the adjustable chair which made working at desk with laptop comfortable, not to mention the very comfy bed.  Was not impressed by the singer in the bar (too noisy) but the waitress was a hoot and the food was lovely, but pricey.  Would stay again."
2368,dazmo99,2012-11-30,3.0,"Nice welcome shame about the food and drink. I stayed here with a work colleague on a Sunday night before a Monday meeting.  First impressions of this hotel were great, the welcome was warm and friendly by a very nice and helpfull receptionist who assisted us with directions to our meeting the next day.  Room was great, clean and very comfortable with excellent fascilities.  Sadly it all went downhill from there.  The bar had 4 draft beers, none of which were available.  To make matters worse, the 2 bottled beers available were not refrigerated and hugely overpriced at nearly £9 for 2 warm beers!  Restaurant staff were surly and unlike other dinners, didn't think that we warranted any communication throuout our meal, not so much as a ""is your meal ok""?  Proably best as it wasn't great, overcooked and overpriced.  Overall, this hotel let the Hilton brand down.
Wont be staying here again when there is a lovely Novotel around the corner."
2369,Snoish,2012-11-30,2.0,"Overpriced and understocked Stayed here one night for business.

Room was ok, comparable to any Hilton chain room, although it lacked complementary water.

Receptionist was lovely and helpful, unlike the waiting staff in the restaurant who were surly and uncommunicative.

At the time of stay the hotel had no alcohol on draught, and some of the bottled beer was only available warm (why they couldn't place it in the fridge I cannot understand).

Food was expensive and portions small in the restaurant, with any nice touches being charged as extras.

Overall, I would have a difficult time recommending this hotel."
2370,alanorourke1969,2012-11-30,4.0,"Favourite Bristol Hotel I've been travelling to Bristol for years and this is my favourite.
Great location close to railway and town.
Great compact rooms with the only hotel to provide an Apple computer.
And the breakfast is great with additional options like fish.
Love it."
2371,IMAFusspot,2012-11-30,3.0,"Average The hotel is an easy walk from the railway station and is pleasant.  The Macs in the rooms are excellent and, although rooms are small, they have all the facilities you would expect and are comfortable and reasonable value, especially if they include free WIFI.  Unfortunately, in common with an increasing number of Hiltons I've stayed in lately, where the Garden Inn falls down is staff complacency. They don't have to try too hard - and they don't.  The reception staff didn't engage in any conversation when I arrived; they didn't ask about newspapers, say where the restaurant was, mention breakfast hours, or say that guests had to collect water from a refrigerator in reception.  In fact the only thing they did ask was whether I had parked in the hotel car park.  I had to find out everything else myself.  Being employed in customer care I could have done better! The restaurant was full in the evening but the bar was offered as an alternative.  The 'salad' advertised with the meal turned out to be a small portion of lettuce. Breakfast was average, with smaller selection available than many other Hiltons, although you could order poached eggs, porridge etc.  I was surprised that you had even had to order a fried egg. The dining room had food on the floor, which wasn't swept up, and the serving spoons were all completely cloyed with mixed beans, egg etc - not appetising! - and this was over an hour before the end of the breakfast period. A bin was situated by the serving area. There was no tea or coffee offered and only an occasional glimpse of waiting staff.  More than one person had to ask for a drink before someone came to serve and when some staff did appear they seemed more interested in spritzing the tables.  Again, when I left, I was asked if I had used the car park, but I wasn't asked if I had enjoyed my stay.  I asked if it was possible to have an itemised restaurant bill but received no reply and no itemised bill. Unlikely to stay here again as there are plenty of other hotels in Bristol."
2372,GerryJ706,2012-11-30,4.0,"CBI Annual Dinner I have stayed at this hotel many times when it was The City Inn and The Mint Hotel. As part of the Hilton chain it offers the great food standard and staff of the City,with the easy booking and benefits of the Hilton Group. I was attending a dinner at the Old Brunel Station,so I was able to park my car and walk there. The rooms are modern and very clean but they need a wide screen TV as the Apple Mac's are a bit dated. The location is great with a 5 minute walk to the Centre of Bristol. The Breakfast had a good selection for all tastes. I look forward to my next stay."
2373,pantagruelParis,2012-11-30,4.0,Some nice touches Given how overpriced British hotels generally are there is much to applaud here. Positive aspects include multimedia Macs in rooms (TV and Internet) free wifi everywhere. Breakfast is excellent and varied. Temple Meads station is a short walk aqway. Staff are friendly. A minibar might have been nice. But no real complaints.

The beds are nice and comfy and the room is spacious. The bathrooms have all the items you may need (shampoo, conditioner, sewing kit, shower cap....) .
The breakfast room is nice and you don't feel rushed at all, there is plenty of choice and the breakfast staff are fantastic, they can't do enough for you.
Brilliant hotel for business or leisure. I will go back!"

The room was equipped with an i-mac instead of a TV, the sound quality is poor and it kept freezing up.  Parking is £10 per night seems to be about average for Bristol but is very limited and was full from about 2pm on sat."
2377,Smilerman1,2012-11-30,5.0,one of the best city center hotels in the UK i have regular business in bristol and was booked in last night to this Hotel. After a horrible train journey i was very late arriving. The receptionist arranged refreshments despite the restaurant and bar being closed. The room was excellent and the in room imac very convenient. I wish all other value business hotels were as good. Strongly  approved
2378,Panowizard,2012-10-31,4.0,"Clean and convenient hotel within walking of train station I have had good success with the Hilton Garden chain in the UK and this did not disappoint.  The rooms are very clean and well furnished.  Free WiFi and an iMac in the room is a nice touch.

I had a room with breakfast included and found it to be a good value and while it was crowded in the morning I had no trouble getting enough food and getting served coffee and tea.

This hotel is convenient to the train station though it is a little further from the 'center' of town than some other possible choices.  We were still able to walk to the center and to the University within 20-30 min. and the hotel is by no means isolated.

If I had one gripe it was that the elevators did not work the day we left and we had to climb down several flights with luggage.  There didn't seem to be any urgency in getting it repaired."
2379,151DavidC151,2012-10-31,4.0,"Modern well equiped larger hotel We stopped here for one night and were pleased with the hotel and the general decor. The staff were polite and helpful and there was a host of facilities which we never got time to use in our short stay.

Our room was small but very well equipped and we were very impressed with the iMac computer/TV! The shower did seem to have a bit of a mind of it's own but the shower room was very well equipped - certainly a cut above your usual 'budget' hotel chains.

Probably better suited to 20/30's crowd as there was a lot of noise on the Saturday night into the early hours when we returned to the hotel from a night out.

The hotel is a little way out of the town centre, if you are intending on a night out I would suggest that you will need a taxi of which there are plenty in the area."
2380,leesons2002,2012-10-31,4.0,"May be coming off the boil Since I last stayed here, and wrote a rave review, I stayed here again and there are signs of slippage. I think the hotel is now fuller than it has been during the week and this might be contributing to a slight lowering of standards. The reception staff are still superb and among the best I have encountered. The evening restaurant staff are even better - really attentive, friendly and not intrusive. The evening menu is now looking tired but is still excellent value by hotel standards. Breakfast was hectic and the tables not cleaned which took the edge of an otherwise excellent stay."
2381,kavaqc,2012-10-31,5.0,Great central location Well located with access to all the central areas of Bristol. Easy check in and great breakfast. Well equiped rooms and fast free internet access. Would definately choose this hotel again. Car parking provided and was wasy to use.

2383,Gavin4444,2012-10-31,5.0,"Weekend Break with Friends Stayed here with friends for a weekend break. The place was clean and lively with a fantastic food and drinks menu. The food was presented extremely well and was off the highest quality and tasted great...I get the feeling the chef's have some degree of free reign on the menu and its shows! They also make all their own bread in house which was great. All the Staff were fantastic, extremely professional but also on the same level as the guests at all times meaning a bit of light hearted banter was had! The bartender was highly knowledgeable about the wine selection and all the restaurant staff were very attentive. With reagrds to the rooms, alll of us agreed that they were modern, clean and extremely comfortable (and all include an I Mac computer which is a novelty idea) We all faced the back of the property which over looked a stunning park and avenue with an old Norman church ruins. The proximity of the hotel to the city centre is great meanig that it is a 10 min walk to most areas and bars and 5 mins from the ,main train station. Overall, this was a great stay with great staff and great value for money."

2385,Susie64,2012-10-31,5.0,"Wonderful staff, spotless room, comfy bed & great breakfast! Just returned from another wonderful weekend in Bristol. HIlton Garden is situated in walking distance of the centre. Rooms are clean with tea & coffee facilities, comfy bed, free safe, bathroom with all essentials! Particularly impressed with the staff here as it was my sister's 40th birthday and being a large group of couples they still made us all feel extremely welcome and made her weekend one to remember. Breakfast was particularly good as not only a good English breakfast (yes there are beans!) but good selection of fruit and the best part for me, the waffle maker and the addition of maple syrup or chocolate sauce (don't think about the calories at breakfast, you can't miss out!). The staff here are really hard working and actually seemed to enjoy looking after us! Car parking is at hotel £10 but was full so behind hotel is a pay and display 4 hours stay £4 which you only need pay until 6 p.m. and then revisit in the morning. Check out was 11 and ok to check out and then go for breakfast. Have a little walk through the church yard and stop for a drink at the King's Head a wonderful bit of our English history! Will be back again. Thank you to all the staff and spoiling us all."
2386,MalletsMallet,2012-09-30,4.0,"Very nice I stayed here for a business trip. It seems to be a very business-orientated hotel. Nice, friendly staff. Room was nice, if a bit small, but no worse than I expected. My room overlooked a busy road but there was no noise to speak of. Bathroom only had a shower - no bath. Doesn't bother me though. Rooms all have iMacs so you can watch TV, listen to radio, watch DVDs, use the interweb all on the one machine. Good signal strength on the free WiFi too. Had a drink in the bar which was nice enough but didn't eat there. Maybe next time."

2389,Paul1005,2012-10-31,4.0,"Great location with great amenities After searching the Internet for cheap but quality hotels in the Bristol / Bath area for a weekend away I was pleasantly surprised to find the 4 star Hilton in Bristol virtually the cheapest around, beating many 2 star hotels.

Upon arrival I was disappointed with the tiny car park. It has maybe 25 spaces for a 175 room hotel. To make matters worse the spaces are incredibly small and really tight to get in. If you have a large car I would avoid the hotel car park and look for an alternate place to leave your car. 

The hotel is easy to find by car, and 5-10 minutes walk from the main shopping quarter. There are also plenty of chain restaurants or bars nearby.

However after checking in and getting into our room we were pleasantly surprised. The room was not the biggest but more than functional. The furniture was solid and well made but the jewel in the crown was the iMac computer which doubles as the TV, radio and CD player. Of course you could also use it as a computer and there is free Internet access, both on the mac and wifi in the room. Not the fastest in the world but still free.

The bathroom again was slightly on the small side but easily comfortable with a decent shower (no bath).

Our room was facing a main room, and we had absolutely no trouble with any noise.

We would have no hesitation on staying at the Hilton Bristol again. £89 (inc parking) for a 4 star hotel is a bargin."
2390,MartinCrothall,2012-10-31,3.0,"Not what it used to be I've stayed here before, when it was MINT Hotel and was very satisfied. Unfortunately since it's been taken over by Hilton, it's lost that feeling of somewhere different. The rooms are now feeling corporate and dated. 

Comfortable bed and the location is as good as ever, but I'll be looking for somewhere else next time I stay in Bristol."
2391,VenkatWorld,2012-09-30,4.0,"Nice place Stayed here for 9 days in Sept 2012. Must say that location is very good with easy access to most of the places. I stayed on a room facing the park(at the backside) and it was very calm and quiet. I am not sure about the front facing rooms as they overlook the road, but looks like almost all rooms are acoustically sealed :) 

The rooms are a tad smaller than the ones that i stayed in the neigbouring Novotel, but it was VERY clean and service was good. Also, since there was no complimentary breakfast, it helped me in choosing me what i wanted to eat on a daily basis than eating the same menu all throughout my stay. 

The gym was a little smaller than what i would have expected; but nevertheless it has all the basic equipments. Would have better if there was a sauna or a swimming pool :)"

Rooms are still very good with nice selection of toiletries and the Mac's with free wifi are still there - which is great! Room service was good value and arrived very quickly - omelette chips and salad for £8.95. Staff all friendly. Breakfast waiting staff were great - I felt the quality of ingredients really let it down - tinned pineapple and weak coffee. Will return!"
2393,KarenH139,2012-09-30,5.0,"""Excellent location very helful and polite staff"" My friends and I have just  spent the weekend in Bristol.Despite the breakfast area being jammed pack both mornings,  the staff stayed really calm,  helpful and apologetic.Its in a great position for the town center and also the station.The rooms are really clean and even have ironing boards!!Shower was lovely and hot if a bit diificult to control.
 Really lovely Italian around the corner called the Olive Branch where we had a great meal.
Would definitely stay here again."
2394,Jmkell,2012-09-30,5.0,"Helpful, wonderful staff I was Ill while staying at the hotel and the staff were amazing especially the manager, mark. Helped me get seen by a doctor, looked after me, brought tea and juice to my room. just brilliant customer service. Can't thank them enough."
2395,jacquelineht93,2012-09-30,4.0,"Fabulous! Me and my boyfriend have just come back from a weekend staying in this hotel, we could not complain about anything. The first thing which we loved about this hotel was the location, we were approximately 5 minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads train station and 5-10 minutes walk from the city centre (Cabotts Circus), if your looking at visiting Bristol docks then we recommend that you get a taxi (approx. £5-£7) the hotels reception did this for us! (Very helpful). Our room was fabulous, the bed was very compfy and the cushions were to die for! Another thing which was great was they had an Apple I Mac which was a TV & Computer, so its ideal if you do not know the area, the hotel soo clean and the hotel staff were all lovely. The breakfest was okay you have a selection from cooked breakfest and continental breakfest and you can help yourself as much as you like, however we did see that if you were to purchase breakfest as an extra it was £14! Which we thought was astonishing for what their was (highly recommend booking a room which includes breakfest). All in all we really enjoyed our stay and would go back again!"
2396,FishermanWales,2012-09-30,4.0,"Ideal hotel for a city break Central location near the railway station makes attractions like the Harbourside, Broadmead Shopping Center and many restaurants and pubs only a short walk away
The rooms, though on the small side, are modern, very clean and comfortable. Rooms are fitted with I Mac computers/telivisions and have free internet acess. Bathrooms are small but well appointed and incorporate a large shower cubical (no horrible plastic shower curtains), an excellent range of shampoos and body lotions are provided.
Parking at the hotel costs £10.00 for 24 hours and local parking meters charge £1.00 an hour (maximum stay 4hours) from 8am to 6pm Monday to Saturday.
Will use again."
2397,Delia274,2012-09-30,5.0,"On Holiday to see Bath, England Stayed at the Holiday Inn Garden Inn in City Centre it was an excellent location to the train station.  I was able to walk to Brisol train station in 10 minutes!  If you are going to see Bath it is 3 stops from the Bristol train station.  The bar staff were very friendly and gave me reviews and recommendations on restaurants and pubs.  I ate the first night at the restaurant in hotel the food was excellent.  The room was very clean, bed very comfortable and I liked the Apple screen to watch movies and TV.  I would highly recommend this hotel for its excellent location and friendly staff."
2398,ContrailsfromNorway,2012-09-30,4.0,"Better than expected I often think that ""Inns"" are boring and nothing more than just a bed, but this one is a good one. As a gold member I was given the service I expect and I also liked the rooms and the breakfast area. Would not hesitate to stay here once more, even they were a bit slow to check us in because of a long line of arriving guests."
2399,gribblewok,2012-09-30,2.0,"A descent into mediocrity This place used to be the MINT Hotel....I wish it still was. The restaurant used to be excellent and there was ample free car parking and the rooms were reasonably priced. My company booked me into this place again and I discovered that it has fallen into the hands of Hilton. Oh dear. To be fair, the staff were very polite and helpful so no criticism of them at all. However, what was an excellent hotel has sunk into expensive mediocrity since Hilton took over. Hilton is a tired brand which runs tired hotels, fails to invest in them, takes too much of your money and delivers very little. The walls are marked, the carpets stained by what looks like bleach.

Check in took far too long (as did checkout), the decor looks tired now (it didn't when I stayed here last year when it was the MINT), they charge £10 to park there when it used to be free, the restaurant has changed from an excellent eatery into an expensive and poor quality experience. I ordered pork, apple and black pudding (at £14). It was served on a huge plate but the portion was tiny: 2 mouthfuls, and dry and overcooked at that. It wasn't black pudding, it was white pudding. Hilton serves wine in thimbles, not glasses although they charge as if you've ordered a 250ml glass. Sorry, but I felt seriously ripped off. Breakfast is the usual cereal and full English: boring, boring, boring (and expensive). For £14 I'd expect some imagination and variety. You'd get better value from a Premier Inn, and for a lot less money than I had to pay.

The rooms are small: no change there, but they are now far too expensive. The Hotel du Vin is not far away, not much more expensive and infinitely better. Hiltons always disappoint me. I won't be back. I have a choice."
2400,43sherylw,2012-09-30,3.0,"Customer Service Needs Attention We  arrived at the hotel early and first thing we were told there were no rooms ready as they had been full night before.This was fine but we got no smile no greeting, just told we could leave our bags. No information was offered as to when to return so we asked and was told check in was at three but if we came before a room would probably be ready.We came back later to be given our bags not told where the room was and there was someone else checking in at the same time as us, we shared the same lift and the gentleman spoke the same feelings that we had experienced.
The room was lovely large comfortable bed , spotless bathroom,and computer television etc.
Breakfast on the first day was a bit of a sham, putting bacon sausage mushrooms on a plate only to be left standing there waiting for beans and scrambled eggs which had been shouted for a couple of times , in the end I sat down and didnt bother.
Next morning was an even bigger sham, it was very busy admitted but again there was no one frying the eggs so my husband didnt bother, people were chasing the staff round asking for glasses for juice, asking for milk as the milk had run out, asking for coffee as the coffee had run out, and looking for additional cutlery.Not a very relaxing breakfast.
All in all the location was ok about ten minutes walk to the bars on the waterside.The room was great but there was no feeling to the hotel at all."
2401,Coldplayer42,2012-09-30,5.0,"Didn't want to leave!.... After deciding stay in Bristol for a weekend getaway, we opted to stay in the Hilton Garden Inn due to its close proximity to the train station and city centre shopping. 
We arrived earlier than the stated 3pm check in time, but were pleased to discover that our room was ready and we could check in straight away, which saved us leaving our bags behind and returning later on in the afternoon. Our room was on the second floor facing the busy road at the front; however once you got into the room there was no traffic noise at all which I think is down to the thickness of the glazing on the windows. 
The room itself was very clean, and has a modern feel to it. I felt maybe it was a little cluttered with furniture (mainly because of a large chair next to the bed and desk) but this is only a minor criticism. The bed also dominates the room, as it is so large- if you’re short like me you need a step ladder to climb into it! However, the bed is so comfortable; I slept like a log every night. 
A huge bonus was that there was a Mac computer in the room, which doubles up as the T.V, but there is free internet and Wi-Fi access which I think is great. I have never come across a computer in the actual bedroom before and I have to say, I was VERY impressed by this facility. 
The bathroom was also spotlessly clean, with a fab shower with the option of changing the water pressure from the shower head i.e. Jet, rain champagne etc which I think is a nice touch and was pleased to discovered that the complimentary toiletries are by Neutrogena (not the usual non branded variety that smell of Toilet Duck!) 
Now onto the breakfast...again very impressed! A great choice including continental (cereals, pastries and fruit) and a full English option of sausages, bacon etc. You could even order things from the kitchen, such as omelettes, vegetarian sausages etc. There was also a waffle iron to make your own sweet waffles with chocolate and Forrest fruits toppings...I’ve got to say I made a right pig of myself at breakfast, but everything was just so tasty!! 
I loved my stay at this hotel and have absolutely nothing negative to say about it. Consequently I have no qualms about recommending it to anybody; it goes without saying that I would visit this hotel again in a heartbeat."
2402,Mont1e,2012-08-31,4.0,"Decent business hotel I stayed here for 2 nights.  The room is comfortable and well insulated.  You get an I-Mac as your TV, which also means you get a computer and free internet access, which is a nice difference.  Breakfast is nice, and the staff are very attentive.  The restaurant is OK in the evening, but a bit pricey."
2403,sun_city_girl84,2012-08-31,5.0,"Great Bargain. Got a summer sale room on impulse only paid £42 which was the biggest bargain going! Loved the hotel; clean, modern, comfortable rooms. The bed was amazing and the pillows were the best (I took the pillowcase off to look for a label to see where they were from so I could go and get one but couldnt find a label!), the bathroom was also great; big shower, good shower and nice neutragena products.
The imac in the room was great.
The parking was £10 for 24 hours which is really cheap.
Also the reception staff were very helpful and friendly."

If you like modern, well run hotels that you can truly relax in then this is the one to pick."
2406,hoopsHarwich,2012-08-31,4.0,"Very nice hotel and location We stayed here accidentally as were moved from the Novotel Bristol (see my review), but it did not stop us enjoying this hotel. It is clean, with friendly staff, and 10 min walk from the riverside bars and eateries - or the city centre shops. We came by car, but it is also only a short walk from Templemeads train station.

We particularly liked the free internet and I-Mac in our room. The breakfast was standard hot and cold buffet but certainly not worth paying what they were charging - we got this as part of the deal free because of being moved on from the Novotel.

All in all it was a nice place to stay, although if we had been paying full price would have not been our first choice."
2407,happysb,2012-08-31,5.0,"Great hotel in a good location We went for a stag weekend on August bank holiday and really enjoyed our stay.  Rooms were clean and refreshed well each morning, fixtures and fittings were of high quality, there was free WiFi, and the iMac entertainment system incorporating Sky Sports/free internet/JBL speaker system was a great addition.  Noise was pretty well suppressed except for when the window was open as the hotel is fronted by a busy main road.  The bathroom and shower were clean albeit a little on the small side.

The only negatives were that the hotel was a slight walk from the city centre (only 5-10 minutes though) and parking was a little dear at £20 for two nights.  There is a private car park close by but they don't do preferential rates for hotel users and it would be a bit of a nuisance to go back and forth to add tickets.

Even then, I don't think these little niggles are enough to prevent me rating the Hilton Garden Inn in Bristol as excellent and would highly recommend to others wanting to spend some time in Bristol."
2408,KateT222,2012-08-31,5.0,"Rally nice hotel This hotel is lovely. Clean, spacious room in a really good location for Bristols attractions and nightlife. It's only a 5 minute walk from Bristol Temple Mead station and also has a car park for £10 per night, this is on the small side but didn't pose a problem on a bank holiday weekend. The breakfast buffet was nice enough and had a lot of variety. Staff are friendly and extremely helpful and polite. An added bonus as it was my first visit to Bristol was the iMac in the room with free WiFi so great for looking up where to go and what to do."
2409,Hayes32513,2012-08-31,2.0,"Disappointing When I travel I book my hotels based on name brand, location, and value.  This hotel was fair in its rate but lousy in accommodation and delivery.  A travel lodge may have been better.  The halls still have a vague odor of old tobacco use.  It appears the bathrooms were upgraded but didn't do a very good job.  The tap was loose, the toilet slow to flush.  When i called about the toilet one of the desk clerks came up and told me you needed to 'prime it first' then it would be fine.  Well, sometimes it took 4-5 pumps to prime and get it to flush.  Not a problem in a Travel Lodge but at a Hilton????  They also have a squeaky elevator that started waking me up at 6 am every morning on my 3 day stay.  The dining area was not kept up very well and they had a lousy system for serving.  It was not the fault of the worker bee's but I would say restaurant management.  They had one person cooking all 'eggs' to order and a full house.  Hence by the time you waited in line for the egg the rest of your breakfast would be cold.  I would stop doing all eggs to order and only do an omlett bar or have two people cooking the eggs.  Just badly organized.  The last hotel I was at was in Paris where I was a bit spoiled yet paid the same prize.  The Paris hotel has a very high rating by customers.  Hence, I may stay here again for value, but know I know it does not meet Hilton standards in my book."
2410,DennyM124,2012-08-31,5.0,Very nice... The Hilton Garden Inn is located directly in Bristol's city center. It is a 5 minute walk from/to the central train station Temple Meads. If you are traveling by plain there is an airport bus from/to Temple Meads (just google from Bristol airport flyer). We found a very clean room with an iMac as TV and free WiFi all over the place. The stuff was very nice and friendly. On Sundays there was a special breakfast offer which I recommend (15 pounds for full English breakfasts for 2 persons). It is a 10 minute walk to the main shopping area around Cabbot Circus as well as the harbour side or the party areas. So everything can reached easily by foot. I would not hesitate to stay there again.
2411,Planning_trips2222,2012-08-31,4.0,"the word sorry is never used here! on check in i asked for a room facing the garden .  also checked ok to park car where marked out for emergency vechicles. Reply yes thats fine.I was told that she should charge more for rooms on the garden side but would not on this occasion.
Asked for a room swap as given room at fire doors which can be noisy at night. Quickly swapped room.
Agree with other reviews bathroom very small.  room nice, bed very comfortable and liked the mac. Room clean and better than a premier inn which is  other hotel we considered. 
Never got the complimentary  newspaper we ordered on both days as hilton honors members. Excuse on both days why we did not get. Never heard the word sorry.
Car was covered in seagul poo, when went to it after first night stay. Again no apology, i was told  they cannot contol the birds. Try putting spikes on your roof that would stop them. Other guest car was also covered in poo. This was clearly not the first time somebody had complained. They charge you £10 for this service. I said i would not pay and the receptionist agreed to this immediatley. Did i hear that word.....no sorry is not in the vocab at this hotel.
I would recommend this hotel if not using the carpark and paying no more than the premier inn.  Have stayed in nova hotel but as you will see it was some time ago."
2412,MEuropeTravels,2012-08-31,3.0,"Good location.. not much else The location is great if you use the train station daily.  This hotel was not built as a Hilton and it shows in most of the areas. The rooms are not up to Hilton standards in size or features.  There is an ice bucket in the room, but only ice machine is in the lobby.  Don’t be fooled by the breakfast, it’s not worth anywhere near the £15 they charge for it and you can get the same thing for £4 2 minutes away.  On the plus side, the bed is very comfortable and the TV/ iMAC is a cool feature."
2413,781rayw,2012-08-31,5.0,"Ideal location This hotel was booked for £59 per night room only. We were allocated a room on the 5th floor overlooking the park. The room was spotless and was kept clean each day. The room had air conditioning which was needed as it was so hot day and night.

Our stay was for 3 nights which was very enjoyable."

Breakfast is great with lots to choose from and nothing it too much trouble, loved the waffle machine.  Beds are very comfortable, shower nice and roomy and the imacs with tv and free internet access is great as you can look up Trip Advisor while in your room to plan you days /evenings.  Will defo stay here again."
2415,SDLough,2012-07-31,5.0,"Great hotel, convenient location This is a lovely 4* hotel conveniently located close to Temple Meads railstation. Staff friendly and helpful. The room was a good size, the bed was queen size and comfortable and had eveything you could need. Although we had to ask for a remote for the IMac.
The iMac was impressive!! I've not seen this in any other hotel before. This also doubles as the TV. 

The breakfast buffet was good with a chef to cook your eggs however you liked and freshly cooked waffleswaffles. 
The only down side was the toast machine, it was one of those AWFUL machines that takes ages and you have to put your toast in 4 times to get it brown!All in all a great stay though and would recomend this hotel."

Don't think I would stay there if we actually had a hot summer! Great Breakfast service excellent. The rooms are small but spotless."
2417,MissMayB,2012-08-31,4.0,"Bedroom good, Bathroom small! Stayed here because we were going to Bristol International Balloon Fiesta. Got a good room rate as we booked few months in advanced. It was in good location, only 3- 5 minutes walk from the train station which was good for us.

Over all our stay was good and we would stay here again."

The breakfast was nice with a chef to cook your omelette and a small selection of other cooked breakfast choices - all the things you would expect including waffles. 

A late checkout was easily accommodated (for a fee). 

The staff were really helpful and a great asset to this hotel.

There is limited room service available only from 5-10pm which might be restrictive to some if arriving late etc. There is a small range of food available for sale e.g. microwave meals etc."

2423,MrWhite11,2012-08-31,5.0,"Pleasantly surprised I registered a new tripadvisor account to add this review. On the outside it appears to be a standard business hotel but there is more to it. The location is excellent and convenient for Temple Quay, the city centre and Cabot Circus. I was impressed by the turnout and manner of the staff who seemed to really care about providing a good service. The manager even took the time to respond personally to my request which was very good of her. Don't expect all the bells and whistles of the full-fat Hilton but it's not supposed to be that. The decor was modern and looked to have been quite recently refurbished. The iMac in the room was a stylish touch made better by free Internet access. The cafe does very acceptable coffee to go. I have selected a 5-star rating as 'excellent' most accurately describes my experience."

The room was clean, love the white bedding, apple pc was good to watch tv although it did fail us a couple of times. Lobby was clean and bright and staff were ok some more friendly than others. The breakfast was very nice and worth the money and staff were helpful in the resturant area. Bar was ok although they had near enough run out of largers, luckily i drink wine but my husband was a little gutted. Didnt eat there at night so can't comment. It took us about 10-15 minutes to walk into the shopping center and across the green at the entrance of hotel there was a nice italian to eat. Overal happy with the stay and would go again."
2425,kapitanchina,2011-10-31,4.0,Stayed here it was The Mint Hotel I actually thought this was a great no-frill hotel for someone on a business trip.  The room was modern and spacious (compared to the Enterprise Hotel at Earls Court that I stayed the previous night).  Good location in town (where we had dinner) and greenery behind where there was a nice park.
2426,Ascocomico,2012-07-31,3.0,"Overpriced I stayed at this hotel for two days. Arrived just before 10pm. Restaurant was closed. Asked staff where I could buy a takeaway. Not very helpful. Ended up buying frozen meal from the Pavilion pantry - what a fancy name for a fridge with poor quality overpriced frozen food. 
I asked staff to book a taxi for morning. Ended up waiting for a taxi which had not been booked. 
A very impersonal approach to guests. i wonder if it has something to do with how much they are paid. They just seem to be there to do a job not look after guests. I have stayed at various  Premier Inn hotels and staff are much nicer. 
The rooms are clean and have a modern decor and the imac is a fancy addition although I would have preferred a proper TV as remote is more straighforward to use. Other strengths include a fridge in room, good wardrobe space, microwave downstairs, gym- although did not use it
Some reviewers wrote about a wonderful breakfast. I found it to be ordinary and overpriced. No salmon as mentioned in some reviews. Yes there was a waffle making machine but waffles are really not my thing. 
This hotel is ok if you get it for less than the price of premier inn."
2427,HedonistLondon,2012-06-30,5.0,"Breakfast with super heroes! This was a weekend stay in Bristol. No experience on other hotels, but as a frequent guest at the Hilton chain I decided to go with them. 

Arriving a bit late on Friday it was getting dark, and the short walk from the station didn't look promising - is the hotel in the middle of a business park and not in the city centre? Perhaps a bit of both: handy for corporate travelers, but later on learned that from the other side of the hotel you can also reach the thick of things very easily. Garden Inn is part of Hilton, but do not expect the full fat Hilton standards, nor do you pay for all the extras either. Rooms here are a bit compact, but that is compensated with functionality and comfort. Bathrooms look small, and they are but yet not cramped. Powerful shower, plenty of towels in various sizes and a very good variety of toiletries. Spotless all over.

Big beds, Apple iMac & tv hybrid with free internet - how good is that! Plenty of channels and all what you need from the internet. Fridge for your own stuff and further items available 24/7 by the reception. But naturally with a premium.

So for the super heroes... Ever had breakfast with Superman, Hulk and Batman? I did! Well, there was also a very bearded lady too.... this seemed to be high season for hen and stag parties (all over town). However, the ones in this establishment behaved. Even in the evening very well in order, not a sound during the night and particularly quiet during the breakfast.

And the breakfast is good. Plenty of choice at hand, and you can also get a good variety of items cooked to order. As it was a busy weekend, the breakfast was extended until noon. Again it shows that they give choice to guests, and in a very classy way separate early birds and the night owls. Simply brilliant!

Bar staff at hand and know their thing, but the bar is pretty clinical.

So why a 5 star rating? This is not a five star hotel with all the glitz and glamour, yet they provide truly good value for money. Where poorer quality places (think e.g. Premier Inn) claim to be cheap, they only turn out to be cheap in terms of what you get but expensive in terms of what they charge. This is definitely the case for weekend rates in Bristol, so go compare.

Staff very kind and responsive, they seem to take pride in what they do. Makes a difference.

Next visit to Bristol is in the cards, but the date is still a bit foggy. Choice of hotel is known."

On arrival we were made extremely welcomed and as it was my birthday I was given two drinks voucher to use in the bar later.

The room was comfortable and well presented.

We choose to eat in the restaurant and enjoyed a meal.  It was nice to be able to sit outside on the veranda with a coffee after our meal.

The breakfast was like a banquet - plenty on offer from Smoked Salmon to Porridge.  

Pleasantly surprised to find that the Harbour Festival was on over this weekend which meant the hotel was ideally located for the Harbour, City Centre and the Railway Station.  

It was great to have a Map of the surrounding area free from the Hotel reception.  We will defanety be returning to this hotel."

For about the same price as a premier inn I found this hotel and thought it a good opportunity to stay. I was very happy with its location forw work and on arrival knew I had made a good choice. The rooms are great and clean and well equipped with a comfy bed and imac which doubles as a tv and computer which you can use for free. The restaurant had a select choice of dinner options but what I chose tasted great even if it was a little small. Breakfast was just as good with waffles made to order!

As long as I can get a rate as competitive as I did this will be my number 1 choice when staying in bristol for work."

Although we are a couple room decked out for a single person.  Room tidy and clean, few stains on carpet, bed small as was the bathroom. Nice touch having the mac in the room.
Nice pub out the front of the hotel turn right. Turn right at roundabout and walk hundred yards.
Breakfast overpriced as is the car parking.
For the price it offers fair value, but souless"
2433,RedDivaExmouth_Devon,2012-03-31,5.0,"Lovely hotel, amazing breakfast. From the minute we arrived, the staff were helpful and friendly. Our room was beautifully clean and well appointed. The products in the bathroom were lovely, and for once I actually used them, rather than the ones I had brought with me. The imac was exciting, even for me, a technophobe. I'm now very tempted to buy one! The flowers were lovely, as was the view from our room...overlooking a very green park. We slept very well, and eagerly looked forward to breakfast. Well, we weren't disappointed. The array available was immense and very very fresh. The options were many and I must say that the scrambled eggs with the cooked breakfast were the best I've ever tasted...beautifully creamy and soft. The recipe please! This  breakfast was really so good, better than that served in many more opulent hotels. Despite cheekily having second helpings, I still found some room when  idiscovered the amazing waffle machine. Well done to all the staff, especially those serving breakfast.
Would definitely stay again. Well done!"

2436,BBSB1,2012-07-31,4.0,"It's a Hilton. But a new, decent and thoughtfully designed one Nice, fairly anonymous place, quite near Templemead's train station (Bristol's main station - walking distance, though maybe not with big bags). It really is simply a Hilton hotel - nicely designed, decent rooms - with iMacs not tvs - and free wifi. 

If the location and price suit, this is a good choice. Probably more business or visiting family / friends in Bristol - as pleasant as it is the hotel itself isn't likely to form a highlight of the  trip (it's a Hilton!)."
2437,hjrees,2012-07-31,5.0,"Great hotel, great value The hotel is convenient for both Cabots and the Waterfront (10 min walk). Our room was quiet and looked out over the park. Aircon was a godsend, we had it on all the time. Not the largest room but very comfortable and well appointed. The cleaners were amazing even washing the wine glasses we bought with us!. Breakfast was great, staff so helpful and friendly and couldnt do enough for you. We felt really relaxed and looked after here. Only downside is that parking is quite tight and if you park on the hatched area (its allowed) your car will be a toilet for the birds!!!! Having said that would definately stay here  again when in Bristol."

Breakfast: good quality, lots of choice - the highlight for me being the waffle machine where you could make your own waffle with syrup and fruit compote to go with it!
Service: friendly, we had a meal in the restaurant and they were understaffed at the time so it was quite slow but the waitress was apologetic and tried her best under the circumstances."

Despite being very busy the staff at breakfast were excellent and well trained, all food being replenished very quickly and the freshly cooked breakfast superb.  Nicely positioned hotel, walking distance to all parts of Bristol, whether it be for shopping, theatre or just sightseeing.  Nice toiletries in bedroom, which is becoming quite rare these days.  A very pleasureable experience."

2444,Jacandhow,2012-06-30,5.0,"In city center very convenient We stayed here 2 nights, using our Hilton Honor Points.

We had a very nice bright room overlooking the park, nicely furnished good amount of wardrobe and drawer space nice bathroom, and the most amazing TV that was an apple computer as well, so I was able to keep logged in.

We did not have breakfast as it was not included and would of cost us £13 each, but there is a fridge in the room, so went to the local Tesco 5 minute walk away got some milk and cornflakes (we had taken bowls and spoons with us) we also put some sandwiches and fruit in the fridge so while we were out we only had to stop for a drink.

The tourist bus is just a short walk away, if you go out the back door, through the park and then turn left you will come to the stop, but if like us you are early risers then go to Temple Mead Station the bus will leave there much earlier.

There is a very nice restaurant which we might of eaten in as they take the Taste Card,(it had a very nice menu), so we would of got 50% off, but we had Tesco Vouchers to use in Cafe Rouge so we ate there in Cabot Circus which was a 5 minute walk away.

If we are in Bristol again we will stay here"
2445,walkformilers,2012-07-31,4.0,"Good option for a cheap weekend stay This hotel is everything you need for a weekend.  Rooms small but have got everything you need when you are away from home and are clean and modern.
There were a few hen/stag parties but we didn't hear them during our stay.  About 10 minutes from the centre but plenty around the area if you don't fancy the walk.  If in Bristol again would definitely consider another stay."
2446,leesons2002,2012-06-30,4.0,"Breath of Fresh Air The front desk service is superb, friendly, personable and polite without being over familiar. I have stayed here twice and it is now my preferred hotel in Bristol.

The restaurant is fine but service can be a little slow.

Rooms are modern, a little cramped but excellent value.

Location, if you are travelling by train to or from Bristol, is hard to beat.

I hope that one of the senior managers at Hilton reads this and rewards the front desk team!!!"
2447,davidhchess,2012-06-30,4.0,"As good as I remember, but watch out for the party crowd! We stayed at the hotel for three days, from Friday to Monday, having stayed at the City Inn through it's past incarnations on a number of occasions.

Parking is not cheap at £10 per night and can be hard to come by if you arrive late, although there is a car park at the rear. The hotel is well placed, being a 10 minute walk or so to the city centre. Public rooms are well appointed. The bar area has a comparatively inexpensive range of snacks and light meals on offer. The prices in the restaurant seemed reasonable though we didn't try it this time around. Breakfast is buffet style and the quality was quite acceptable though service levels creaked a bit under pressure when a large number of guests were present on Saturday morning.

Staff were generally pleasant and helpful.

The room was well appointed and serviced, though a drawer did not work properly and the small mirror in the bathroom was not secure and maintenance were not available to deal with these matters over the weekend. As before, wifi was free and a Mac was available for use, though the screen was rather small for modem tastes.

The bathroom had an effective shower but no bath. 

The room seemed quiet enough, but on Friday night a large party caroused until 4 a.m. in the morning shouting and screaming at the top of their voices. So, no sleep for me! I ought to have complained I suppose, but didn't. Hotel staff did not address this matter, though the following day a bottle of wine was offered as recompense when I finally complained.

So, still a good hotel but if they are going to appeal to the hen and stag party and equivalent crowd, they need to work out how they are going to manage in the early hours when things get out of hand otherwise clients like me might think twice before booking again."
2448,GerryJ706,2012-06-30,4.0,"Enterprise Dinner I have stayed at this hotel a few times when it was the City Inn and the Mint now it is part of the Hilton Group and the good news is that they have managed to combine the best features with the backing of a large chain. Each room has an iMac system and free WiFi that all works well.We have needed a Hilton in the City for a long time. You can park your car at or by the hotel and discover the sights of Bristol. The rooms are small but well planned and modern. The restaurant is better than than you find in most hotels and many locals dine here. The excellent ""City"" staff are still here and they make you really welcome. The Garden Inn is a great addition to the many hotels in Bristol.
The only down side is that room rates have gone up."
2449,mjsp123,2012-06-30,4.0,"Clean, Modern, Shame it's not got the full Hilton experience tho.... This Garden Inn is well located, great value, clean and modern...

Stayed one night whilst in Bristol meeting old friends.

Great service from the staff (some of the so called full hiltons should learn from them).

I macs in the rooms add a level of fun and modernity to the rooms, and the bathrooms are well designed with good quality showers !

My only gripe is its a shame they have none of the trimmings of the city Hiltons like the Exec lounges etc... Compared to a lot of the older places Hilton has this is a cut above."
2450,Waytooslow,2012-06-30,4.0,"Just right This hotel is clean and modern and in a great location for walking to lots of Bristol centre attrractions.  Receptionists and breakfast staff were friendly, polite and helpful.  The breakfast was good and, pleasingly, included in the price of the room!

The bed was really comfy.  We like a really cool room in a hotel (hotels tend to be overheated and stuffy) so when we arrived we immediately put the air con on.  It didn't seem to work, and - like on many occasions, we thought it wouldn't work. We reported it to reception, without holding out much hope of anything being done (bitter experience!) but when we came back to our room later that evening, the air con had been fixed and the room was lovely and cool.  

Highly recommend."
2451,SmileyBlondieGirl84,2012-05-31,4.0,"Modern, Clean, Fashionable Hotel With Sky Sports For Free! I stayed for 1 night with my boyfriend on a room only basis for £65 on a Saturday night.
We arrived around 3pm and had trouble parking and had to use the pay and display carpark opposite the hotel which was a little annoying as we picked this hotel for hotel carparking but it transpires it turned out cheaper than the hotel carpark!
Check in was a little slow due to larger groups of men checking in but when we did it was quick and swift. 
The room was lovely. Good size and very modern finishes. Good technology available too - couldn't believe sky sports was available at no extra charge on the TV - never experienced it in a hotel before for free.
Bathroom toilietries were good - mouthwash included too. Towels and linen were fine and lovely power shower. Fair size and very clean.
The hotel isn't as close as I thought it was to the city centre - about 10-20 minute walk depending on how far you want to venture into Bristol but when you've got heels on it's a taxi job!
No complaints about noise and checkout was again fuss free.
Would definately stay again."

2454,Matti-Pringle,2012-06-30,5.0,"Hotel staff do not get as friendly as this! The British hotel industry is not always known for its patience with and deep love of children, especially small energetic toddlers like ours with the frequent propensity to annoy and knock things over. 'Let them be seen and not heard', tends to be how it goes in my experience, which is very different to prevailing attitudes in other parts of Europe. Nevertheless, whoever trained the staff of the Hilton Garden Inn Hotel in Bristol did a stellar job in burying the aforementioned antediluvian attitudes. 

To a man and woman, the hotel personnel were as friendly and helpful as they come, starting in reception, at the bar and in the restaurant. The bar man even went as far as agreeing to arrange for a dish to be made for our little one which was not even on the menu! The breakfast team strived to humour him, as we attempted to feed him the most important meal of the day. So, top marks to everyone on duty on 17-18 June!       

More generally, the hotel is very comfortable for a mid-range establishment and, very conveniently, is located just a couple of minutes’ walk away from Bristol Temple Meads train station and the airport shuttle departure point. In addition, the waterside restaurant/bar area is 10-15 minutes stroll away. As mid-range hotels go, this one deserves all 5 stars: well done."

2456,NikiH184,2012-06-30,4.0,"Great customer service! Exceeding the customers expectations is what great customer service is all about and this hotel certainly did that! We arrived very early and nipped in to ask directions to walk into the city centre. We were given a map, advised where to go and what to see and asked what we would like to do, and all this from a waiter who just happened to be in reception when we arrived! The room was very comfortable  and the iMac very useful. The Breakfast was very good with lots of choice and it was great having the eggs cooked fresh to order. I was disappointed about the £10 charge to park my car, if this was added to the cost of the hotel I would not have booked, so I did feel a bit hoodwinked about that, especially as there was no option but to pay. However, I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone, just be prepared for the parking charge!"

About 3 mins walk from Temple Meads & the nearby Wetherspoons, an about 15 mins walk from Cabots Circus. Car Park is £10 but I suspect is for length of stay not by the day - best check. Would stay again."
2459,GNHEAL,2012-06-30,4.0,"Nice place to stay Booked here having stayed here quite a while ago when it was a City Inn, for me it's the ease of finding and driving to the place! I note from previous reviews that the place looks tired, yes the stairway to the bedrooms look a little tired in places but the rooms are well above what I was expecting! The bedroom was spotless as was the bathroom, the room was a little hot requiring the aircon overnight but at least it has aircon! The bar area is quite modern and good service, beer is a little pricy however.Checking in/out was slick, and of note on this visit there are features that would appeal to anyone staying longer than a night or two IE gym & laundry room. Parking is available at £10 but must admit it is really tight and with the best will in the world you cannot help but avaoid door contact with other cards given the space available."
2460,troublefishblue,2012-06-30,3.0,"Third time lucky? I have stayed at this hotel before under two different names The City Inn and The Mint. It is much improved as The Hilton. However there is still room for improvement. Online I was promised a queen sized room but the reality was a tiny room with a chair that didn't fit in the room properly if you wanted to use the cupboard, the fridge etc. You couldn't stay in this room for more than two nights as it was too small. A nice iMac in the room that is your tv but no keyboard but free wifi. A bit odd. Bought a bottle of wine from room service and paid £25 for a £7.99 bottle of wine. So don't do that.
Breakfast was ok you can order poached eggs, scrambled eggs with smoked salmon etc. Pretty good but quite a wait. 
Nice central location well within walking distance to most places. Overall a good hotel but rooms need work and a room service menu in the rooms would be nice.
Staff were all helpful. Not quite up to normal Hilton Standards. Wondering if the garden inn addition to the name means it's a cheaper version?"
2461,isobelmalloy,2012-06-30,3.0,Worth a visit at the right price The room was comfortable and clean . I tried to contact reception but did not get a response. I required extra milk. A biscuit would not have gone amiss on the tea tray in the room. The breakfast was poor. We ordered black pudding and it arrived when our breakfast was finished. I do not like making my toast as my food gets cold. Three goes to brown the toast. The food area was poorly arranged. The staff seemed to be trying their best but there appeared to be a lack of leadership. They were all working in a vaccum.
2462,mp6283,2012-06-30,4.0,"Amazing value for money on sale I booked a room at this hotel for £50 when we were travelling in this region and I thought it was incredible value for money.

Clean and quiet, decent location (we just walked everywhere), great bed, good bathroom and the cool Apple TVs.  Apart from the fact that the rooms were a little on the small side, this had all the ammenities of higher branded Hilton.

Staff were everything I expected from a Hilton hotel. Also, when our friends visited us at the hotel for an hour they simply waved their parking charge. Excellent customer service."

2464,SBCGP,2012-06-30,5.0,"Quality Having stayed at the hotel previously when it was a City Inn/Mint hotel we were a little apprehensive as to whether the previous hotel group's individual nature would be submerged in corporate greyness. However, if anything, the hotel has improved - without exception all staff were excellent, food was of a high standard (we opted for a remarkably good value GBP 100 dinner, bed and breakfast deal), and the refurbishment that had been carried out had been well-executed. Minus points? The rooms are small for two people - the bathrooms very much so, and parking in the hotel car park is expensive (there is on-street parking that's free overnight but you have to feed the pay-and-display machine at 08:00). Overall, a comfortable and pleasant stay"

4* Hotel bar didn't have any brandy then barmen spent 5mins trying to use the till for 2 drinks.
Breakfast was a joke,had to Que for ages to use the only toaster which was useless, put bread through twice to get well warm bread, know wonder the Que was big. Then shuffled along at the breakfast bar to where the beans weren't!  after waiting best part of 10 minutes with several others  i gave up to eat my now luck warm breakfast and cold toast, i mean bread.

Rooms would benefit from a) face cloth  b) biscuits. The small pantry downstairs in reception is an excellent idea and I appreciated the ice lollies. Easy place to meet up with colleagues first thing in the morning. Free wifi with easy connection. Nice food in the evening and my colleagues loved the salmon sandwiches.

Staff really friendly, restaurant was very good for lunch. Given Hilton bought this hotel and preserved its modern character, so its a real notch above usual Garden Inn locations.

Very bright modern,apple mac in rooms for TV or web very impressive.

Bar was clean and enjoyable, onsite resturant offered a reasonable meal a little different from standard hotel fare.

The Hilton Garden Inn is now even better. It is very ably run by Mark the Reception Manager who is most obliging and leads a very efficient, friendly team. It was reassuring to be welcomed back by the great reastaurant staff and we thoroughly enjoyed all our meals. Our room was on the rear 5th floor which is quickly  accessed by the swift , silent lifts.Our room was very clean with a fridge, safe and tea making facilities. Rooms are well insulated to minimise disruptive noise levels. Car parking is £10 per day but there is a regular bus service right outside the hotel. Bar staff are very freindly and I must thank David the late night barman who can certainly make a superb cocktail. I thoroughly recommend this hotel and will definitely return. Thanks once again Hilton Garden Inn."

Providing free wifi and a mac TV was excellent but to realise late at night that there was no drinking water in the room, although there was a fridge, was most disappointing.  As was the breakfast on the first morning which was cold and mostly cooked in water and the only plates available were cold. The beds were exceptionally comfortable and would have been even better if they were a little larger.Staff were excellent, from the moment we booked to checking out, with the exception of a  guy on the reception desk on the Saturday morning who obviously just didn't want to be there.

We had a great meal in the City Cafe on the Saturday night, presentation, quality and service were superb.  

All in all we would stay here again but skip breakfast and stock the in-room fridge with water."

Hotel very clean in all aspects, staff most courteous and helpful, in particular the staff in the lounge bar and City Cafe.
Food in the City Cafe on both evenings was a delight, presentation and quality faultless, my compliments to the chef. Good value for money. Pleasent ambience.

The hotel was very clean and I have to say, for European standards, it was quite roomy. The bathroom, although small, was clean and well equiped. 
A few minutes walk to the Bristol central train station made it easy to go places, and it is also within walking distance of the city historical downtown and within walking distance of the mall area.
Not too expensive it is a good choice for travelers. The only thing: breakfast was a little on the expensive side and they served exactly the same thing every day."
2480,S7ARJ,2012-04-30,4.0,"Great City Centre Position......... I rang the hotel the day before my husband and I arrived to request a room at the back of the hotel as I felt it would be quieter. I spoke to a lady by the name of Annie, she was most helpful and allocated us a top-floor room overlooking the pretty park. 
Room: fairly small but it had been beautifully refurbished and contained everything which we needed to make our short break comfortable. Large bed with crisp linen, plenty of storage space, 'T' tray, absolutely loads of mirrors and an, (empty), fridge, handy for our own drinks. There was a voucher to hand in to reception which gave us a bottle of water each, which was a nice touch. Quiet a/c, Mac computer. We loved it all.
Bathroom: Yes, on the small side too but spotlessly clean with large shower cubicle and endless hot water. Plenty of soft white towels. One bath robe, but a quick word with our room girl, sylvia, and she quickly produced another one so we did not have to fight over one robe. Oh, and slippers too! Thank you Sylvia, you are doing a good job!
Dining Room: We chose to only eat breakfast here. It is the usual feast for which Hilton is famous. The only critisism is that the food never seems hot enough but this seems to be a common fault with buffets. The plates were at a disadvantage too as they were kept on a shelf and of course, were cold.
Staff: friendliness and professionalism in an equal mix all contributed to make our short stay very enjoyable.
Would certainly return if the occasion arose because the position of the hotel made exploring Bristol on foot so easy."
2481,WYWH,2012-04-30,4.0,"Same but Different? Have stayed in this hotel now for about the last 4 years-ish; it's now on its 3rd name change.  It's last incarnation was the City Inn, very little to denote its now a Hilton, other than the door signage. Rooms are excellent, with Mac PCs and everything you'd need for a short stay. Only criticism is that there is one chair too many in the rooms, making it rather cluttered.

The mini bar has been replaced by a vending area in reception, that rather randomly serves microwave ready meals?

Only change that I could see was the breakfast is now from a servers rather than al la carte as the City Inn had.  As a result, the breakfast, whilst good, was not great.

Staff great, location great."
2482,riverview-apartment,2012-04-30,5.0,"Excellent restaurant and great value We organised a wedding lunch here following our marriage at Bristol registry office less than a mile away.

Myself and family members stayed at the hotel the night before the wedding, including dinner, and some stayed for the following night too.

The location is excellent, a few minutes walk from Temple Meads train station, adjacent to a photogenic park with ruined church where we had photographs taken.

Drinks and canapes on the terrace overlooking the park and then a formal meal in the restaurant where the food is excellent quality.

The hotel car park is quite small but there is a pay and display less than 100 metres away which compensates for this.

The rooms are finished to a good level and a reasonable size too. Common sense applied, this isn't a 5 star hotel and doesn't claim to be, but it certainly DOES exceed the expectation for the price and I would highly recommend it for a Bristol city centre visit."
2483,JessieL976,2012-04-30,4.0,"Great breakfast! Hotel room on the small side, but very clean and tidy and was perfect for a couple.  Mac computer in room was nice, able to access internet and the tv.  When I checked in, the man helping me at the front desk was quite rude, talked in a quiet mumble and had overall terrible customer service skills.  Once we past him the rest of the staff was very helpful and personable (bar staff, staff working during breakfast the next morning and the lady helping me when I checked out).  The breakfast was also wonderful! We paid for it when we booked the room, but it was worth it.  All you could eat buffet with a waffle iron to make your own waffles, a cook fixing up any type of eggs that you want, oatmeal, yogurt, pastries, you name it."
2484,BillF439,2012-04-30,4.0,Very good hotel we visited the hotel for 1 night and our room was newly refurbished and was very comfortable the reception staff were very helpful and i would definately return to the hotel in the future
2485,OutnAbout007,2012-04-30,5.0,"Smart hotel in ideal location Stayed for a weekend break and could find no fault.
Staff were polite and attentive, genuinely interested in us having a good time. Craig, the General Manager, runs a very good ship.
The bedroom had recently been refurbished - you could smell the new carpet aroma !! 
Bathroom immaculate and clean. Great large shower cubicle. No bath but not a problem.
iMac computer and tv. Really useful to be able to look up local weather and attractions without needing to bring or find a separate pc.
Breakfast buffet was superb. A wide choice of cereals, yoghurts, pastries, porridge, breads and full English selection. Also able to order salmon and scrambled eggs, black pud, kippers and more. Exciting to be able to cook your own waffles in a waffle maker. Not cheap at £13.95 but you could eat enough to tide you over lunchtime too !!
Rear of Hotel overlooks small churchyard and is very quiet. Front may be noisier, as it fronts onto Temple Way. Car Park a little cramped during the peak but better than walking too far with cases.
About 5 mins walk from Temple Mead railway station.
10 mins walk to Cabot Circus and Broadmead Shopping Centres - the former a very smart, modern complex, some under cover, some not.
The riverside Bars and Restaurants are a shortish walk away and offer plenty of variety.
A good base for sure."

The staff member checking us in was very polite but a little stiff and answered the phone whilst checking us in (he was the only one manning the desk at 4pm on a saturday) We stayed on the 4th floor, our view wasn't great but it was very quiet considering the busy road we were overlooking. The rooms are great, plenty of storage, bright, light with great added extras such as the apple mac with free internet access. Bathrooms are a little on the small side and could feel claustrophobic if you stayed a few days. Would definetly stay again. Didn't try the breakfast."
2487,TruroAggiebella,2012-04-30,5.0,"Great! Room was bright and spotlessly clean. Triple glazing kept the noise out and aircon in room so the temperature can be controlled. Polite and efficient staff. good location... we could'nt have wanted more... best hotel weve stayed in in ages, well done."

We stayed 2 nights dinner, bed and breakfast, the dinner was very good but it was a shame the dining room lacked any atmosphere. Breakfast was also very good my only criticism was that the hot food was not hot. It would've helped if the plates were kept warm but there was no facility to do this also, the containers for the hot food just didn't keep the food at a decent temperature."

Other than that, good location and managed to enjoy our stay."
2491,RosieF696,2012-02-29,3.0,"Better when it was the Mint Pros:
*iMac in room
*fitness room (though very small)
*location- right by Temple Meads
*comfortable bedding
*curtains block out all street lighting

Cons:
*disappointing breakfast- scrambled eggs very sloppy; everything kept running out and had to wait 10mins for more to be brought out on two occasions; when breakfast is busy, waiters are very slow to serve tea/coffee
*mini bar in room not stocked- you have to go downstairs to the lobby to buy food/drinks
*shower temperature was occasionally burning hot even turned down to lowest heat setting and sometimes fluctuated from hot to cold
*air con did not work in one room I stayed in
*iMac in one room I stayed in was slow and kept crashing

Booked the hotel when it was still the Mint, and we were not informed it had changed to the Hilton Garden Inn prior to our arrival.
I much preferred this hotel as the Mint (stayed there May 2011)- there was a better breakfast selection and mini bars in the rooms were stocked with good quality snacks (like Green & Blacks chocolate)."
2492,TravellingBen,2012-03-31,5.0,"Great hotel now much better - good gym Stayed here three times in past couple of weeks since updated to Hilton Garden Inn - rooms haven't changed apart from minibar emptied - there is now a snack fridge at reception - much cheaper (beer £2) and convenient.

Loved hotel before - still like it now. Gym was always rubbish - now is great with brand new machines on ground floor and about 4 times size. Resistance machine and free weights, although no bench so a bit limited to use weights. Need to sort out the automatic lights as go off when on machines - but only gripe.

Still free wifi, great iMac in room (bring DVD for night in) and decent room service and location. Now get Hiltonhonors points too which is great!

Thoroughly recommend"
2493,67IanW,2012-03-31,5.0,would definitely recommend We have just returned from a 2 night stay & would recommend this hotel . We arrived mid afternoon on Tuesday & parked in the hotel's car park after which we explored the city using public transport (bus stop outside front door ) & on foot. The bedroom was relatively quiet with the window open ( quieter than the air con. ) The beds were very comfortable & the fridge enabled us to keep fresh milk & other drinks chilled. The fittings were of a high standard ( Matki shower screen ) Apple TV . We ate in the cafe rather than the restaurant on the second night of our stay & enjoyed a very well cooked & presented meal which was good value. All the staff were friendly & helpful & we would definitely stay again.
2494,jaysel,2011-08-31,5.0,"Always excellent I have stayed here on business about 5 or 6 times and always look forward to it.
It has been great since it was a City Inn, then becoming Mint.
The rooms are always clean & fresh. The food is tasty & value for money - and the bar has had some interesting ales on in the past.
Check in & out is always easy.
My only gripe is the parking. There is not nearly enough parking, and you often get some chancer blocking you in. One poor guy blocked me in when I was due on site at 05:00, so reception had to wake him up. I didn't have the heart to mention that I could have collected my car after the meeting!

All in all one of the better hotels, and one that I thoroughly recommend"

2497,MoonrakerHampshireUK,2012-02-29,5.0,"Excellent staff who go the extra mile We had a very happy stay in a double room from 24 to 26 February 2012 and I just want to highlight how well the staff dealt with something that went wrong.  On checkout, I left behind a carrier bag with my diary and other items in it.  After a couple of days it turned up and this was undoubtedly due to the care and effort of Josh who checked us in and out and Opie who took my call about the loss.  I should tell readers and Tripadvisor that we had a concessionary rate via a staff member (not named above).  Although I have had to certify that I have no personal relationship with the hotel, and would never normally submit a rating, I want to report this to readers because this kind of thing could happen to anyone."

All rooms are modern with iMacs in the room and amenities that you'd expect in a four star hotel.  Restuarant/bar are very good, though a little pricey, and I ended up with a free dinner as they forgot my order - good customer service on the whole as they adequately resolved the issue without me needing to complain.

Close to Temple Meads so an ideal location."
2499,BlondesHavFun,2012-02-29,4.0,"Quiet, clean, great food Room was slightly small but that was only downside. Ups were: comfy bed, hot shower, quiet, free Wi-Fi, great tv, and an absolutely delicious breakfast. Would definitely recommend this hotel as great value for money."
2500,smokeyrolo,2012-02-29,3.0,"lacking something Having stayed here many times in the past when the hotel was trading as the City Inn, I feel the standard is much less now. I had booked a club room at a club room price. However, because I needed a twin the room seemed quite small, I thought club rooms were bigger, they used to be. But not on this occasion! I did enquire and was told that there is only a small allocation of these rooms. Oh well! My fruit platter was not in the room upon my arrival, I ordered a newspaper for the following morning and it never materialised. The breakfast was so basic in terms of no service, I was served tea and nothing else, I used to have toast and a cooked breakfast made fresh to order and delivered to me. The trouble with a DIY breakfast is when everyone comes to breakfast at the same time, you end up queuing whilst your cup of tea is going cold. Breakfast I found quite stressful. 

This hotel used to be great, now I'm not so sure!"
2501,Lovecorrie,2012-02-29,4.0,"Mint Hotel Bristol On the day I arrived the restaurant and bar had not quite opened following a refit and the same applied to the health club.  A restaurant had been set up in  small conference room, which was deserted when I looked in.

Otherwise the room was very nice, good size and very clean with the added advantage of mac computer/tv. I paid an extra £10 for a club upgrade,this gave me VIP status, although I didn't notice any difference in my status from staying in an any other hotel. I did get fruit in the room and a welcome drink so maybe that was my status upgrade!

The hotel is a 10 min walk to the city centre but if you didnt want to go too far I found a nice italian restaurant immediately across the park at the back of the hotel."
2502,Groovy146,2012-02-29,5.0,"Friendly and well appointed city hotel I stayed at the Mint Hotel in Bristol for one night and was very impressed with the friendly welcome and well appointed room. The free wi-fi was a nice touch (so many big hotels choose to fleece people with that!) as was the iMac in the room. The bedroom was not huge, but it was very pleasant and quiet which was just what was needed.

There was some construction work happening so breakfast was in a different room, but this was carefully explained and the breakfast was a perfectly calm and pleasant experience.

The location is very close to Bristol Temple Meads railway station and the main shopping centre so I highly recommend this hotel for a city visit."
2503,brubeck2016,2012-02-29,4.0,"Very good hotel and friendly staff We stayed overnight in the Mint Hotel when we had booked to see a show. Although our room was small, it was modern, spotlessly clean and well-appointed with a safe and refrigerator. The restaurant staff were extremely helpful and friendly  and the food was very good. Car parking was £10 per day.There was a bus  stop directly outside the hotel and the regular  bus service  took you to the flourishing  Cabot Shopping Centre and harbourside which has a wide choice of restaurants.   The railway station is  conveniently located a few hundred yards from the hotel  We had a rear room on the top floor and  never heard any traffic. The lifts were silent and efficient. Agnes the Receptionist was particularly  pleasant and very helpful. We visited the fascinating MShed museum on the harbourside  which  has free  admission  and enjoyed  an outstanding interactive display of the historical development  of Bristol and its people.  There was a charge to visit the display of fashion photographs on the 3rd floor. Have booked another stay at The Mint Hotel next month although I understand it has just been taken over by the Hilton so I hope it maintains its high standards and customer focus."
2504,BronKJ,2012-01-31,4.0,"Nice, clean and quiet rooms in good location. Nice clean and quite room, with a nice view over the park. Having the apple mac was a bonus and good to have something to play music on whilst getting ready to go out. Not in the most picturesque location but a good option if going out in Bristol as relatively close to everything. Especially good location if you've driven or got the train.
Breakfast was excellent with a really big choice. Although if I was having to pay for it on top of the room (ours was included), I probably would have said it was a little pricey. One word of warning - the bar man may proclaim that he is an amazing cocktail 'mixologist' but he made me the worst cocktail I have ever tasted (he put creme de menthe in a Long Island Iced Tea???) and took about half an hour to make it. My boyfriend also had to talk him through his choice. Meanwhile a table of 3 were still waiting for their beers, which they had ordered before me! Was very frustrating but in hindsight pretty amusing. Somebody tell the boy to stick to what he knows!"
2505,Mark_Helen_8,2012-02-29,4.0,"Perfect for our Needs The hotel was in the process of being reburbished when we visited, but I can't say this affected our stay.  They were rebranding from the Mint hotel to Hilton Gardens on 13.2.12.  The rooms were a little on the small side but were more than sufficient, with a comfortable bed, plenty of lighting, an iMac, plenty of wardrobe space and an iron and ironing board.  The bathrooms were new and clean with rainshowers.  They are a little on the small side, so you may struggle if you are on the larger side.  The car park was open air and had about 50 car parking spaces and was well lit.  For busy times when you can't get in the hotels own car park, there is an open air NCP next door - also openair.  The hotel was in a good location for us, about a 10 minute walk to the bars and restaurants at the harbourside, probably slightly further to the shopping area.  It was quiet at night, so you were not kept awake by revellers in the street.  Extremely friendly and helpful staff."

2508,thewriter,2012-02-29,3.0,"Mint leaves a funny taste in the mouth It was a one off. I was working in Bristol and my wife was having a few friends round for a sleep in. I searched TripAdvisor for a suitable overnight stay with WiFi an absolute priority so that I could file my piece for my newspaper on Sunday morning. The Mint was close to the station and with an old, decent Italian restaurant within walking distance. Having navigated a huge roundabout and eventually found the correct street I quickly checked in , left my bags and went to work.On my return I discovered how bleak the area was and apart from the big , imposing roundabout, the office blocks stood bleak and empty on a Saturday night ion the snow. Come to think of it The Mint was rather similar, not the sort of place you would want to linger for a meal on your own or even a drink at the tiny bar. The saving grace was the room. Basic enough with a nice big bed but excellent in terms of plugs, access to WiFi, mac and excellent and multi use apple television. Work was soon done.But there it stopped.The bathroom was so small that when ( if I may be briefly indelicate) I sat on the loo my legs poked out into the room and as a somewhat large man I had to manoeuvre myself around the shower and sink. Not comfortable at all.
Despite paying £75 for a weekend night, with refurbishments going on, breakfast was not including and the restaurant was not inviting enough to pay for a breakfast. Instead I walked to the station and settled for and orange juice.
Not a hotel I would return to."
2509,northernboy1979,2012-01-31,5.0,"Excellent service We had a weekend in Bristol and pick Mint for location and cost.  The hotel far out weighed the small cost of the room for a night.

The bathroom shower had a myriad of settings, my personal favourite being ""champagne"" - a bubbly downpour to lather up in.  Breakfast was delicious (I highly recommend the porridge) and the waitress that served us had an impeccable manner, polite, efficient, happy and helpful.  Will definitely stay again."

2514,Linzini,2012-01-31,2.0,"Brand over basics, and expensive I see this chain has been sold to Hilton Garden Village Hotels and is rebranding - but the enthusiastic receptionist told me proudly ""but we're keeping the iMacs!""   And that was really how I found the whole hotel - nice staff, gimmicks, but not the room basics - some real maintenance issues.   Perhaps this has suffered because of the prospective sale?  I also found it overpriced (and I was on a corporate rate) - I have stayed in better hotels in Bristol on a cheaper rate.  

On the positive side It's very well located for Temple Meads station (easy five minute walk,  very friendly front of house staff (especially the sommelier) and it was very clean throughout.  The public areas are pleasant.  On the poor side was my bathroom:  shower would only pump dangerously hot water.  You could rotate what I assume was the temperature control  - there are no symbols or instructions - right round and make no difference whatsoever to the heat of the water (I did check the other dial, this just turned the flow on or off).   Since the shower was too hot to stand under, I had to wash my hair in the basin using a mug- there are no baths.  Hairdryer was missing from room.  Metal fittings fell off the bathroom door - appeared to have been glued back on before.  Before all this I rang reception to ask something, the call was not answered for ages and was eventually rerouted to room service who said reception would call back.  They didn't. 

Breakfast was so overpriced I ate by the station - £2.99 for coffee and a bacon and mushroom roll rather than £11 (at check in) or £15 (walk in) in the hotel. Incidentally the soap / shower gel etc is in a wall mounted pump - not what I expected for this room price.

Maybe it will get sorted out under the new brand.  Hope so, very convenient location but disappointing."

Friendly helpful check-in staff, and an unexpected treat in the room - chocolates and wine! Maybe only for ""regulars""? A great start to the weekend. Quiet and peaceful but so close to city centre, docks, and museums. Bristol is so interesting that I hardly had time to play with the iMac in the room!"
2516,Snoozymouse,2011-11-30,3.0,"Good, but let down by breakfast We stayed here for one night in November. The hotel is located about 10 minutes’ walk from Bristol Temple Meads station and about 10 minutes’ walk from the main shopping and bar areas. Our room overlooked the park next to Temple Church and the area was quiet at night. Bristol seems to be a popular destination for hen/stag parties and groups going out at the weekend, and quite a few people checking into the hotel seemed to be there for these reasons, but we were not disturbed by any noise.

The room was standard Mint Hotel. Everything was clean and as expected. Bathrooms are small but functional. There’s free wifi in all rooms, which is great. The rooms also have iMacs which double up as a TV/computer which is useful (there’s a little instruction card next to the screen if you’re unfamiliar with iMacs, and the ‘on’ button is on the reverse of the screen).

Our room rate included breakfast, and I would have been very disappointed if we had purchased it separately as it was not good. We did arrive quite late into the breakfast service, and the restaurant was busy (full of those who had been out the night before), but the staff could have at least tried to smile. There was no welcome, our order was taken quickly and we felt rushed. The cooked breakfast was poor and badly presented and we were given small portions. The coffee was stewed and not drinkable. This experience was an unpleasant end to an otherwise enjoyable stay.

I’d stay here again, but avoid breakfast. The three out of five rating is due to the bathroom being small (a bath would be nice), some of the decor being a bit worn, and breakfast being such a disappointment.

Bristol tip: Clifton and Clifton Suspension Bridge are worth a visit and are easy to get to. From Bristol Temple Meads station take a No. 8 bus. The stops are announced on the bus, so get off at Clifton Village or at Christ Church, Clifton. The Bridge is a short walk from either of these bus stops and there are lots of shops and cafes in the area. On the way back, take the No. 9 bus."
2517,SusanR54,2012-01-31,3.0,"Not bad could be better Stayed here for a couple nights on business.  Rooms not too bad, although they only have a shower not a bath.  The TV is an iMac which is great for those that own one but possibly a bit too ahead of its time for the rest of us.

The food was very good - room service was hot and reasonable.  Breakfast is full English to order or a contintental buffet.  I would say to the Breakfast Manager though that if someone knows what they want and asks you for it on arrival, interrupting half way through the sentence that a waiter will help, who then doesn't materialise, could be handled better."

Mac computer is also your TV and radio in the room, although the remote control was hard to get used to and the computer took a while to load whenever I was changing TV channels.The room size is great for one person, would be a bit small if there was more than 1 occupant. Definitely recommend ordering food from the room service menu if you are stuck in the room at night with bad weather outside. Enjoyed their main course (duck) and desert (Baileys cheesecake). Reception was really helpful. Location wise the hotel is ideal - short walk to Temple Meads station (there is a Starbucks and Weatherspoon on the way to the station) and the main shopping district (The Galleries, Cabot Circuit) is within walking distance."
2522,VMc63,2011-12-31,3.0,"Clean but poor atmosphere & terrible breakfast Location: Easy to locate if coming off the motorway network.  It is situated on the edge of town and a short walk to the centre.  It does have its own carpark (£25 pn, I think) and there is also near-by on-street parking that is free between 6 pm and 8 am but metered thereafter.

Hotel & rooms:  We have stayed in one of the London Mint hotels previously, but Bristol Mint is not in the same league as the London ones.  The reception & bar area are old fashioned looking and completely lacking in atmosphere.  This is, in part, due to the drab lighting/decor and partly to do with the fact that the bar man allowed someone to plug in their own ipod at full volume - someone else's taste at high volume managed to clear the bar area within minutes.   The rooms are pleasant enough - clean & functional with comfortable beds & bedding and the bathroom, though small, was clean also.  

Food:  We only ate breakfast so cannot comment on evening meals. We had the full english included within our package price, but as it was almost inedible, i would have been extremely annoyed if i'd paid for this seperately.  The continental elements were ok but I think they should have mentioned that they clearly didn't have a trained chef in house, as we would have been happy enough with the continental.  I had porridge unlike any porridge i've ever had before, in that it was just oats & milk mixed together and clearly had not been cooked.  My husband had fried eggs that were as solid as frisbies.  Horrible!

A clean, functional hotel near to town & motorway.  I'm not sure that it can be classed as 4* but on the other hand, it was very reasonably priced, so perhaps we got what we paid for.  Personally, I would not use this hotel again."
2523,CharlieW47,2011-11-30,5.0,"Great stay with lovely people I stayed there a couple of weeks ago, and really enjoyed my stay. I found the room incredibly comfortable, and for saying that it's on a main road, it was incredibly quiet! I ate in the City Cafe as well while I was there, and couldn't fault the food - and as a fussy vegetarian, they were really adaptable! The staff were really friendly, and gave me great advice on where to go in Bristol!! Can't fault the hotel or the staff, and would highly recommend staying here!"
2524,shappers00,2011-12-31,4.0,"Great hotel, breakfast standard slipped Great hotel. Good facilities, great location.
Stayed many times, and return as it is of high standard.
Free wifi and iMacs are a bonus, as no other hotel offers similar inclusively.
Breakfast standards slipped though. Bacon and sausage was rubbery and tepidly warm. No cornflakes on the continental this morning. Petty, but did annoy us as returning guests.

Would book again though."
2525,askmeimight,2011-11-30,4.0,"Not the largest rooms - but got all you need I have stayed at this hotel several times. It compares well to similar hotels for the price. 

The TV is an apple mac not a normal TV and has several good points in that its more than a normal TV but its also a tad more complicated. 

Rooms are really pretty small and the shower rooms even smaller. But well equipped. 

Reception staff are very friendly and helpful, the restaurant staff perhaps slightly less so - The breakfast room can be very busy and I would say its only average."
2526,Tillascotland,2011-11-30,4.0,"Small Bathroom My husband and I stayed here last week . The rooms were clean and comfortable but the bathroom was small, the breakfast was not that good ( would have prefered fried not steamed bacon in tooked incipit) and we did have to wait a while for it. Very tricky car park not very big.

Unfortuanatly we did not get the opertunity to try the restaurant but the menu looked nice.

Staff were very helpfull and nothing was to much bother.

Would return to this hotel would have a different breakfast though."
2527,BeeCee63,2011-05-31,5.0,"Lovely accommodation as expected from a Mint Hotel We stayed here for the August Bank Holiday weekend. The Hotel was as expected for a Mint Hotel with high spec bathroom and bedroom. The Apple Mac TV and PC is a nice touch and the bed is very comfortable with good quality pillows - very important when trying to get a good nights sleep after a busy day sightseeing, eating and drinking!
We loved exploring Bristol with the city centre and river about a 15 minute walk away. The hotel was set in a quiet location but there are a few little restaurants and bars close by which we found very useful. Marco's Olive Branch is particlarly nice  which is just a minute away via the old church grounds.

2528,jubec,2011-11-30,5.0,"fab all round!!!! my 11 yr old and myself recently stayed for two nights (weekend) here and can not fault it at all. it def deserves the 4 star rating. the hotel is modern clean and led by very professional staff, even the cleaners do a fab job, as my daughter can be quite messy!!! we loved the bed, very comfy and clean and the bathroom was lovely too. you can set the heating/air con as you like so that was good for me!!, as was the tea, cofee and biscuits provided in our room. the imac in the room was another very nice bonus and the only negative i would say is it did state in your room info there was a complimentary dvd library at reception but when we enquired about it we was told they had to stop it because needed a licence-maybe that should have been checked before advertising it!!! other than that had a great time and even walked to temple meads station with luggage it was that handy. also my daughter enjoyed the well-equipped fitness room as under 16's are allowed with parents."
2529,LUX-LEET,2011-11-30,5.0,"Mint Hotel Bristol, keeps a smile on your face My stay in the Mint Hotel Bristol was excellent, 
as i arrived in my room i saw that it was very clean and very well maintained, the entertainment system was very useful for my work and entertainment as i do my work on a computer the iMac was my best friend in my room as i could do my work and just lay on my bed and watch some TV or listen to the radio after a hard day of work outside of the hotel.
when lunch time came around i was very happy with order and i do recommend it to everyone else who goes to visit this hotel, it is the club sandwich it is simply said just amazing, as i became more or less a local in the hotel everyone knew what i wanted and really made me feel as if i was home, you all know that nothing beats home, but i can say that this comes very close to the convert at your own home.

and all i have left to say is, give it a try for your self so you can have an excellent good night of rest with friendly people around you standing by to help you when needed."
2530,albert511,2011-10-31,4.0,"good value at the Mint hotel Stayed one night at te mint hotel, check in was faultess, booked into an excutive club room. Room itself was modern but a little on the small size but clean. All the technology worked well with the apple mac a nice touch and free wifi. Breakfast was included in my rate and I ate a hearty full english breakfast, quality of the ingredients seemed high. visited in October weather was mild and room was warm."
2531,chillipepper16,2011-11-30,3.0,"Was better when it was City Inn . . . I have stayed at the hotel previously when it was the City Inn. The breakfast has definitely gone downhill since then! Previously we were offered a choice of other hot breakfast items instead of the standard english fry up, such as kippers or eggs benedict. That really set it apart from other hotels, but now it is just the standard continental buffet or a fry up. Saying that, the fry up is lovely, but it would have been nice to have had a choice.
The bed was very lumpy and uncomfortable, and the pillow was really hard! When I rung reception to ask for a different one, they only offer one type of pillow. Even budget hotels offer a choice of pillow (i.e. firm, soft, feather)
The rooms are very clean though and well set out. The iMac is brilliant in the room - love that touch. 
I would stay here again, but disappointed to see has gone slightly downhill."
2532,Salop2011,2011-10-31,4.0,"Special price offered by hotel made it very good value. One night stay in October. Very happy with standard of room, especially cleanliness.Sadly the snacks and drinks supposedly available to buy couldn't be found! The fridge was jammed shut so no way of knowing what was in there. Also very hot-probably because it was built into a cupboard.It eventually cooled after a few hours with the cupboard door open! Oh and the electrical safety sticker was 2 months expired.
One small opening window.I found the bed slightly lumpy but slept ok.
Breakfast was above average'with a good selection. Nice cooked breakfast.
None of the above niggles were unacceptable but for a longer stay we would probably repoerted them to staff.
We would stay there again."
2533,mwgfelix,2011-09-30,4.0,"reasonable priced hotel Stayed one night in September - had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel - sat nav kept saying we had arrived but we couldnt find the hotel. Drove around a bit and asked someone who just happened to be staying in the same hotel and she said that they had had difficulty also. Eventually found the hotel - the trees outside had obscured the hotel name and it looked like an office building. (as you come off the temple circus roundabout - the hotel is adjacent to the temple way dual carriageway- turn left and then left again into temple rose st) The rooms were very IKEA, they were clean and added touches as bottles of wine, crisps/peanuts in the room to tempt you to part with your money.
Breakfast was included - help yourself to cereal and pastries but full english was plated. 
Small bar in hotel and not much directly around the hotel but within a few minutes walk in either direction you came accross pubs, shops and restaurants. 
For the price we paid I was pleasantly suprised.
There is a car park in front of the hotel but if you gain access and there are no spaces you will need a token from reception to exit. There is a pay and display car part accross the road from the hotel (at the rear of the hotel) it was free from 6.00pm to 8.00 am"
2534,Biztraveller74,2011-11-30,4.0,"can't fault it! I chose the Mint hotel after being impressed by their hotel in Manchester and I was very pleased that the Bristol hotel was just as good.   Check in (and out) was swift and friendly, room was as expected with Mac computer, white company products and comfy bed.  Breakfast was very nice and service in the breakfast room was also very good.  Only let down were the bar staff who, whilst being friendly, gave a 'cant be bothered' service.  The location is great for Temple Meads station but it's a bit of a walk to get to the shopping/nightlife area.   All in all I am glad I chose the Mint hotel and would go back again for sure!"
2535,Andricia,2011-11-30,4.0,"Recommended - clean, convenient, efficient, quiet. Stayed for one night on business - room was quiet and clean, bed comfortable and spacious, iMac computer system for tv/radio/computer use excellent. Staff were friendly and helpful. spaces in the car park are narrow as other reviewers have noted, and I do think in a hotel of this standard, a complimentary bottle of water in the room should be included. Felt a bit ripped off to have to pay for a bottle of water from the minibar."
2536,KiwiFromDownUnder,2011-11-30,4.0,"Modern Hotel with Excellent Service Yeap, another business trip into the UK from downunder - and staying at the Mint Hotel for a couple of weeks.

Rooms are small and cosy, but what sets this hotel apart from the many others, is the modern and clean environment - and the attention to detail of the hotel crew.  They must have rigious SOPs, because my room is serviced and cleaned to the same high standard everyday - without fault.  Something the larger hotel chains such as Hilton should take notice of!

Apple Macs in the room is a cool concept, and blends in with the smaller room sizes here.  However, I find myself using the laptop anyway - but definitely a point of difference with other hotels.  And the free WiFi is much appreciated for the business traveller."
2537,sunnytimes78,2011-11-30,4.0,"Good value and modern We recently stayed here for 2 nights and really enjoyed it. I have stayed in other Mint hotels and they seem to have got the formula right- clean, modern accommodation at affordable prices. We had breakfast included in our deal and it was really very good - much better quality than the mass produced options in many hotels. Only thing I was disappointed in was when we called down to book a second night we were quoted a much more expensive rate. When checking this on the free Apple computer in the room we got it for almost £50 cheaper- would have been nice to be offered this as an existing guest! Overall though a great experience and would highly recommend."
2538,MichaelkWhite,2011-10-31,5.0,Very good value and style. Top hotel when have iMac in every room!  Good spot between train station and shops. Rooms are small but well set out with a nice bed. Breakfast is top stuff and well worth the money. Staff are nice but maybe need some more training. Do stay its a great hotel!
2539,newrangerfamily,2011-11-30,4.0,"Modern, clean and great ro
On service I had a Club room on the 3rd floor. The room was very clean and loved the idea of an apple pc tv in the room which worked well. 
I orderded food in my room and this was delivered in 20 mins and was warm and delicious. Heating and cooling controls worked well. My only gripe was that the ironing board was broken and I had to lay it on the bed to iron something, this prevents me from giving 5 stars."

2541,Make_It_A_Large_One,2011-10-31,3.0,"Nice hotel, let down by some aspects of the service Overall the hotel is clean and tidy. The reception service on arrival was first class, friendly and accommodated our request for a room at the back of the hotel. Our room was OK, though a bit tired in places. The hanging space was very odd, not deep enough even to hang a standard gents jacket – about 8 inches too short leaving the jacket dragging on the lower rail or the floor of the cupboard. It would've been useless for a full length dress.

The bar service on our visit was shockingly bad. One evening, having been told by the barman that we would be attended too at our table, he promptly served 2 further couples (who were not there when we arrived). We gave up and left, to find the mini-bar in our room was locked! At the drinks prices charged by this hotel I would have expected much better levels of service. On enquiring at reception the following day about the mini-bar, we were told they are locked at the weekends due to the high number of stag and hen parties they have, who do not pay for drinks. You've been warned."
2542,nickihof,2011-10-31,3.0,"A Premier Inn in everything but name (but with IMac) Clean and convienent this was booked only a few hours before we arrived at a reasonable rate. Lovely welcome from Lucy at the desk after a stressful parking experience; extremely small parking bays! 
Rooms are very small and the loud heating/air con unit needs to be addressed by the chain. I experienced the same loud hum all night in MInt Westminster too.
Wouldn't return as it's too basic to warrant the difference in price between the Mint and a cheaper chain. Would rather pay a little extra and get more comfort and class."
2543,gbf1,2011-10-31,4.0,"Great Bristol Great modern hotel in the heart of Bristol, we had an overnight there on the way South and it’s easy to find. Everything you’d expect from a good hotel, even a Mac in each room which doubles as a TV and lovely shower room, safe and mini bar. We thought the room slightly on the small side or perhaps it had too much furniture in it, however, it was very clean and the bed was excellent, we booked at the last minute and got good value. Although the restaurant looked nice we decided it was a bit pricey and there are plenty of restaurants and cafes within 10 minutes walk, we found two seventeenth century real ale pubs and a good Italian restaurant within a 2 minute walk, through the park. 
You pay for parking, par for the course in a city centre but a useful tip is to get your money back by not having breakfast and go to one of the two cafes 4 minutes walk away, towards the bridge, for a fry up or a croissant and coffee. It’s very handy for the city centre, the shops, nightlife etc, staff are friendly and we’d go back to it anytime."
2544,UKJER,2011-08-31,5.0,"Weekend Away My wife and I have stayed at this hotel twice; once for the Dot to Dot festival with friends and the second time was for a Birthday weekend.

The Mint Hotel is perfectly located between the train station and the main city centre which means it is ideally placed for a weekend away.  The Hotel always lets you leave your bags there before you check in which means you can arrive whenever, drop your bags off and start exploring the city.

The room is comfortable enough to spend time in when you're not exploring and is a very reasonable price for the facilities that you have on offer e.g. imac in room used as home entertainment system.

Room service was a little slow but when the food did arrive it was of a good quality."
2545,Architect53,2011-10-31,4.0,"Comfortable stay at a very good price Had a Saturday night stay at the Mint Hotel, Bristol. Good value for money, comfortable rooms. Thought the car park fee was a bit high (£10 per 24hrs) - when I stayed there before, when it was a City Inn, I seem to think parking was free. But, overall, a good place to stay, and very centrally situated."
2546,funkygibbon32,2011-10-31,4.0,"Nice hotel, good location. I stayed at Mint Hotel Bristol Oct 2011, staying for one night. I arrived by train into Temple Meads Station and walked just under 10 mins to the hotel. I was able to check in about an hour early. The receptionist gave me an efficient, but not too friendly welcome. I just put it down to her being a bit tired, like we all are at work from time to time. 

My room was on the 1st floor overlooking a small park and above the hotel Restaurant/Bar. The room was very clean, with great facillities. The Apple Mac computer/tv/entertainment system was brilliant. Although it took me a while to work out how to turn it on etc. I did find instructions afterwards. My own fault for not looking for them first.

There was a minibar/fridge, which was locked, presumably a key is needed from reception.

Bathroom was clean and modern with The White Company shower gel/handwash.

There was also an iron and ironing board in the room which was really handy.

The city centre is within walking distance and very easy to find. If you are travelling to Bristol Airport, take the Airport Flyer, which is around £6.

Checkout was quick, and a lot more friendlier.

I would reccommend Mint Hotels for a city stay. I am going to keep a lookout for any deals that they might have."
2547,WLSOND,2011-10-31,5.0,pleasant stay Nice modern hotel in a good location. 10 minute walk to the quayside or the Cabot centre. Free Wifi and an Imac in the room was a novelty.

Evening meal was very good we stayed on a evening meal and BB basis deal. Quite central to Bristol city centre.

Reception staff were pleasant and friendly, but it took some time to confirm my pre-paid B&B  
booking (they wanted me to pay for breakfast - fortunately I had printed confimation). Continental breakfast comprised the usual cereals, breads, croissant etc., but I was concerned to find the meats and cheese on an uncooled, uncovered slab.
The hotel is conveniently located and reasonably quiet (at least to the rear which is adjacent to a small park), but I just had the feeling that standards have slipped."
2551,AndyB850,2011-09-30,4.0,"Is this Hotel too popular? If you like a Hotel that you can feel at home in, this one ticks the box. There is Fine Dining, small Pub atmosphere with small screen and good service to rooms. If beige is your colour, the rooms are nice uncomplicated in decor - and not too compact. TV in room is also computer MAC - so you can Skype or facebook if you wish! Here is the not so good points: Parking is ten pounds a night and incredibly tight to park. Location is business area, so little in the way of immediate night life. Very very busy during the two nights I stayed and service at main desk is a little slow.. The rooms are quiet so you can relax. If you eat in the ""Fine Dining Restaurant"" you could be hungry afterwards (I suggest the bar and add more to the menu it is the same kitchen). I would definitely recommend this Hotel."

Each room has an apple mac PC with free internet to use, this doubles up as the TV and Music player. There is a large desk if you need to work, the room had a great amount of natural light and the bathroom had a large shower with toiletries and plently of towels. 

Wernt expecting that much from breakfast but we arrive to the largest selection I've ever seen, all types of cereal, toast, fruit, cheese. There was also a menu of cooked food to order. I had smoked salmon and scrambled eggs which were delicious, as I was in a rush I asked if there was any chance this could be made asap and the staff were all very friendly and ensured I was not late for my interview. 

Excellent, good location too only a 5-10 min walk into Bristol. Definately recommend!"

The room was lovely and althought the view wasn't great,  we didn't expect anything else being in a city!! The room had a computer and wifi which was useful.
The bar was quite expensive and so we went out rather than staying at the hotel for a drink. The food was good, but again, wasn't cheap!
The breakfast was great - a massive choice and plenty to eat. The waiter/waitresses were all very helpful and polite which was lovely.

So overall pretty well recommended !"
2557,Nikkily,2011-09-30,3.0,"'Just enough' Mint Hotel Bristol We stayed at the Mint Hotel on 15th and 16th September- the Hotel overall is very modern and clean but lacking in the 'final touches'.
We had a room for two but only one bathrobe was supplied also one tiny little bottle of shampoo was left in the bathroom for both of us!!!.
The tissue box was only topped up with a dozen or so new tissues (what's wrong with replacing with new).
The bottle inside the shower ( which i assumed was shampoo) was actually handwash.
And the real sting in the tail came when we were checking out - the hotel gives the impression that parking comes with the Hotel rate - but the cheerful man on the check out desk asked me if I had a car in the car park and when I told him I did he asked for ten pounds!!!
Mint still has a few things to learn about attention to detail."

This wasn't advertised when I booked it.  The location is fine and relatively close to local amenities.  The room was clean, but a little on the small side.  The bed was very soft, so didn't get much sleep.  Was initially given a room facing the dual carriageway out side, but was changed on request to a room on the highest floor facing the park at the back (nice and quiet).  The MAC computer was a nice touch, but the tiny remote was very fiddley.  The best thing about the hotel was the breakfast. It was well cooked and plenty of choice."

While the actual room was passable, the quality of service was sub standard whether it was cleaning, dining room or reception area.  The attitude of the mostly European staff was poor - for example the dining room waiters clearly thought they were beyond serving coffee and food and were incompetent and rude."

Bristol although a good location, is no where near as nice. We even plumped for a club room, but it really wasn't worth it, especially as the staff were unaware we had booked club, so none if the (limited) extras were either mentioned or ready.

However, on the transition to Mint Hotel I think many corners have been cut. I was thoroughly disappointed with my stay here. We had booked a dinner, taxi and breakfast package. On arrival we were told the restaurant was full and wouldn't be able to eat there. The room was dirty, small, smelly and dank. We did manage to get the taxi, what a miracle! Finally the next morning, we had to queue for breakfast for 10 minutes as half the restaurant was closed for some reason. Breakfast was bad with cold squidgy toast and not as much choice as stated on the menu. I would avoid this hotel and would certainly not recommend it!"
2571,johnnyc40,2011-08-31,4.0,"Great location on the waterfront Stayed at the Bristol because my wife had stayed there years earlier and enjoyed it. The location is superb. right on the waterfront and in a nice modern bustling area full of bars and restraunts. We actually ate in the hotel restraunt because the menu looked so good - a two course for around £15 or the full a la carte at around £10 - £15 for the mains. The quality was really good and there were quite a few non residents dining.
The room was bright and clean, could have done with a lick of paint in places though."

Perhaps the aircon could be a little quieter but no noise penetrated from the corridor. Don't come here to be wowed (unless the iMac computer come entertainment centre does it for you) but do appreciate a hugely competent hotel at a fair price in a reasonably central location.

We had an excellent room and we had a great experience there. You get a free Apple Mac in the room and internet which was fantastic. The hotel is near Bristol Temple Meads which is an ideal base to explore Bristol and Bath, which is what we did. Breakfast was very tasty and we had a fantastic time. Would definitely recommend to others."
2579,mgd123London,2011-07-31,4.0,Comfortable and relaxing Excellent service at breakfast and friendly staff at reception. Cooked breakfast presentation could have been slightly better with a garnish or something green perhaps. Apple tv and free wi-fi in room were great. Short walk into town and very close to Temple Meads station.
2580,TravellingBen,2011-07-31,4.0,"Great room - shame about gym Stayed here one night for business - overall very impressed with the room and facilities. Small room, but adequate for single traveller and very well designed. Walk in shower - no bath, but White Company amenities. Free wifi in hotel, room doesn't have tv but an iMac which was good for playing DVDs etc and you can surf web if no laptop. Air con in room was good. Breakfast in the morning was good quality - overall one of the nicest hotels stayed in of it's class for a while. Will definitely stay again next time in bristol. 

Only criticism was the fitness centre - was a small guest room with one bike, one treadmill and one multi-gym. No real floor space - there were two of us in there and all felt a bit too intimate trying to share machines. It was also 1,000,000 degrees in there - whether air con wasn't working I don't know but was like working out in a sauna. I don't think would bother with gym again - shame as so few hotels get gyms right now."
2581,Rod4178,2011-07-31,5.0,Great deal We took the package deal that included dinner and breakfast. The food at dinner was fantastic and our meal delicious. Breakfast was also substantial and very enjoyable. The rooms are compact but well appointed. They looked newly refurbished and were spotlessly clean. Staff were friendly and very helpful. We Would happily stay again.
2582,globalcitizen_1985,2011-06-30,3.0,"No idea why it's a four star hotel - more like a three star one I stayed here for a night to have a look round Bristol for the first time and also Bath, which is really close to Bristol. The location of the hotel is great for the latter as Temple Meads station is just a five minute walk away. But the hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the generally not so nice shops and pubs of the Broadgate and Cabot Circus areas and a good 20 minute walk from the Harbourside and Old Town and even longer from Park Street. This was a major pain as I like to come back to the hotel a few times while I'm staying at places to freshen up, dump shopping, change clothes and what have you. But the location of this hotel made all this quite impractical for me and I got plenty of exercise anyway walking up the hills in the city centre! I wish I'd researched the location properly before booking.

The main reason why I chose this hotel was because of the iMac in the room. What a great idea and all for free, as is the free wifi. I hadn't used an iMac before but found it easy to use.

My double room was small as was the bathroom but not much of an issue for one night. 
I slept like a log and you could hear a pin drop on that night I was there, and I think this was due to there being a lack of loud types on my floor. Like some other reviewers, I found no dressing gown for my use either, which was disappointing. Apart from the iMac and the White Company tolietries, I didn't find anything luxurious about the room at all.

Staff on reception were excellent - warm and professional.

I fell in love with Bristol - a vibrant and civilised city with an exciting mixture of the old and the new - and I'll be back but I doubt I'd be back at this hotel."
2583,jnjcoogee,2011-06-30,3.0,"Disappointed with this Mint Hotel (previously City Inn)! We had 2 nights at the Bristol Mint Hotel, our choice based on our great experience at the one in Manchester where we had stayed several times.  The package in Bristol included the room, plus 2 breakfasts and two dinners . We are experienced travellers so we are used to all sorts of hotel rooms...but we were disappointed that the room we were given was very compact, not really a room suitable for 2 people.  Like other reviewers of this hotel we found the room to be small...it was very ""crowded"" with furniture that took up the floor space, making it quite difficult to move around.  The bathroom too was tiny with limited space for our stuff.  Anyway, we didn't mind too much because the room is only to sleep in really. The hotel is close to the station, it has an OK breakfast, and is modern and clean.  What disappointed us was that to have the dinner which was part of the package, reservations were only available after 8pm each night. On the first night there were 3 ""mains"" on the menu...one was a liver dish so that was out...there was only one ""cod"" dish left...so all up that didn't leave much for us to choose from.  This must be a regular problem as the staff refused to remedy this for us.  When we tried to book a table for the second night, again there was nothing available until after 8pm!!  And the menu was the same menu as the first night.  We decided to cancel the package for the second night . There were some positives though...the bed was comfy, clean etc, and we appreciated having a minifridge and free internet/computer/TV.  It wasn't a hassle-free stay overall though and there was also an issue we had to sort out with our bill when we checked out.   At the end we were happy to leave, and we don't think we would stay here again or recommend it to our friends."
2584,stevekH1886TF,2010-09-30,5.0,Good value hotel Great value hotel. Ideal for business users as has i-mac system in every room. Our room seemed a bit small but nothing worth complaining about. Breakfast was very good. Hotel conveniently situated between Temple Meads station and town centre. Room overlooked busy main road but we could not hear any noise from it. Would stay here again. Note: When we stayed here we were told check-in time was 3:00pm and not the usual 2:00pm
2585,Welshwhinberry,2011-05-31,4.0,"Generally enjoyable We stayed here on a Friday night at the end of May.  At £99 for two, including an evening meal and a glass of champagne, it was very good value. We had been here before a few years ago when it was the City Inn; on that occasion, everything was OK, but it was very noisy.  Friday nights can be a problem with hen, stag parties etc. This time, improvements had been made to the windows, so that road noise had been eliminated and the corridors etc. seemed pretty quiet, too. The room was small and the bathroom was even smaller, but it had been designed very well and there was everything a guest would normally require. There was no bath, which I was slightly disappointed with.The TV was also small and flat-screened and seemed to have more channels than is usual in hotels of this kind. The beds were comfortable and we had a reasonably good night's sleep.
The best thing about our stay was the food in the evening. Although the meal had to be chosen from a fairly limited set menu, it was excellent.  The portions were quite small, but the food was rich and therefore filling. There was plenty of bread anyway, which was some of the nicest bread I've ever tasted. The champagne wasn't bad either, considering it was part of the deal! The only bad part was the coffee, which was awful, very bitter and strong.  I usually like strong coffee, but I couldn't drink any of that.
Unfortunately, we didn't think the breakfast was quite so good. We prefer a buffet style, where guests can choose what they want and how much or how little. This had to be ordered and brought by a waiter. It was OK, though disappointing after having such good food the previous evening. Again the coffee was undrinkable, but I had tea, just in case.
The staff were very nice and helpful; the waiters were unobstrusive, but responded to our requests when required.
We thought the £10 car park charge was excessive. We were only there from 7pm on Friday to 9am on Saturday; most city car parks are cheaper after 6pm and before 8am, so if we go there again, we'll park in a nearby car park at half the cost."
2586,TimManchester,2011-06-30,4.0,"Great for the price - and an improvement on our last stay I only gave this place one star last time we stayed in 2008 and in reading that review again I think I was maybe a little harsh.  Partner stays here often with work and is a fan, due in part to a perfect work location, and I didn't book it this time.  For the price though (£80) it is very good - our 5th floor room was spotlessly clean, the location is still great and the iMac, toiletries and excellent restaurant make it better than than much of the competition.  To expect better than this for the price is expecting too much - for example moaning about the size of the gym seems excessive.  Yes the bathroom is on the small size but it made me marvel at the design that allows an ironing board and iron to be provided - rather than complain that there was too little space.  Yes the mattress is a little on the soft side but we slept perfectly well.  We stayed on a Friday night and there was no sign of stag or hen parties and we avoided the £10 parking charge by just parking on street.   The restaurant was fully booked and obviously has a good local reputation.

I definately want to compare this with the Future Inn next time we are in Bristol but there were none of the mistakes encountered last time and objectively this is an excellent overall package for the price."
2587,Regaine,2011-06-30,5.0,"A Great Find I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel last week and I have got to say this was great.

Check in was great, the room was great, cleanliness was great and best of all I had an Apple computer in my room to work and play on.

The only negative with this whole stay was breakfast, which I felt could be improved upon as it was slow, clumsy and not enough of it, but the bits I did have once again were great.

Keep it up Mint Hotels, I will be back."
2588,dave_fo,2011-06-30,3.0,"Great but has a shocking gym Food was great and the staff were attentive. Main issue for me was the shocking gym, not at all what the website described. If you arent the least bit interested in a gym then its great. If the gym is important then avoid: its just a room with a few machines, there were 4 of us in there at one point and it was way too cramped."
2589,LeopardLx,2011-03-31,3.0,"Faded Designer Hotel As car drivers passing through, we found the Mint well located, with free and safe overnight parking along the road behind.
Reception staff were extremely friendly and efficient.
The room to the rear (as requested) was quiet, small and a little tatty; finishes and furnishings were no doubt modern and up-to date some years ago. Needless to say the mattress was quite saggy. The bathroom was extremely compact with unpredictable plumbing, but clean enough. Our mirror was heated to a finger-scorching temperature.
We had dinner in the restaurant, which was excellent in terms of food and service.
All-in-all a reasonable place for tired visitors on a one-night drive-through city stay."
2590,MoleAdventures,2011-06-30,3.0,"Good but not great Rooms are pretty small but well appointed with decent desk space, lighting and an Apple iMac. The bathroom was incredibly small with a reasonable shower but no bath. Not too noisy. The room just felt cramped - things were cleverly arranged but the limited space got a bit wearing. Good if you're not likely to spend much time in the room at all. Great location for the Employment Tribunal in the Crescent Centre and walking distance from the station. Decent breakfast with standard fare. Room service menu hugely overpriced for portion size and quality but City Bar is very good. Helpful and efficient staff. Probably best for one night, no more."
2591,JFT7,2011-06-30,4.0,"Clean, quiet, modern, good breakfast & attentive staff - what more do you need? If you're looking for a hotel in Bristol that has attentive staff, exceptionally clean (and quiet) rooms, and a good hearty breakfast - then come here!

My only criticism is that the shower temperature was intermittent and almost scalding at one point! Apart from that, no complaints!"
2592,Slatters,2011-05-31,4.0,"Budget Designer A breath of fresh air at the budget end of the market. Clean, modern design in the rooms with the accents all on gray and white. Even the toiletries are by The White Company, and there's a white iMac in every room (great for the free internet, slightly fiddly to use as a TV). Proves that budget rooms don't have to be fusty. Beds were slightly on the soft side for me, and the cheapo sausages in the cooked breakfast were a bit nasty, but otherwise very few negatives to report. 
Short walking distance from Bristol's quayside entertainment district. But beware Bristol on a Saturday night - you can't budge for hen and stag dos, all slaughtered, and the hotel was full of them too. Had to move from our first room as it was obvious the neighbouring rooms were full of stag-doers, so it was clearly going to be a noisy night. Staff were happy to accommodate us in this, however, so that's fine. 
Hotel parking is limited and not free, but the nearby carpark is very cheap so that's not a major problem either."
2593,veritate,2011-06-30,3.0,"Too many expensive extras This was my third stay at this hotel.  I booked it because it was reasonably well-placed and I find the rooms comfortable and well-equipped, although small, and in the past it has offered reasonable value for money.  However it has become increasingly noticeable that things like breakfast and parking which were once included in a reasonable-all in price are now added on as expensive extras.  Breakfast, in particular, simply is not worth what is charged for it here.  The room service menu is also expensive and there is an eye-watering ""tray charge"" in the small print which increases prices even more.  I have decided that for future visits to Bristol I will be looking elsewhere."
2594,bs0ele,2011-06-30,4.0,"A super base for a city break Our room was clean and bright and the bathroom was spotless. The extra technological features included with the room were great and were easy to use. Being able to use the internet and check emails in the room was a definite bonus. The staff were polite, professional and friendly. We plan to come back to this hotel when we are looking for somewhere to stay in Bristol."
2595,Catherine_Essex,2011-06-30,2.0,"Not impressed really I needed to stay one night in a hotel close to Temple Meads train station as I didn't have a car and needed to get to and from the station without huge taxi fares so I picked this.

But across the road from the station is a new Holiday Inn Express which has breakfast included and next time I am going to stay there.

The Mint hotel is about a 10 min walk from the station (turn right out of the station and around various roundabouts). It looks like a converted office building from the outside. You can't see it from the station in case you are looking!

Reception: this was good - very friendly and efficient.

The room: I had read the reviews beforehand so I knew it was going to be small but the bathroom was suffocatingly small. I had to put down the toilet seat so that I could put my clothes somewhere and then wedge myself into the shower without hitting myself on the sink. The promised dressing gown was missing and only one large towel provided. It was a relief to get out of the bathroom. Can't room service provided two large towels and the promised bathrobe?

The room itself was too small with an addition of a table and chair as well as a desk and chair just to make it feel really cramped. The bed was low and uncomfortable. I didn't like the Apple TV as I found I had to wave the remote control around to change channels and there were no film options. I did read that reception had an extensive range of DVDs so I went down but she didn't have any (so why mention it in the room guide?)

I paid £85 for the night without breakfast so it wasn't worth the money in my view. The only good point was the free WiFi so I could use my iphone to keep me entertained!"
2596,stetay76,2011-05-31,3.0,"A poor representation of the Mint brand I needed a last minute hotel in Bristol and, having stayed at their hotel in Westminster a number of times, trusted the Mint Hotel brand - especially as their website told a heart-wrenching story about how the Mint brand was born in Bristol and this hotel was their home, etc.

How disappointing. The hotel itself - from reception to the room - is barely beyond a Premier Inn, save for the presence of the iMac. Restaurant was good, through service was hopeless on several levels.

Disappointing, and I wouldn't return."
2597,PuellaF,2011-06-30,3.0,"More like a three star than four star establishment We stayed here for one night whilst visiting a relative.  We had a friendly greeting and didn't have to queue to obtain our room keys (of the plastic credit card sort).  Although we could have paid to park outside the hotel for £10.00 for 24 hours, we parked overnight for free in the NCP car park at the back of the hotel, and then £1.50 for all-day parking near the SS Great Britain on the floating harbour.  The hotel is right in the centre of town and good for reaching the local amenities. 

The bedroom was generally clean with the exception of the keyboard for the Imac which was filthy.  The bed, whilst larger than the UK king size, had a very hard mattress and fairly flat, lifeless pillows, so that we didn't have a comfortable sleep at all.  The bedlinen was stained and old and the thin undersheet/mattress protector was so creased that it could not possibly have been straightened from the previous occupant.  This I found most offputting and I hope that the hotel takes note! 

The bathroom was clean but tired: the tap on the sink was very stained and old and the nozzle on the ""free"" soap flew off every time we pressed down the plunger.  Only one towel between two of us was provided but at least the water pressure in the shower was strong and perfectly acceptable.  

Breakfast in the morning was produced in the City Cafe and distinctly average and disappointing.  My partners' ""Full English breakfast"" barely covered the centre of the plate and was tasteless and my muesli was mediocre in the extreme.   Next time we visit Bristol we will certainly be looking at other establishments before this one."
2598,numbermonkey,2011-04-30,4.0,"Good hotel for the price - real shame about breakfast though The Mint Hotel is, all in all, quite nice.  Beds were fine (a little small perhaps?) and everything was very clean.  Staff are excellent.  It's a short walk to the city centre, shopping area and train station.  Just two points to raise - not all that important for the stay - just to be aware of:

- Our room had an i-Mac on a desk - inkeeping with a fairly trendy, minimalist, white room - but this is also your TV, so it's not comfortable for lying on the bed with a partner to watch TV as it's all at an angle.  Of course, I didn't come to Bristol to watch TV, so not a huge issue.

- A much bigger issue is the breakfast.  Hotels like the Mint make breakfasts for up to hundred people (maybe more) each day, every day.  So why are they so bad?  The meat in the fried breakfast was really poor quality.  The coffee was awful.  Absolutely awful.  But most importantly, we were tempted to eat there on our second evening and the breakfast put us off.  

Anyway - good value and reasonably nice.  Sort out your breakfasts and we may come back."
2599,mmmmcupcake,2011-05-31,4.0,"Clean, modern and affordable This hotel was clean and modern. We had a dinner, bed and breakfast deal for £99 for a night which was a good deal. You had to choose from a set menu, which was limited but was very nice. The rooms were clean and well equipped with the little things that some hotels do not have, in saying this the bathrooms are very small.
The beds are ok and they pretty much do what they say on the tin. Not the most central hotel but within walking distance of the town centre.
All in all a nice stay, they do charge £10 for overnight parking, but there is a little car park just opposite which charges £1 so would advise parking there. 
Free internet also included in the price which is a must nowadays"
2600,PhoebeHuddersfield,2011-05-31,4.0,"A good value choice Good standard hotel for the prices charged (£79 B&B on spring break package) The rooms are cleans and with the usual i mac system which is always good. A few niggles such as the mini bar did not open and there were no dressing gowns provided as advertised, plus we got a complimentary bottle of wine in with the rate for early booking but there was no cork screw, so we had to go to reception, then the bar, then the restaurant to get one. Breakast is nice but not work the £15 pp price tag if it is not in with the rate. Saturday morning at 8.30am all was calm but on the sunday morning at 10.30 things were a little more hectic with a lack of attention to customer service and a lot of dirty plates left on tables. 

The hotel is well placed, around 15 mins walk either way to the harbourside or Cabot Circus. 

Overall, this Mint is a little below the standard of the others in the chain, but it is older, and it still provides a good standard of accomodation for the price and i would stay there again if returning to Bristol."
2601,captnkirk,2011-04-30,4.0,"Good Hotel Good location Stayed at the Mint because it had car parking and was near Temple Meads rail Station for a trip to Bath. It is a nice hotel about 5 minutes from Temple Meads and 15 minutes walk from the harbour and restaurants or by bus with a bus stop just outside for buses to the shopping centre or the harbour or Clifton suspension bridge. Rooms fairly compact but nicely decorated and fully equipped with fridge, coffee/tea maker, good bathroom and comfy bed. Enjoyed our stay. Only downside was the parking was expensive at £10 a night."
2602,ChrisandRobUK,2011-05-31,4.0,"Comfortable, clean, great service, on-site carpark but over-priced breakfast We stopped here for a Saturday night as we were attending a friend's birthday in Bristol. I had booked the room several months earlier on a 'Spring Break' package and so the room and full cooked breakfast were included for £79. It was also a pleasant surprise to find a complimentary bottle of wine in the room as part of the package.

The room was comfortable, clean and bright - if a little small. This didn't matter to us though as we were only staying one night. A previous guest had been kind enough to leave us their chewing gum on the end of the headboard and it's shame that this wasn't removed by housekeeping. The bed was comfortable and we got a good night's sleep. The window does open wider if you manually release the catch but we preferred to have the air-con on as it was quieter. The iMac and free wifi were a nice touch and very useful.

The breakfast was OK but I would've been unhappy if I'd had to pay the full price (£14.95) for it! The bacon was inedible and looked reconstituted. Tea, coffee and toast were hot and tasty though.

The service from the staff and the front desk and from the waiting staff at breakfast was great - very polite and helpful with the few queries that I had.

The location was good for Cabot Circus and is in an area where there are lots of offices - a fair walk to the city centre most of the nightlife. If you're happy to get a taxi then it's not an issue :-) 

The car park was £10 for 24 hours but I didn't think that was bad to have the car just outside the front door. We were able to leave the car there whilst we popped to Cabot Circus the next morning which was a great help."
2603,Unders51,2011-05-31,5.0,"Highly recommended Easy to find the hotel which is about a 10 minuye walk from the pubs & clubs. The car park is a bit of a rip-off at a £10 per night. 
Staff were very friendly and helpful with quite a few British workers employed. 
The rooms were slightly on the small side but very clean. Only negative point was that the shower was a dribble most of the time with water actually stoppig on occasions on our last morning. They did offer to move us but we were about to check out anyway. They did say that there were water works being carried out in the area, but having spoken to other guests they were not experiencing the same problem 
The Apple Imac entertainment system was very good with fast internet and Sky Sports! Regarding the food we booked  this stay as part of a meal deal so a 2 course evening meal was include. This was beautiful food, slightly small in size but cooked to a very good standard. 
Breakfast was cold buffet help yourself or order s full English from the waiter which was very good. They seemed to of sorted bthe problem with the tea & toast as it came out just before the hot breakfast. 
All in all a lovely stay in the Mint and we will defintely be returning again soon."
2604,GrayGlasgow,2011-04-30,2.0,"too noisy and tiny rooms......smallest bathroom in the world? Stayed here for a sat and sun night recently with my wife as we were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary.  Booked the mint on tripadvisor reviews and price as was only using as a base to help us to explore Bath with a half day exploring Bristol penciled in also.  
The location was good for temple meads station which we used to get to Bath and airport bus but a bit of a walk into town.  We had previously stayed at the london city inn and liked the contemporary rooms and decent value but this place was way insuperior and i have also been in the bar of the glasgow city inn and again this place didnt seem to match up.  I asked for a nice room in advance and we were given only 1 floor up looking out onto the heads of the smokers from the bar so was noisy and was woken at 4am on the sun morning by a stag doo returning.  It felt no more than a fresher premier inn to be honest, the noisy fire doors in the corridors also kept us awake.  Went for a drink in the hotel du vin on one of the nights and wished we maybe should have opted for there but i know it was a bit more cash but prob worth it.  We only got 1 towel changed over even though we left 2 in the shower which was annoying.  My wife thought she had ruined her dress from the iron as it kept leaking, i almost burned a shirt as the base had someone elses melted top on it......replace the £3 plastic irons with decent ones!
I liked Bristol & really liked Bath which was a shame as the accomodation didnt match up.  If we ever return to this neck of the woods again i think wel opt for a Bath guesthouse"

In an earlier review I singled out the reception team for their good humour and professionalism.  Well, I rang them up and asked for a copy.  No problem.  Within a few minutes - after a bit of sensible and polite security checking -  they had emailed it to me. I will always stay there on business if I can.  Thank you Annamaria!"

The bed was uncomfortable. It's hard to explain but lets just say it has little to no firmness or support. Parking is challenging since there is only a small lot in the front of the hotel and cost is around 10GBP.  Breakfast was good but the coffee and toast were very slow to arrive to our table. We had the continental which was around 11GBP. The hotel is only a 10 min walk to the harbor."
2607,Ben83,2011-03-31,4.0,"Nice Hotel Reasonably Well Positioned I stayed here for one night on Saturday & booked last minute, I got a rate of £44 room only which was excellent value for money (additional £8 for on site parking) the room & bathroom, although on the same small side, were very clean & modern and had everything you'd expect from a good quality chain hotel. It wasn't noisy either as some hotels are in city centres at weekends."
2608,Johnnycash72,2011-03-31,5.0,Excellent hotel - fantastic value for money Stayed at the Mint Hotel for one night and am just about to book a couple more nights there for April.  Great rooms and fantastic value for money.  Modern and clean.  iMac TV is a nice touch.  It is small but then it's right in the centre of the City.  Walking distance from everything.  Great reception staff too.  Very helpful.  Plus plenty of parking spaces which was a bonus.  Highly recommended.
2609,Traveller78,2011-03-31,5.0,"Good modern easy to get to hotel with very helpful and friendly staff Mint Hotel Bristol

My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights at the end of March for a bed and breakfast birthday break.  We arrived by train at Bristol Temple Meads railway station and walked for seven minutes along an easy route to arrive at the hotel.

We arrived early afternoon, before the 15:00 check-in time, yet the very helpful and friendly reception staff checked us in without any fuss.  A room at the rear of the hotel was requested, which over looks a small park, as the front rooms overlook a busy dual carriageway.  I did get to look around a room on the front of the hotel and noticed that the window was treble glazed, and almost no road noise came through.  However, being treble glazed it was not possible to open the window, unlike the opening double glazed ones we had at the rear of the hotel.

The first impression upon entering the room was as to how small the room was, and the shower toilet washroom was the second smallest I have ever seen in a hotel.  Yet the washroom worked very well and was a pleasure to use.  The toiletries were of a very high standard, being from The White Company.  There is no bath, but the shower worked well..  The room had all the usual things you would want, a big safe to fit a laptop into, mini bar, ironing board, iron, hair dryer, coat hangers, and the large bed was very comfortable.  The TV was an iMac, which had free access to the internet, with a built in DVD player.  The very stylish telephone was by Jacob Jenson, the designer behind many Bang and Olufsen products.  We slid the small coffee table under a dressing unit, and pushed one of the two chairs against a window, then the room had more space and was more usable.   The air con worked well and was silent unless the fastest fan speed was selected. 

Breakfast was very nice with very helpful and friendly staff serving.  We were able to eat all that we would want.  Fruit juices, cereals, rolls, yoghurts, cheeses, fruits, rolls jams etc, were on offer at tables   However, for the cooked breakfast a waiter takes your order from a menu and it is brought out to you soon afterwards.  I do prefer a breakfast where you go up and help yourself to hot food from a counter.   One bad point is that on both days we had a long delay between between ordering tea and coffee and it arriving on our table.  In fact the hot breakfast food came first on both days.  It is nice to be able to drink coffee or tea fairly soon after sitting down at a table, and before cooked food arrives.

We did not take dinner in the hotel, so cannot say what it is like.  We walked the fifteen minutes or so into town to eat out.  At the rear of the hotel is a small park with a ruined church in it, and at the end of the park is a small Italian restaurant called Marcos Olive Branch.  We had a very nice midday snack there.  Down stairs there are a small number of soft chairs to relax in or upstairs there is a more formal dinning area.

We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would return again.  It is not a large old sprawling hotel, it is more of a very clean modern, and functional hotel.  The good points are; It is close to the train station, shops, and docks area, has free internet use on the room iMac TV, and all staff encountered were very helpful."
2610,DellaDancer,2011-03-31,3.0,"Pleasant but food is very expensive and very small portions Overall my stay was good, the rooms are nicely fitted and comfortable and for the most part the staff are very pleasant.  The only downside of my stay was the feeling that I was being ripped off at dinner.  They have a dish of the day - fresh market produce - on one day this was whole plaice - sounds good - when it arrived I was amazed that any fisherman would keep such a small plaice - approx 15cm long and 10cm across.  I think it may have been a Dab, not a plaice.  This was served with a tiny bowl of salad for £13.50.  Extras - such as chips would cost an extra £3.95.  My company had booked  the room including dinner.  I suggest you stay there but eat elsewhere."
2611,pudsontour,2011-03-31,4.0,"Very good budget city hotel. We wanted a good budget city  hotel and found it! The room was a bit small but it was clean and comfy and the shower was great. Shame there is no bath but what do you expect for the price and location. 
The food is great and the service at reception and in the cafe is very good, in fact other supposedly luxury hotels could learn a thing or two about how to make guests feel welcome from the staff we encountered.
We booked through the Mint website and got a good deal."
2612,Albermarle,2011-03-31,4.0,"Does what it says on the tin 'Does what it says on the tin' is a jokey English expression that means the hotel was exactly as described in the brochure. Contemporary white/beige/brown decoration and furnishings . Room clean and modern with IMac entertainment system ( not for the technophobic though ) . Bathroom the same with powerful shower . 
Good service in bar and for breakfast; did not eat in the restaraunt.
Takes about 10 minutes to walk to city centre .
OK for business and leisure although in typical city hotel fashion the rooms are not large and not much room to spread out with double occupancy 
Car park ( £8 a night ) is inadequate and had to wait for someone else to move their car to be able to get out ."

Food is consistently good at  all meal times. Friendly effiecient staff members. Brilliant deal for free over night parking when hotel car park is full.

Having an iMac for a your entertainment system is so wonderfull, just need to find a place to plug in my iphone and the world is complete."
2614,orak100,2011-02-28,5.0,Mint indeed We just decided to visit Bristol for a weekend and tried the Mint after reading the reviews here.  We were not disappointed.  A very comfortable room at reasonable a price.  And the food from the Cafe is fantastic.  We had it in our room and it was delivered with great service.  I can't think of anything bad about this hotel.
2615,charlie1410,2011-02-28,5.0,"Pleasant stay Expected to turn up to a basic budget city hotel and to be fair it is however, after getting over the disappointment at the size of the room, lack of an opening window and a weekend without a bath, things began to get better. Partner really liked having access to Mac I sampled the shower and found it to be one of the best I have experienced, went for dinner in City Cafe first impressions really good, service very efficient, food delicious in very nice surroundings.Not such a good nights sleep room next door had their air conditioning on and it roared like a lion all night. Breakfast was hot and to a high standard service once again very efficient.Great nights sleep second night. Had a late check out which was very nice. Overall our stay was very enjoyable we were very impressed with the staff, all very pleasant a great service, had a great weekend, we would definitely stay again."

2617,jonnysdonny,2011-02-28,5.0,"Absolutely no chintz here! Clean, crisp, modern - yet so friendly ! We found The Mint  hotel  to be spotlessly clean with very friendly, helpful staff.  Our room was facing the road behind the hotel and whilst there was no view it was extremely peaceful. The bed was very comfy with nice pillows. The bathroom was also spotless with a brilliant shower and lovely toileteries (no need to take shower gel, there's a lovely big White Co pump for your use)and lovely fluffy white towels too -Yes- the rooms are a little on the small side compared to other chains eg- Marriott/ Hilton etc but what you lose in square footage you gain on the welcome you recieve- without exeption the staff were excellent.  The food in the restaurant was excellent too - (delicious home made bread), but don't expect big portions! The only downside is the typically hotel-expensive prices for drinks and restaurant meals but If you are averse to chintz and want a modern hotel this is for you."
2618,ScotDj,2011-02-28,4.0,"Good hotel, good location, good services Stayed here for Sat/Sun nights 12/13 Feb, check in was very efficient with staff explaining services available.

We were allocated a room at the end of the corridor which has a service cupboard behind it, although it didn't cause any disturbance to us there were a couple of occasions where people were rumaging around that could have woken you up had you been asleep.

The rooms are very well laid out however a little on the small side, with bathrooms only having a shower this may be a downside for some.

The iMac entertainment system is really good and the free wifi throughout is great considering how much some hotels rip you off for.

We ate in the bar on the Sunday night and the food was very nice, staff were very attentive and helpful, and the prices fairly reasonable.

There was differences in the breakfast depending on the day of the week, Sunday morning breakfast was good, with a fairly standard selection of cooked items available to order and the usual continental affair.  We arrived towards the end of the breakfast serving and some stocks were starting to run low/out which is not particularly great given the 4 star plus rating the hotel aspires to on it's own website.

Monday was a different affair with a much larger selection of items including kippers, haddock, smoked salmon & scrambled eggs also a lot better quality food as well.

We managed to get the B&B rate for £68/night for 2 which was pretty good value given that cooked breakfast is £14.95 each if not taken in advance.

All in all a good stay at a nice hotel with some good options at no extra cost."
2619,Phenoc,2011-02-28,5.0,"can't wait to come back A lovely hotel, great location close to the centre of the city. Service is good, car park charge £8 per day, minibar, 'fitness room', room service, late residents bar, comfy bed and White Company toiletries.

Each room has an Apple Mac with Apple TV.  It is well located being only 5 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads station.  The car park is very small and the spaces are too close together.  Food is of a reasonable level too although sometimes the wait at breakfast can be quite long but at least the food is freshly cooked rather than sitting under hot lamps for hours.  Fitness centre is a big disappointment but can be used at a push if you need that exercise fix."
2621,Slenny,2010-04-30,4.0,"Great Hotel in Lovely Bristol Stayed here for 2 nights over a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The hotel is located in the business district close to Temple Meads station so on a weekend the area was nice and quiet. The centre of Bristol can be reached easily in 15mins by taking a leisurely stroll along the river.

The hotel itself is nice and modern and the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. Tea/coffee making facilities are provided and the TV doubles as an iMac with free internet connection which is great.

The restaurant and bar area is very nice and the food in the restaurant is good. Breakfast was also good and plentiful. All the staff in the hotel were helpful and friendly, would definately stay here aagain."
2622,smokeyrolo,2010-11-30,4.0,"great location, great rooms If you are like me and like the good things in life but don't really have a budget to match then try Mint hotels (formerly City Inn).  If you book far enough in advance, as I do most of the time, some very competitive rates can be had.  This hotel in Bristol (I have stayed with Mint in other cities) has the best location for me, just a few minutes stroll from Temple Meads stn and a few minutes stroll from Cabot Circus you are in the heart of Bristol.  No need for expensive cab fares, everything is within easy walking distance.

The rooms are to a very high standard of comfort, cleanliness and facilities.  My favourite being the Apple imac entertainment system. With free wifi and computer access, you couldn't ask for more.  The bed is so comfortable you really do not want to get up in the morning but then knowing you have an amazing buffet and cooked breakfast waiting for you, i can just manage it. That is if I can prize myself out of the amazing power shower (White company, London, hair and body wash provided).

Mint hotels are my personal favourite brand and I always look forward to my next visit."
2623,Dinos43,2010-12-31,4.0,"A conveniently located modern hotel which offered excellent value We both thought that the Mint Hotel offered exceptional value for our 3 night B&B stay. It was only a five minute walk from Temple Meads station and ten minutes from the main shopping/tourist areas. The hotel is reasonably modern, clean and bright with a pleasant dining area and bar. All of the staff we met were friendly and helpful. The breakfasts offered reasonable choice in both English and continental versions and we certainly wouldn't quibble given the price.   The room was of reasonable size, comfortable and well equipped; the free computer/internet access was a bonus. 
We would certainly stay here again."
2624,timpaws,2010-12-31,4.0,"Smart choice for Temple Meads - particularly for cyclists! A last minute change to travel arrangements due to appalling weather conditions found me booked in at the Mint, less than five minutes walk from Temple Meads station. I opted for Mint because I'd dined (well) here on a previous business trip. Check-in was hampered by 'the computers being very slow at this time of day', reception staff were very professional and charming though. The restaurant was completely booked by a party so the hotel had lifted the tray charge for room service - which seemed reasonable for a solo traveller but I'd have been disappointed to dine in my room otherwise. The room was however very well styled, Mac TV and slick facilities. Catering was exceptionally good and good value, highly recommend.

Breakfast was buffet-style for a wide range of cold options and a very good cooked breakfast to order. Check-out was seriously delayed due to a huge group of cyclists (complete with bikes) clogging up reception for 20 minutes. Reception staff were, again, very apologetic, however, unless this group turned up on spec - which seems unlikely - can't help but feel that the hotel management was remiss in not making advance arrangements for checkout. Subject to group bookings, and the hotel's ability to manage them, I'd have no reservation in staying again."

2628,supermidwife,2010-11-30,1.0,"glorified travel inn with faulty lift! On first appearances the hotel seemed clean and comfortable. it was ruined by uninterested staff with limited social skills. the location is nowhere near any of the bars/restaurants/tourist areas.
Do not use the lifts if anyone else is in there. there we 8 of us in a lift that stated maximum capacity of 13. After becoming stuck in the hot, confined space, we buzzed the emergency bell for 15 mins and the door opened. Expecting concerned staff i was dismayed to hear the only thing said was ""it was overloaded"" by a sullen member of staff to her colleague. myself and another lady had become very distressed being stuck in a confined space and this was the last thing we expected to hear. i would have gone back to the room for a cup of tea, however there were only 2 regular teabags for our two night stay. Everything seemed to be in a strange place, we never did discover where the hairdryer was! the room was hot and it was very noisy. 
We were charged for breakfast which we had not had. they also attempted to charge us for two days car parking when we had only used the car park for one day.
I wouldn't waste your money and stick with the budget hotels (unless you specifically want two in one shamppo and conditioner form the white company!)"

2630,herrdoktorc,2010-10-31,5.0,"(almost) Always a pleasure Another return to the City Inn and after a fairly hellish journey to Bristol the quiet calm of the hotel and courteous attention of the staff was exactly what I needed.  The location is great for walking from the station (although that means it's probably not very well located for any onward business meetings).

Check-in was fast and my request for a quiet high-floor room had been taken to heart - I don't think I could have been higher or further from the lifts :-)

My room was a bit warm when I arrived, with the air conditioning running and the window open (grr, what a waste of electricity!). That was soon fixed by closing the window and secondary glazing fully (cutting out all of the noise from Temple Way) and letting the air conditioning do its job.  The dials on the air conditioning unit seemed a bit strange, almost as though they wouldn't work, but despite that I was able to change all the settings I needed to.  (The system reset at about 8.50 in the morning, so you might want to bear that in mind if you intend to sleep in.)

I always seem to have a strange experience with the restaurant's maitre d' and yet again was met with the ""have you booked a table"" and much working-out-if-there's-room, despite the fact that for the duration of dinner about half of the restaurant was empty. Once seated the waiting staff were attentive and the food from the Garden Menu was lovely (and an absolute bargain)

Unfortunately the WiFi network had a problem for the duration of my stay (network was up, wasn't giving out IP addresses) so I wasn't able to get online to do a couple of bits of work. Not a massive problem, but annoying as the free WiFi is one of the reasons I stay at City Inn for business trips.

My room was clean, shower was nice and powerful, bed was comfy (though yet again I suffer my ""one and a half pillow"" problem).  Was VERY pleasantly surprised to find a power socket next to the bed, practically unheard of in modern hotels and makes having my iPhone next to the bed (for the alarm) possible. Well done City Inn - it would be nice to have this in ALL of your hotels.

Breakfast service was prompt and the food delicious, though I wish there had been some background music playing as the room felt very strange (and too quiet for many to want to talk).

Fast and efficient check-out and surprisingly no credit card slip to be stapled to the bill. I definitely like that!"

it was relly amazing.... the food was very reasonably priced with a range of things to offer...

Tip  If you arrive by train Temple Mead,  Bypass the main exit go past the booking office and  out of that exit straight across the carpark past the motorcycle park and you will come to a small complex of shops pass them go left past Weatherspoons and that road takes you opposite the City Inn This all takes less than 5 mins.

The cooked breakfast was made to order so was fresh, and there was a good choice of cereals, pastries and fresh fruit. All staff were extremely friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble.

Saturday night (our last night) was the worst, when we were virtually ignored by the 4 waiting staff, even when the main rush of diners had gone. Breakfast service is ok as long as you don't mind having your cooked breakfast arrive before you've finished eating your cereals. On the plus side, quality of food has been excellent and room is clean (but was only made up for one person rather than two on day of arrival, and why winter weight duvet in summer?). Until today would have recommended now only with reservations."

On site parking was another bonus. I loved my stay at the City Inn."
2642,Dribbs,2010-08-31,3.0,"Needs a re-brand For anyone who has enjoyed a stay at any of the other City Inn sites, this will be a real let down.  If City Inn don't do anyhting to improve it, they need to re-brand to City Inn Express as the hotel has more in common with a holiday inn express.

The building itself looks more like an office block, as does the reception area, no sense at all of the syle you'd get from the other bracnhes of City Inn.  The bar and also the breakfast room have more in common with a no frills chain.  

It's the little things that work well for city inn, lovely table settngs, great breakfasts, care over the way things look, service, good wi-fi and the great city inn style. All of this was missing, the only little thing about this branch was the bedrooms. 

I'm a massive fan of city inn and very loyal to them,  but this was not at all close to the standard they normally set, a real let down."
2643,philra,2010-08-31,5.0,"Clean, friendly, functional The City Inn Bristol is a good priced city centre business type hotel. Breakfast was freshly made as opposed to a buffet style, which are often dry and unappetising. The free i-mac in the room is a nice touch, but double as the tv so you have to prioritise! Clean rooms, no noise (eg slamming doors) and friendly staff. Good location 5 minutes from Temple Meads Station, and also 10 minutes walk from the Bristol Harbourside, reasaurants bars etc. very handy for a day out in Bath. Station staff also very helpful!"
2644,AlanKLeeds,2010-08-31,4.0,"Cherish Manuel The City Inn is like a superior travel inn. Rooms are small but well laid out, and the I-Mac in every room for TV, free internet, DVDs from reception and more is a great touch.  What makes the hotel special is the evening meal - great imaginative food and great service. If you are lucky to have Manuel as your server, he'll turn a great meal into a special occasion. Tip to City Inn - cherish Manuel, he's probably your greatest asset. The downside during our latest stay was a very average breakfast with average service - I don't expect to have to ask for butter, marmalade (but they'd run out) and have items missing / not replaced."
2645,Pinky2283,2010-08-31,2.0,"The City Inn Ethos Doesn´t Travel Well Having stayed at the company´s flagship hotel in Westminister, I didn´t think twice about booking for my stay in Bristol.....wish I had.   You can just about live with the space saving in Westminster (which was considerably more), because you are getting a great deal, and top quality service in the heart of London- but the size of the rooms in Bristol is just ridiculous.   It was virtually impossible to fit a food tray through the door!!  The bathroom, again is claustrophobic, and you can barely sit down on the toilet! 

Also, I noticed that the fittings in the Bristol hotel were preety shoddy.  With some of the chrome plated bathroom fittings crumbling off.   Just didn´t give off any sense of quality.  Yes, the Imac with free internet, and a broad range of sat channels is a great idea, but on it´s own is not a reason to book here.  The food was reasonable, although the room service menu doesn´t compare to their Westminster hotel.  The staff are not a patch on their Westminster hotel either. 

I was generally dissapointed,  and glad to get out of this broom cupboard of a room. The windows in my room were terrible as well- with only one opening, that you could open literally two inches- which defintiely added to the general sense of claustophobia.
 
I don´t think it´s unreasonable to expect the same standard as their Westminster hotel.  The price of the land should be cheaper in Bristol, so why scrimp even more on space??  

Location is perfect for business travellers being so close to the station, but far from perfect for people wanting to explore the leisure attractions."

2647,mariannelynton,2010-08-31,5.0,"Consistently good Fantastic hotel, stayed here several times and will always recommend it for anyone staying in Bristol. The hotel is modern with some fantastic facilities and features including an iMac in every room with free internet, TV, radio and a DVD/CD player. The rooms are comfy and clean with great touches like White Company toiletries, robe and proper hairdryer. There's parking on site which is unusual for a city centre hotel and it costs £8 for an overnight stay. The room rate I got from Travel Republic was the best out there and was the only one to include breakfast."
2648,JPM21,2010-08-11,4.0,"Very good hotel, very friendly staff Very pleasant hotel, surprisingly quiet bearing in mind it's location and size.  Staff were excellent, nothing was too much trouble. It's within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants. Breakfast was a bit steep though!"
2649,Neisar,2010-07-31,4.0,"Very nice, convenient and very friendly. We have stayed in The City Inn, Birmingham several times so knew exactly what to expect and to be honest we think this one is better than the one in Birmingham.

The rooms are perfect for a one or two night break, not huge but plenty of storage, very clean and everything we needed was there. We had a room on the first floor, normally I prefer much higher due to noise issues but our room faced the rear and it was so quiet and peaceful, even for me a very light sleeper and with the Harbour festival going on.

Breakfast was very good, we went down at 09.30 and they were running out of some of the rolls etc but feel sure as they were servisng until 11 they would of been replenished. 

What made this stay nicer than Birmingham? The service. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient and gave us our rooms even though we arrived early (expecting to just be able to leave our bags and go off into Bristol) with no problemjs whatsoever. No pressure to leave a credit card on the booking for any extras. 
The staff in the dining room for breakfast were extremely friendly and helpful, really pleasant. We had pre booked and paid for breakfast in our package but our room numbers were not on the list for inclusive breakfast and none of us had our slips - that was no problem whatsoever, they took our room number and we had breakfast and no grief when checking out with any extras. This has happened to us several times over the years and everytime we have had to explain more than once we have paid and have even had issues when checking out so it was a refreshing change to find that we had no issues here.

The hotel is a very easy 4 to 5 minute walk from Bristol temple Meads Sattion and about 10 minutes or so to Cabots Circus etc.

Yes I would stay here again, well done City Inn for helping us have a fab weekend in Bristol and keep up the good work."
2650,Colin041,2010-07-31,5.0,"Fantastic stay My wife and I had a fantastic time there, with great staff, food and accommodation, and with such an amazing location - it has to be the best in the area. The Imac and free (and fast) wifi were especially welcome."
2651,cltboy,2010-07-31,4.0,No suprises We found teh hotel very much as advertiied.  We found the staff efficient and were very helpful.  The rooms are not the biggest  but are clean and the imac is a nice touch.  For thos not staying on business and on a budget there are several places you can have breakfast in Victoria street or in the business park opposite there is a Wetherspoons which is open for breakfast 7 days a wekk and a Starbucks.  The hotel is around 500 yards from The railway station and a similar distance to Victoria Bridge.  The actual centre of town is a littel further.
2652,unheardof,2010-07-31,5.0,"A delightful surprise, awesome quality and stunning value This has to be my find of the year. 

Tucked away in a not too fashionable part of Bristol this hotel has nice sized rooms, with elegant modern furnishings, iMac entertainment centres in each room, blistering wifi and a superb restaurant with a great wine list. Add to that helpful friendly staff and price under £100 for B&B if you pre book and I doubt you could do better anywhere in Bristol.

They have a couple of other locations as well which i will definitely try"
2653,Big_Boots_10,2009-08-31,3.0,"A disappointing stay in a usually good hotel I have being staying in City Inns since they opened and go back time and time again as they are stylish, comfortable, have great restaurants and the service is always good. However, this trip to Bristol’s City Inn was a real disappointment. When we arrived we waited 20 minutes to be checked in, not because they were busy but because the two members of staff on the front desk had no idea of what they were doing. On top of their incompetence they were being rude to the customers. We were given a disabled room. We were not asked if that would be Ok, in fact it wasn’t as I am partially sighted and I kept banging into things in the bathroom and went home with several bruises. When I asked about changing rooms I was told that was not possible. This hotel does not have a great location but normally I would be glad to overcook this because the hotel and service are so good. This time I felt that the poor location, problems in the room and the unhelpful staff spoilt the trip. I still stay in City Inn Hotels in other cities but in Bristol I have now switched to an alternative with a better location and friendlier staff."
2654,neilyork,2010-06-30,5.0,"The way all business-traveller orientated hotels should be.. The City Inn Bristol was recommended to me by a colleague, knowing how appreciative I am of good business facilities.  He wasn't wrong!  Before I go into specifics, this hotel is fabulous for business travellers.  It doesn't have the swimming pool you never have time to use, what it does have is some of the smartest technology in any hotel I have ever stayed at in the whole world.  I'm an Apple fan, so this place was bound to please and I was gobsmacked to walk in to my room to see that it actually did have a fully functioning Mac!  You can get TV, DVD, hotel information and obviously the Internet!  I even had a skype call with my fiance!
The hotel itself is a little walk from the City Centre and the car park is small - it was full when I arrived so I had to park elsewhere until later in the evening.  The hotel also charges £8 per day to park your car, even whilst staying as a guest.
The room itself is very modern and had a fully stocked mini bar (many hotels don't do this anymore, so plus points here to City Inn).  In addition to the Mac desktop, all of the hotel provides free wifi (Marriott take note!) which worked flawlessly.
Air Conditioning in the room is powerful so kept me cool on what was a very hot day.  The bathroom was small but functional with shower that seemed to either spray hot or cold and not warm!
I took breakfast in the hotel and it was cooked to order with a wide (but not huge) selection of items.  
Overall, for £75 per night, this is a stunning hotel for business travellers.  The City Inn concept has clearly had a lot of thought put in to it and the rewards are there to see - at the time of writing this hotel ranked 6 of all hotels in Bristol.  It's a breath of fresh air in Bristol - I've tried most of the hotels here and they're all awful apart from City Inn.  From a cost/benefit point of view, this is without doubt the best hotel in Bristol.  I cannot rate it highly enough.  All of the other hotels in Bristol are a very poor second when compared to City Inn."
2655,Dinkyenjoyinglife,2010-06-30,4.0,"OK, some disappointments but would give it another go I'd stayed in City Inn  Glasgow before and been very impressed so was expecting big things. I have to admit to being just a bit disappointed this time.

On the plus side, the location is fine - 5 minutes walk from the station, 10 minutes to restaurants and shops. The City Inn philosophy seems to be to offer luxury standard at cheaper prices by skimping on the room sizes and location rather than on service levels as other budget chains do. Therefore, the room was very nicely furnished. It wasn't spectacular though. - maybe that's because this hotel is over 10 years old now and others have now caught it up. The room was also very small - fine for just 1 person & their stuff but I think it may have been a bit cramped if Mrs D had been in tow on this trip. Although there was air-con, it was a bit noisy and rattly. One undisputedlty nice touch though was the I-Mac in each room with free wi-fi.

The restuarant food was good but service not brilliant which let it down a bit. We also had some problems with the air-con and Wi-Fi not working in the meeting rooms which the reception staff tried their best to fix but again these problems spoiled the overall impression a bit."
2656,PeenutsUk,2010-06-30,5.0,"Super find In Bristol there are many hotels to choose from, however the Cityinn gets the balance right between the price, comfort of nthe room and service.

I had a nice room with aircon and the restaurant was very good if a little pricey, breakfast was first rate and all the staff were nice and all for £89"
2657,thebumisher,2010-06-30,4.0,"Bright, comfortable and clean Arrived early, couldn't check in, but was allowed to keep car in car park. Room was very nice with good air conditioning, big comfortable bed and a very nice shower. 
The only downside was getting woken up at 6:30am by loud music. We reported this to reception who came to our door to tell us they couldn't find the source, but they could hear the noise from inside our room. So, they went off again and the music stopped shortly afterwards."
2658,1khuws,2009-12-31,5.0,"Contemporary Hotel - Good Location Very friendly staff, helpful and always keen to please. The hotel provides good information about the locality and even will recommend a restaurant depending on your tastes even though the City Cafe provides ""Egon Ronay"" style and quality food.

I have recommended the hotel to several people and brought a party of 30 to stay there, all of whom thoroughly enjoyed themselves."

2660,Gillz79,2010-03-31,5.0,"Home from home for 3 months! I've just returned from 3 months staying mid week with work in the City Inn Bristol and would recommend for anyone working in the city longterm.  The rooms are basic but provide everything you could need for a comfortable stay.  The iMac TV/Computer is excellent for evening viewing, internet access and watching dvd's with a selection available from reception.

I had a broken showerhead in one room and reported it when leaving for work, reception checked if I minded someone being in my room during the day and on the return from work it was fixed, no issues!

The staff are friendly and helpful and when staying for a long period of time make you feel very welcome and valued as a guest.

As I flew home every weekend I left a holdall behind the reception with toilettries and items I didn't need to carry home and back, the staff were more than happy to help with this.

The restaurant, lounge bar and room service menus offer a vast selection and if there is something you fancy from the lounge menu while in the restaurant they will make it for you without any issue.

The hotel is an ideal location, come out the back door and through Temple Gardens, turn right and within 5min you are at the waterfront bars and restaurants or keep walking and another 5min and you are in the centre with Cabot Circus shopping centre, cinema and food halls.

We travelled to work from Templemeads train station and again the hotel couldn't have been handier, the station is literally out the front door cross the lights and cut through the square - 4 min!

I'd definately stay at the City Inn again and recommend to friends and colleagues, I even got 2 bottles of wine as a thank you for staying 25nights!"

Baby alarm worked from 1st floor bedroom to the restaurant and bar."
2663,Darlox,2010-04-30,3.0,"Functional short-stay hotel near downtown Bristol - nice but nothing special The City Inn Bristol is a contemporary-styled hotel with a few interesting perks, but generally seems to straddle the line between value and function.  Travelers able to obtain a good rate will likely be happy with their stay, but at prevailing hotel rates, most visitors would likely be happier in one of the larger chain hotels.  Read on for more...

LOCATION:
  The City Inn is located on Temple Way, on the east side of downtown Bristol, very near the Temple Circus roundabout.  The hotel is within easy walking distance for guests arriving by train at Bristol Temple Meads station (~5-10 minutes max), and also within easy walking distance of the key shopping and dining areas of downtown Bristol.

PROPERTY:
  The hotel is a rather dormitory-like 4 story building, decorated in an Art Deco motif, and feeling somewhat institutional upon first entry.  The hotel is clearly geared towards business travelers, though it seems to try and loosen up a bit on the weekends with happy hour specials and other perks in the lobby-level restaurant/bar.  Rooms on the front side of the building directly abut onto Temple Way - a busy 4-lane thoroughfare, so road noise is a bit of an issue.  Rooms on the rear side overlook Temple Gardens, a small park situated between the hotel and the neighborhoods surrounding the river where most shopping and eating can be found.

ROOMS:
  The rooms are actually a bit larger than can usually be expected from UK business hotels.  The room had a small bar-service area near the entrance, a large king-sized bed, a work desk, and an armchair with table.  A new iMac in the room doubled as both a functional Internet-connected computer, as well as the television for the room.  Unfortunately, the spaciousness of the room did not extend to the bathroom, which was quite tiny.  The sink is a corner-unit to save space, and the shower is a small 3'x3' cubicle with an ingenious fold-in door, which is necessary since opening the shower door into the bathroom would be impossible due to the size of the room.  However, water pressure was great and there was an ample supply of hot water in both the mornings and evenings, so it was serviceable.  The Inn offers room rates that include breakfast -- though unless you have to eat at the hotel for reasons of time or lack of transportation, there's ample opportunities for better, less expensive breakfasts nearby.

AMENITIES:
  There is free wired and wireless Internet access in all guest rooms.  The hotel's modern restaurant offered 3 meals a day, including a ""Market Lunch"" which offered a seasonal selection of items for dine-in or take away.  The bar was geared toward an extensive wine list, though was comprehensive in its offerings.  The prices for ala carte items in both the bar and restaurant seemed a bit excessive, though there were good-deal price-fixe options for both dinner and lunch that would be good value.  Most visitors will likely want to wander into the riverside neighborhoods for meals, though as other guests have mentioned, the walk through un-lit Temple Gardens can be a bit unnerving after dark.  Visitors arriving by car will likely have a gamble ahead of them, as the parking available on-property is simply a narrow strip of concrete along the face of the hotel -- available at about 8 GBP per day.  Those unlucky enough to get locked-out of the on-property lot will have to use the nearby municipal parking garage.  On the positive side, the garage is free until 8 AM -- but on the negative side, daylight parking is charged for at a normal downtown scale, so hotel guests leaving their car behind may face a significant parking bill for their stay.

STAFF:
  The staff were helpful and efficient, with a reasonable knowledge of the surrounding area, and a willingness to help organize local transportation and dining.  We didn't interact much with the staff, but the property seems to be well-run.

Overall our stay at the City Inn was pleasant, and for the price paid, we got great value in downtown Bristol.  Rates seem to vary significantly from day-to-day, so most visitors will want to shop around a bit.  At a rate of around 65 GBP, this hotel is inexpensive for its location, but with midweek rates that can exceed 100 GBP per night, it doesn't have the atmosphere, comfort or perks that you'll find in other major UK or international chains.  But if a good rate is available, most travelers will be pleased with a short stay at the City Inn."
2664,collegefield,2010-05-31,3.0,"Looking a bit tired. A good breakfast. I had stayed at this hotel a few years ago and really loved it. Sad to see that it has been left to go a little tatty now with our room at least being scattered with stains and dents. You don't expect the earth for £79 a night but it now has the air of a slightly more stylish Danish travelodge than a 4 star hotel. 

Check in on the Saturday was fine - We were allowed to check in a little early in fact. The addition of Imac to the room I thought was quite a nice touch as were nice sized wine glasses. Just disappointed to find hairs in the bathroom and the stains etc.

Slept really well - The bed was comfortable. I did find a really long grey hair in my bed. I am bald so it wasn't mine! Maybe Crystal Carrington had been staying? 

Very good breakfast and nice that it is served until 11am on a Sunday. £8 car parking which seems reasonable for a city centre hotel. 

Saying that I would head for Brasserie Blanc down the road or the brick house instead of eating at the restaurant as it was not that cheap. 

I would go back but only on a laterooms £60 deal or similar. Recommend with a health warning."
2665,dell_boy10,2010-03-31,4.0,Good FUnctional Hotel Used as a stop off on the way to Cornwall. Agree with others about the parking but otherwise a pleasant stay.
2666,GloucesterUK,2010-04-30,3.0,"NOTHING SPECIAL Have stayed at a number of different hotels in Bristol and having seen this a  rated No.2 in Bristol recently thought would give it a try. Reception and rooms fine. Imac and PC with free intrenet access. Standard rooms fine for business stay but bathrooms pretty small. Without clever shower door there would be no room to swing proverbial cat. Clean, functional and modern. Without aircon room very stuffy but with aircon very noisy and difficult to sleep. Breakfast was pretty sparse and very slow. 45 mins to get a cooked breakfast and when it came the scrambled egg & bacon, & smoked salmon and scrambled egg looked pretty suspect - ? powdered egg? Overall fine for the price but nothing special and will try a few other places next time."
2667,communque,2010-04-30,4.0,"Good rooms, bad parking, ok location... We stayed here for 1 night and were not overly impressed with this hotel. The rooms are compact and modern and the imac is handy.  However, the parking is tight and the car park was completely full when we arrived.  We dropped off the bags and asked reception what our options with the car were.  They suggested that we use the NCP cark park nearby which we would have to pay for.  As we were about to move the car, a space became free and we ended up parking on the hotel site.  However, the next day I just so happened to notice that street parking is free on Sundays yet this wasn't suggested to us by the hotel staff!  Being in a foreign city these things are not always obvious, and any helpful advice such as this would have been greatly received.
 
We didn’t fancy the walk through the unlit park in the evening to get to the restaurants and bars and so we ate in the restaurant downstairs. I ordered vegetable lasagne which arrived as layers of carrots and beetroot without any of the usual features such as tomato sauce and cheese!  They charged us ?10 for this, which was the size of a starter without anything on the side.  My Italian girlfriend was insulted that they could actually call this lasagne!"
2668,foresight50,2010-04-30,5.0,"Hard to beat at the price First impression of the location is a little unexciting - surrounded by modern offices blocks.  However it is only a short walk to major shopping/eating areas.  Cut through the old churchyard at the back of the hotel into Victoria St and turn right. 

Friendly and efficient check-in. Room spotlessly clean, on the small side but lacks for nothing.  Comfy bed.No decent lighting for reading in bed - but that is the case with most hotels nowadays.  iMac and free internet in the room is brilliant, especially if, like me, you strongly object to most UK hotels and their pay-for-broadband policies. Also gives an excellent TV picture.
Car parking in the street is free(plenty of space)  between 6pm and 8am and all day Sunday, so you can avoid the hotel car park charge if the timing fits.  
Cooked breakfast was better than the usual  standard - it is not a buffet, so the fill-your-plate types may be disappointed but it is freshly prepared and of good quality. It meant I could safely choose scrambled egg without risking getting that watery, lumpy stuff beloved by so many hotels across the country. Coffee not bad at all (again a nice change).
One gets the impression that the management  is making a serious effort  to get things right and the staff seem cheerful, friendly and eager to please."
2669,ika_66,2010-04-30,5.0,"Great hotel, nothing bad to point We spent 1 night and were very pleased with the hotel even if I wasn't expecting a lot regarding the price we paid (£55 for 1 night including 2 breakfasts).

We arrived a bit early (1pm) but we could check in (in few minutes) and access the room immediately !

Room was perfectly clean, bright, confortable and pleasant (overlooking Novotel, the other side is maybe less pleasant as overlooking a busy road). Bed was confortable and we were not disturbed by any noise.

Nice details in the bathroom: good pressure shower, nice toiletries.

We were surprised to find an Imac in our room with a free access to internet anytime and access to TV/radio. Its definitly a plus !
Kettle and ironing table (we didn't use but looked in good condition).

We used the room service on easter evening. Food was delivered in 30 min, it was good and price was reasonable. (see my review for the restaurant which is great). Breakfast was delicious, a real pleasure. There is a buffet with pastries, fresh juices, fresh yogurt, cereals and you can order full english breakfast, salmon or anything on the nice menu. It was well cook and staff was pleasant and helpful.

Great stay and would definitly go back to this hotel and recommend it to my friends. Very good value for money and can't find anything faulty."
2670,AnnJo19,2010-03-31,4.0,A pleastant stay in a convenient location Overall a very good stay.  The Apple Mac in the room was fantastic!  Rooms were small but very adequate.  Parking was £8 for a 24 hour period which stung a little.  Breakfast was disappointing.  We waited nearly ten minutes to be asked if we wanted tea or coffee or whether we were having continental or full English.  We wanted Full English but as the service was slow we didn't think we could spare the time so opted for the continental.   The selection was limited.
2671,CityExplorers,2010-03-31,4.0,Overall good value for money Does exactly what it says on the tin! Good hotel in a good location.
2672,Lambsy_10,2009-07-31,5.0,"A smart, modern hotel in the centre of Bristol We stayed at the City Inn for one night last July as we were flying on holiday from Bristol airport the next day.  The hotel is very new and contemporary, it has it's own private free car park which is great (subject to availability as it's not very big).  The rooms are very clean and all have an Apple iMac  which our 8 year old daughter absolutely loved!  We were lucky enough to have a room facing the back of the hotel which overlooks a park and was nice and quiet (the front of the hotel faces a very busy road so may be noisy)  The staff were very efficient and friendly and the continental breakfast was wonderful with lovely fresh fruit salad, yummy pastries etc.  We got a good deal on the room, around £50 for the three of us including breakfast. We were asked if we wanted the continental breakfast or a cooked breakfast, we thought that we would have to pay extra for a cooked breakfast so we stuck with the continental, but we heard other people being told they could choose a full English if they didn't want the continental at no extra cost so we were slightly disappointed as myself and my husband would have opted for the full English had we known! . It's well situated for visiting the city, just a short stroll and you're in the centre.  We had a very pleasant stay and would definitely use this hotel again if we were in Bristol."
2673,judiDurham,2010-03-31,5.0,"outstanding service I travel on average 4 nights per week  and have recently starting using the City Inn chain. The rooms are clean, functional, with comfortable beds and they certainly meet their description of contemporary. I like the open approach to dining i.e no fussiness with bookings etc and the food is of a very good standard.
This week I had service that went the extra mile - I got into a taxi at Temple Mead Station in Bristol to be told by the driver that the hotel was a 5 minute walk. His directions were not good and when the 5 minutes stretched to 15, I called the hotel for more details. Within a  couple of minutes one of the duty receptionists had come out, scouted around, found me and escorted me the last 1000 yards to the hotel and helped me with my luggage. Now that is service."

The rooms are suiprisingly chic, facilities of high standard, and the service is very proffesional as well as personable. 
Breakfast was very good.
Beds a little soft and pillows a little flat.
We will be back and have already reccomended to others"
2676,Storm_Claws,2010-02-28,5.0,"Great Hotel. Helpful staff, great food and comfortable bed all at a very fair price. This is a great Hotel. The staff are really helpful and friendly. A few examples: 1) Dealing with my personal breakfast requirement. 2) advising me on great dishes to try and supporting wines. 3) Putting a large desk into my room so I can work at a desk in the evening. This attention to my requirements make this a good hotel, but the very friendly nature of the staff and a smile turns this hotel into a great hotel for me.

Location: The hotel is located within a few minutes of the train station and on a good route in and out of the city towards the M32 and M4 or A4 towards Bath if traveling by car. The hotel is also situated near a number of good pubs and restaurants that are no more than 5-10 minutes away. (It took me about 10minutes to get to the city center.) I particularly liked the Seven Stars pub (CAMRA Pub) - 1, Thomas Lane Redcliffe, Bristol, Bristol, BS1 6JG. The hotel is also only 10 mins from the new big shopping arcade called Cabot Circle, and well worth a visit.

Hotel Restaurant: The food here is very good. It is well worth finding out what the dish of the day is too. The bread in the evening is home made and is excellent. As mentioned earlier they will go that extra mile for you. For example I wanted gratin dauphinois potatoes and the chef cooked it specially for me, to go with my beef. I have also tried the bar food and this was very good value and good too, I would recommend the sausage and mash which came with the best onion gravy I have ever had.

Parking: The only minor downside for the hotel is that it does not have the largest of car parks, and seems to have had a number of very poor drivers who do not know how to park in a single parking space. But I have never not been able to park at the hotel. 

Facilities: There is a small gym here, but I do not use that. There is FREE Wi-Fi and an apple I-mac computer in your room. This for me the icing on the cake, normally hotel make you pay a fortune to use their Wi-Fi service. The I-mac computer is great (and modern too), it also has many TV channels, including sky sport 1,2,3 and many many other channels (Some that I have never even heard of before). This is great since I know if I am staying here I will not need to bring my own laptop as there is a computer with good bandwidth to use in the room that will meet all my needs. I love using this computer and being able to write emails to friends and watch the TV all on the same screen, like I am doing now. 

I have already recommend this hotel to my work colleagues and plan on staying here again when I visit Bristol again on business or pleasure."
2677,MichaelDinwoodie,2010-01-31,5.0,"Perfect for the discerning business traveller who doesn't want to pay over the odds Being a man who spends a lot of time on the road (3 nights a week), I cannot commend this hotel enough. I stumbled upon this hotel by chance a few years ago, and have since gone on to stay at the Bristol venue well over 50 times and have frequented the London, Birmingham and Manchester locations as well. What I love about the chain is it does the simple things very well, and doesn't try to shaft the customer in the process. Not content with providing free wifi (Which at some hotels can be £15 for 24hrs) they also provide the computer, and not just any old PC but a iMac in every room. This iMac doubles as a TV with a great  array of channels, including Sky Sports, Film Four etc No need to pay for overpriced in room movies, as at front desk they have a current and varied array of DVDs to borrow at no cost. Staff are welcoming and friendly. But the icing on the cake for me is the food. Despite travelling on the companies Visa it still grates me when I am forced to pay £15 for a fatty burger and fries, plus a £4 tray charge. At the City Inn they recruit exciting chefs, cooking a seasonal contemporary menu. This menu can be ordered straight to your room, £16.95 for 3 course - fantastic value and always a joy. After a hard days work, its one of the few places I look forward to heading to and feels like home from home. Have got several of my colleagues using it and the feeling is mutual. Can't recommend it more."

Getting our main meal at night was a bit of a chore took almost 1 1/2 hours to be served main meal and menu choice was poor especially for a business client who travels alot and wants some home comfort food  . The only let down in the whole stay"
2679,ChristineWMaidenhead,2010-01-31,5.0,"Excellent hotel in Bristol Just stayed at the City Inn Bristol and was very impressed with the quality of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff. The hotel is very conveniently located near to the train station and close to all the bars and shops.
All the staff were really welcoming and seemed genuinely interested in looking after their guests. We booked a room with breakfast and I can certainly recommend the breakfast, they even do bubble and squeak.
Would go back again"
2680,boingzeb,2009-12-31,5.0,"Very Modern Hotel We booked for it's good value New Year's Eve package that included dinner and brunch. The hotel was OK to find, had to put a different address in the sat-nav, as it is on a dual carriageway so no chance to stop if lost.  We arrived early as had seen on previous reviews the car park is small but it was half empty when we got there. Only a five-minute walk to Cabot Circus and the other shops so that was good. Room was a little small than I've come to expect in hotels but it has everything you need including ironing board in the wardrobe, dressing gowns and a safe. The imac is a brilliant idea as it is TV/stereo/computer, the free internet is great and even better as I don't take a laptop with me, so great to be able to use the internet in a hotel for once. The food in restaurant is fabulous, we had a five-course dinner and a three-course brunch with some really interesting food, although the service can be a bit slow. Something horrific must have happened in the kitchen in the morning as was waiting for nearly half an hour to be served. The staff were all really friendly even when they were having a disaster. Would come again and would go the others in the chain."
2681,fernwater1234,2009-12-31,4.0,"Good business hotel Good position between Temple Mead station and Cabot Circus , 5 minutes walk either way. limited car parking (£8/day) and small ncp very close. We had a 5th floor rear room which was quite with nice views .
Once you get over the shock of how small the bedroom and shower room is you realise everything is modern,well laid out and practical to use .Comfortable beds and an i mac for tv and internet use. Breakfast buffet limited but a cooked to order service available. Had dinner in the restaurant one evening , food reasonably priced and good quality with friendly service that could be a bit more polished. Overall a good business hotel , not sure about leisure as for a Saturday night I felt £124 for double incl. breakfast was a bit on the high side."
2682,AnneFMcG,2009-11-30,4.0,"Pleasant hotel that's good value for money Stayed at the City Inn whilst visiting friends in Bristol one weekend.  The hotel is in a good, quiet location very close to Temple Meads railway station and is a good base for exploring Bristol.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  They seemed to know the area well and were happy to provide information about the city.

The double room was spotless and perfectly adequate. The iMac offering a good selection of TV channels and free internet access was a nice touch.  The shower was much more powerful than ones I have encountered previously in hotels in this price bracket, although the ensuite bathroom was rather cosy.

Only real gripe was that service was seriously slow in the bar.  On a Friday evening at 6pm we had to wait an age for cocktails and on returning to the hotel at around 10.30pm on a Friday night there was no-one behind the bar. There was only one member of staff in the bar and she appeared to be flitting between the bar and the restaurant.

The cooked breakfast was good and there was a decent continental selection.

Overall, I'd say this is a good place to stay that's better than bigger chains who offer rooms at similar prices in the city.  I'd be happy to stay here again when next in Bristol or to use other branches."
2683,whizzylaw,2009-11-30,5.0,"Reliable,  good quality hospitality with friendly and efficient service Regularly using various hotels for business stays, City Inn has never disappointed - and Bristol's City Inn has consistently provided good value accommodation in clean and comfortable surroundings.

Good  (free) broadband facilities and pleasant food, situated in a convenient spot for central Bristol / Temple Meads.Far outclasses the competition!"

2686,CharlesPlymouth_UK,2009-10-31,2.0,"If you are disabled and want to be constantly reminded stay here! There is a very bad culture in this hotel concerning the needs of the disabled almost to the point of active discrimination. The staff are untrained in such matters and the practices in this hotel concerning parking and constant blocking of corridors constantly reminds you that you are not welcome unless you are fit.The staff flounce off if you ask them to do anything.OK we got an apology from the manager by email but he couldnt even get our names right. Check in was a mess as well, wrong room type and left hanging around for a looooong time.  Shame as its otherwise a nice hotel. Staff need re training!!"
2687,I_love_the_red_sea,2009-10-31,5.0,"Immaculate Rooms, Friendly Service and a Delightful Restaurant... Having stayed numerous times in various Bristol city centre hotels, the City Inn stands out by far... The devil is in the details and this hotel has certainly taken care to ensure they have got them covered.  The staff are very friendly yet professional.

The bedroom was immaculate, the bed is very comfortable and the room had great views over the park with free Internet access and an imac in the room... there is very little else one could ask for...

The restaurant always has a great selection for breakfast and the evening menu is varied on a regular basis. It has a lovely ambience and very well presented dishes. 

The only thing i could fault is the spaces in the car park... as with all cities the spaces are very narrow."
2688,Rodthedog,2009-03-31,5.0,"A hotel of this quality should be much more expensive!! I highly recommended this hotel to a colleague the other day and realised that I had never got around to posting a review on TA. I stayed for eight days B & B whilst working at Bristol airport in March. I selected the City Inn on the strength of the good reviews and my expectations were exceeded. The room was modern, stylish and spotless. (I agree with a recent review that I had the impression of being the first person to stay in the room.) I loved the I-mac (Free TV/Radio/Music/unlimited internet access all-in-one). If I'd known what an I-mac was beforehand I wouldn't have taken my laptop!  The staff I interacted with, at check-in, the breakfast staff, the bar steward, to the maid who kept my room so immaculate, they were all without exception, very polite and friendly. Whilst waiting for my colleague at a seating area in reception one afternoon, even the manager, who introduced himself as Angus, asked if I was staying in the hotel, was I enjoying my stay, and if I wasn't completely satisfied with the service and facilities, and should I have any problems or complaints, to ask for him personally. I have rarely encountered such a high level of personal service in a hotel of this size. Considering I had to be away from home for over a week, I found it a proper home from home.
The central location of the hotel is good and is pretty easy to find. It is about a 5/10 min walk from the train station, and about a 5/10 walk to Corn St, King St or the waterfront (more bars, restaurants and clubs than you can shake a stick at). Parking is limited, but on the odd occasion I couldn't find a space, there is a reasonably priced pay and display right behind the hotel. As for a review saying the spaces are tight in the hotel carpark, I was driving the work's Honda Accord Estate which is a big beast, and I didn't have too much trouble!
Overall, I was extremely impressed with the hotel and surprised that it wasn't far more expensive. I look forward to staying there, or hotels in the same chain in other cities, in the future."
2689,Ken-Jayne,2009-10-31,5.0,"Liked it! Booked through Laterooms for a two night Sat/Sun weekend shopping break - very pleased with price (room only). Used this hotel chain in Bristol and Birmingham and we've enjoyed our visits. Room in Bristol was small, but immaculate."
2690,Aussie_Nick,2009-09-30,3.0,"Comfortable stay Stayed here for the night for business purposes.
Quite a comfortable stay, good tv service and free wifi.

Dinner was pretty pricey for what you get, but breakfast was amazing (I had room service for both so not sure what the restuarant/bar was like)."
2691,fussydeedee,2009-09-30,5.0,"Would stay again I am quite fussy when it comes to hotels, especially when it looks nice on the outside, only to be let down by the quality of the rooms.  However, from the inside out, this hotel was brilliant.   The hotel is located within 10mins walking distance of Bristol's shopping centre.  There is parking (which is limited) on site.  This is £8 per 24 hrs.  However, if you are at the hotel during the weekend, it is free to park on the side street on a Sunday.

The hotel has 5 floors with a bar and restaurant.  We asked to stay on the 5th floor so we couldn't hear the noise from the main road.  The rooms are spacious with apple macs in every room, giving you free access to the internet, which is a bonus.  The rooms and bathroom were both very clean.  We had breakfast twice there.  You can choose from an English breakfast, continental or both.  Could not complain as the standard of food was very good.

The receptionist made us feel very welcome.  No complaints at all and I would stay there again."
2692,bluesouris,2009-09-30,5.0,"Lesson in how to get the details right... Despite being part of a chain, this hotel illustrates exactly what a hotel experience should be about. Fundamentally, when I walk into a hotel room I should feel like I am the first person to stay in that room. That all the fixtures and fittings are intact and the bathroom and furnishings are clean and finished to a high standard. I have access to all the information from the local area and what most hotels charge as extras such as Internet Access are included in the price. When I have a problem, I am dealt with courteously and professionally by the hotel staff and that my stay in the hotel is uneventful so I can free to experience the place I am visiting and not have an experience at the place I am staying.

This Hotel has the details exactly right for a budget to intermediate traveller expecting a good standard of service and stay. Want more? Pay more - get less."
2693,JezFerg,2009-09-30,3.0,"The worlds tightest carpark Stayed for 3 nights. The hotel kind of grew on me the longer I was into my stay.
I think it was obvious that all the staff, from the reception to the bar and restaurant and house duties, are being stretched to breaking point, but who can honestly say it's any different at the place where they're working at the moment. 
The things I really liked where the rooms, location, fitness room, bar tender - he actually greeted with me using my name throughout the stay; I've never known this anywhere else I've stayed.
The 2 things I didnt like were that the bedding ie the duvet and pillows smelt a bit musty and should be replaced. And the carpark!!!!!! If you drive anything bigger than a dodgem car then you're gonna have fun here. And it costs £8 a day for the pleasure."
2694,munchkp,2009-03-31,3.0,"Nice city hotel Modern, clean, great location. A couple of staff were great, one not very friendly. No complaints about room at all. If anything the place was slightly souless but not dreadfully so. Generally no complaints and would use city inn, planning on using some of their other locations as well."
2695,Flams,2009-08-31,4.0,"Great hotel, shame about the service I truly enjoyed my stay at the City Inn but I have to say whilst they got most of the important things right, it was the little things that were missing. 

The big positives:

- The Macs in the room serving as a tv and internet access was inspired. Being a tech junkie I really enjoyed playing around with this piece of kit and I hope this is the way most hotels will move. 

- The comfort level of the hotel was exceptional, all the seats and beds were very comfy. 

- The location was close enough to the main train station and the nightlife to make our stay enjoyable. 

The Negative 

- The reception staff seemed bothered that they had to be there to help us, the gentleman who checked me in didn't smile once or even make conversation with me. However it must be said that the lady who checked me out and the gentleman who helped me with my bag were both much friendlier. 

- I was slightly annoyed that I wasn't offered the chance to leave a swipe of my credit card at reception meaning I couldn't order room service or eat breakfast at the hotel. Add to that the fact that my minibar was locked made me feel rather unwelcome. 

- Whilst the macs are excellent they are missing a couple of touches such as the programs not being fully installed on the computers, some programs crashing if another person in the hotel is using them and no tv guide/a minimalist remote meant I had to keep checking the internet to see what I could watch at night. 

I honestly think that I was just unlucky with the chap who checked me in as other members of staff I interacted with were full of smiles.

I would very much recommend the hotel for value for money and comfort, so give it a try I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself."
2696,ruth1980,2009-08-31,4.0,"Small but perfectly formed! I stayed at City Inn Bristol over the August Bank Holiday, and I travelled with 20 people, to celebrate my hen night. We chose City Inn as they had a £59 per room per night deal on, with breakfast included. The hotel was pretty easy to find, and is a short walk from the train station, and 10 minutes stroll into the city centre. 
The staff were fairly helpful, although some of the party found them a little snotty. (Although we were a hen party, we were not rowdy or loud, so I don't feel we were 'lowering the tone' so to speak!!)
The rooms were well appointed and spotlessly clean, but fairly small, Some friends had larger rooms with kings size beds for the same price, but I think it is just the luck of the draw. The beds were comfortable, and once we worked out the air conditioning, we had a goods nights sleep. As mentioned, the imac system was clever, but a little fiddly if you are used to PC's! The free internet is bonus however. 
The bathroom was tiny, and difficult to get ready/dry in, but the shower was great! 
The highlight for me was the breakfast. Although there is only a cold continental buffet, if you order from the kitchen, the food was lovely - I had smoked salmon, scrambled egg and brioche on the second morning, and the eggs were the best I've ever tasted! The service was friendly, but a bit hit and miss speed wise, so not great if you're in a hurry. The fresh pot of coffee and cute mini bagels were a bonus though!
Overall, a great stay for the price, but I wouldn't pay the normal £80-£100 for this, purely because the rooms are a bit on the small side! Oh, and the parking is not great - very small carpark and £8 per day! A bit cheeky for a 4* hotel I think! I'd definitely book again if they had the same deal on though, for the scrambled eggs if nothing else!"
2697,wolsty07,2009-08-31,4.0,"Great hotel in centre of Bristol and easy for airport We only stayed one night in the City in Bristol, as we were flying out from Bristol airport the next day.

It was a great hotel really close Bristol Train Station and therefore only minutes from the city centre shops/resturants etc. We were able to get a bus straight from the airport to the train station and back the next day in only 20 mins.

The hotel itself was really clean and the room was a good size with internet access free of charge in the room through the mac TV. 

By no means is this a boutique hotel but it is much better than your average travel lodge etc."
2698,Mikeparry,2009-08-31,5.0,"Great Hotel! We only stayed one night (overnight stop) so no much time to give a full review.
However, on entering the hotel the reception staf were extremely friendly, helpful & efficient.
Room very clean & well laid out. Bathroom very good.
iMac media centre a bit gimmicky. A bit of a nuisance if all you want to do is watch television.
Restaurant area (for breakfast) very light & airy. Again, extremely friendly (& jolly) staff. Very good breakfast."

Friendly reception on arrival but at 2.20pm it was too early to book in, but it was not a problem as they were happy to store our luggage until we returned later. We were given a map of the area and the receptionist took time to point out places of interest and where the shops and resturants were located.Efficent check in when we returned but when we reached the room found it had not been made up as a twin(which we had specificaly asked for ),but again not a problem as they immediately allocated us another room. My son was very pleased with the free Wifi and apple mac computer/'tv. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the room and bedding, modern decor, White House Toiletries and bathrobe. Excellent breakfast, lots of choice and they even made me hot chocolate. Would certainly go to this hotel again."

On checking in we found reception very efficient and extremely pleasant.  The room was  modern and in pristine condition.
Breakfast was excellent .  The bar and lounge areas very good.  Everything went towards making the weekend a great success.  I would recommend City Inn to anyone.

It was modern decor and very clean. The Apple mac in the room was fab, as well as the free wi-fi. It was within walking distance of the station and the city centre, without getting the Saturday night rowdiness you might get with a central hotel. 

They had a really great range of facilities, much better than, say, a Premier Inn/Travelodge, without being too fussy or overdone"
2703,Sains,2009-06-30,4.0,City break in Bristol We were welcomed at the reception desk in a promt and courteous manner.  We were advised that the car park charges were more than if we chose to park in a nearby car park which saved quite a bit.  The room was very clean and tidy and had recently been refurbished.  The bathroom was small but very good.  Internet access was free and available.  The main city centre is only 5-10 minutes walk.  A good location for a city break.
2704,simontaH3bR,2009-07-31,5.0,"Great little hotel - top value - would highly recommend Stayed here for two nights in July 2009 whilst in the area. Booked online via website for £59 each night based on great value, nice website and reviews on here!

Wasn't disappointed. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms have iMac computers with free Internet access and good TV/radio. Good location. But overall - great value for money!

Negatives - car park is very small (and very expensive) and the rooms are on the small side too (shower rooms are tiny).

Unfortunately, not sure if it's due to the price, but there were a lot of noisy drinkers in the hotel both late in the evening and in the early hours. I was awoken three times in the night by pissed guests rampaging through the corridors :("

The staff were always friendly and polite; they were also very accomodating.  The restaurant food was lovely and equally as nice when I had room service.
If I had any problems (which were very few) the staff arrived promptly to resolve the situation i.e. I couldnt get the internet to work.  Which by the way, there is internet service in each room along with TV, Sky, DVD and radio.
Very central to various amenities....train station 5 minutes walk and Cabot Circus is a 15 minute walk.  I would go back to this hotel."
2708,theredone,2009-04-30,3.0,"Bland but conveniently close to the railway station Not knowing the city at all and coming from the railway station, I at first hesitated whether I had the right address as the place seemed dominated by office buildings and the hotel blended well with the overall ""officy""-look of the area. The check inn had some problems, they took a while finding my reservation and I genuinely had trouble understanding the receptionist's accent. 

Nevertheless, going into the room I was impressed. It struck me as being very serene and clean if you can call it that. Very beige though. Looking through the cupboards and shelves I was impressed, there was plenty of space and it all seemed well thought through. The Mac computer doubling as the TV was a definate plus. I had booked the hotel only a few days ago as my whole trip came unexpectedly and staying in Bristol was a necessity as I had an early flight from the airport, so the ability to connect online was very welcome.

The view from the window was an office building - no surprise there. The bathroom was very clean and seemed functional enough. Very cramped though and the rail for the hand towel was directly above the toilet seat and somehow it also managed to fall into the toilet. 

Overall I was happy with the room, I got a good night's sleep and all was well. As my stay was really short, I valued the proximity to the railway station (about 200meters or so) and the nice bed. However, in the morning around 5am I had to catch the first bus to the airport and the receptionist took a really long time. Given that I had paid in advance and didn't use the minibar I had to rush him and he only then cleared me to go. Again, not something I would have even paid attention to had I been on a holiday and not in a hurry but given that I was on a business trip I would have valued efficiency in the reception."
2709,kissum,2009-05-31,5.0,"Loved it! They really went out of the way for us- when they saw us checking in with a three year old, they automatically brought us a nice cot. The free internet was a big plus. The staff was wonderful, and helped by looking up bus times for us as well.
I'd give the restraunt a pass if I were you, but everything else was amazing!
As others have said, the free internet was a plus. Clean, great location if you're taking a train in or a plane out, as they are a few minutes walk from the bus route and Temple Meads."
2710,curlycat,2009-05-31,4.0,"Excellent restaurant We stayed overnight at the City Inn, Bristol, on our way back from holiday and were very happy with our choice. The room was very compact, but had lots of nice extras. We very much enjoyed the flat screen TV/Apple Mac computer and all the bits and pieces in the room - snacks, mini bar, tea and coffee facilities etc. We very much appreciated the fruit platter in our room after a long journey. The bathroom had an excellent shower (no bath)and was very clean and modern. The only downsides were a slightly firm bed, only one bathrobe for 2 people and the small size of the room (+ the £8 parking charge!). The excellent feature for us was the cafe bar and the restaurant. Arriving mid-afternoon, we had a snack in the cafe bar (excellent) and then ate later in the restaurant. The restaurant meal, and service, was quite exceptional for a hotel of this kind and we enjoyed it very much. We would certainly choose this hotel again if staying in Bristol."

2712,Discover802847,2009-05-31,4.0,"Great room, great value  but panicked breakfast We found this hotel to be in a great location for the train station. It's in a business district but overlooks a park which is nice. We stayed here as hotels in Bath were too expensive  and managed to get a room at the City Inn and breakfast for £59 which was excellent value especially considering the hotel's impressive facilities. Our room had air con, a very good shower and an iMac system that you can watch TV on and use the internet for free. We liked the modern simple decor and found the bed really comfy. 

Incidentally, the lady on reception was exceptionally helpful!

The only negative about our stay was the breakfast. We had to queue to sit down and the service was rather harassed and panicky, we think maybe they were understaffed so this may have been an exception. The breakfast itself was very nice."
2713,dangermousetrip,2009-05-31,5.0,"Great location, clean rooms + iMac computer in room with free internet access! I am a solo traveller and paid under £60 for a room at City Inn Bristol and thought it was a fantastic value for money experience.

This hotel is literally under 5 minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station, making it a VERY convenient position. Also the Bristol airport 'International Flyer' is the only express link between Bristol Railway Station (Temple Meads), Bristol Bus Station, Clifton and Bristol International Airport. The journey time to the City Centre is approximately 30 minutes, so those with flights can also benefit.

Firstly the reception workers were very friendly and professional and my room was spotlessly clean. But what I found to be a massive plus point is that the room has a iMac entertainment system - this is your TV (with freeview channels), DVD player, radio but the big bonus of being a fully functional internet system - so if you either have time to kill or just need information, check emails, deal with ebay sales or even check facebook (!) then this is a fantastic bonus to have in your room and the surfing is free! Business people can also deal with files and save them to memory sticks and there are printing facilities available. The system also has iTunes if you need to use your CDs while working.
I know most people don't go to hotels to use computers, but personally when I've come back from an evening out, I am rarely ever wanting to go straight to sleep, or if I've got an hour before a meeting etc, having a free internet terminal in your own room is a brilliant way to use the time.

As for the bed, I found it both very comfortable and very warm. In many hotels of this kind of pricing, I have found the duvets can often be a little thin. But at City Inn Bristol they were thick enough so that I didn't wake up feeling cold even once during the night.

It was also a pleasure to find the shower both roomy (where you stand) and powerful.

The breakfast was included in my tariff and was a buffet style offering both hot and cold options (including cereal, scrambled egg, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausages, bacon etc). I had toast (choice of white or brown) along with tea, but they have several fruit juices as well. Although other hotels nearby have had a larger selection of items, I found it perfectly adequate and was full when I finished. I did forget to ask if the eggs were free range (the only thing I'm picky about food-wise).

I didn't have a car, so although there is parking available, I don't know what the costs are etc.

Pros:

*Under 5 mins walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station

*Having a computer with free internet access in the hotel room was fantastic both for information and a time killer (I was able to manage my ebay sales away from home)

*Very clean rooms and good bedding

*Freeview digital TV channels

*Double-glazed room - you can hardly hear a thing from outside when you shut the windows - always good when trying to sleep!

Cons:

*I honestly can't think of anything I didn't like. I suppose the outside of the building looks bland for a hotel - but this is hardly a negative!

I think I have found my new fave hotel in Bristol. Being a few mins walk from the main city station is great (which also means you're about 10 minutes walk from the town centre). But the stand out factor for me was not having to bring a laptop or mess around with my mobile phone to get at my emails. Instead I was able to use the iMac internet terminal while drinking coffee in my hotel room :)"
2714,jhanford,2009-04-30,4.0,"Fantastic hotel in City Centre - Cocktail Galore I stayed at this hotel over a weekend with a few friends and thought it was a fantastic spot!

The staff on check in gave a great service, very friendly and efficient. The rooms were also very clean and have amazing Imac systems with complimentary internet!! Although slightly on the small side they still had everything needed.

I did not use the restaurant as went out with friends although I did use the bar. The bar itself was small and not particularly lively, even the music was too low for any major atmosphere but the staff were outstanding. My girlfriend wanted cocktails so we asked for the list which was fairly extensive. The bar manager, Mike i believe, knew all the cocktails without looking and even taught us how to make them, and even did a little show just like the film. 

I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if you enjoy your cocktails.

The only downside is the car park, hardly any spaces with 24 hours for £8.50?! Should be maximum £3.50 in my eyes!!

Thankyou to all the staff, especially Mike in the bar and Jamie in reservations for the help."
2715,baldcoot73,2009-04-30,2.0,"Overpriced - Poor value for money Any hotel which charges its customers £8 for the privilege of parking in its car park has got alot to answer for.
Add to this the hidden charges for things like shoe polish( £4.50) a packet of mints (£1.50) and the poor breakfast which sets you back at £13 and hardly covers half of the plate it is served on then the answer as to whether i will stay here again is a resounding ""NO!"""

The staff were very friendly and the breakfast was fantastic - especially the creamy scrambled eggs.  Also loved the iMac in the room, the great shower and the White Company toiletries - which impressed the girlfriend.

We got an very cheap weekend b&b rate but you do pay to use the car park."
2717,Navigator627351,2009-03-31,4.0,"Nice hotel, but disappointing compared to the Westminster one We've stayed in the Westminster branch of City Inn loads of times and when we decided on a weekend in Bristol this seemed a natural choice.  Generally it's a good hotel however we've obviously been spoilt by the Westminster branch as the Bristol one is nowhere near as good!

Rooms - Smallish but clean and comfortable.  We only really used it as a base for exploring the city (and shops!) and it was great for this.  The shower in the bathroom was great and definitely made up for the lack of bath!  The iMac was brilliant - excellent for TV and music, plus internet access was useful

Location - Excellent location which meant everything was easily accessible.  There are lots of restaurants to try locally and the shopping was fantastic.

Food - We had room service breakfast one day.  Although the portions were generous as a whole it was disappointing - we were missing items we'd requested and for some reason we were only given cutlery and crockery for 1 when we'd ordered for 2!  Not worth the price we paid, particularly as there's an italian restaurant just past the church at the back of the hotel which does a much nicer breakfast for half the price! 

Service - We were disappointed with the service, particularly as the staff in the Westminster branch are so lovely.  Staff here were indifferent and hurried (maybe not enough of them as it was busy that weekend).  We asked for a lightbulb which had blown to be changed and were very unhelpfully told they might manage it that evening but that they didn't think there were any lightbulbs in the hotel....  However it had been changed when we got back

Car Parking - £8 per 24 hours.  We paid for the convenience of having the car nearby and somewhere secure(ish)  The car park is VERY small and it's a first come first served basis.  Expect to be parked in!"

Positives:

Comfortable beds
Plenty of car parking
Best entertainment system in hotel
Good value
Friendly helpful staff

Could have done better.

Room service, wrong and slow

That's all I can think of....

See you again."
2719,pac09,2009-02-28,5.0,"clean rooms in good location The hotel is in the perfect location for a trip to Bristol.  Two minutes walk from the train station and city centre, 5 minutes to the pubs at the waterfront.

Check in staff are friendly and helpful, rooms are well maintained.  Bar restaurant, and parking all available.

My only criticism would be the TV, great use of an apple computer with free Internet, but clear instruction on how to use it simply to watch TV would be helpful."
2720,IANTOJONES,2009-02-28,3.0,"Hotel was ok, but not great. On first impressions the hotel was very nice but I am not sure I would return.

I had to wait to check in as the receptionist kept answering the phone and ignoring me.  He seemed a little flustered and not particularly professional.

The room looked nice and was very clean but there was too much furniture in it for  the size, making it feel very cramped.  Saying that though, the furnishings were nice and modern.

I liked the imac entertainment system but it did not seem to remember volume settings and varied considerably with each channel.

The free WIFI was a plus but I guess the cost of this is covered in the high room rate.

The biggest let down was the bathroom.  Absolutely tiny and and an ugly, dirty looking green sink.  The power shower was difficult to use and lacked any power.  The temperature was either too hot or too cold, so it was not at all pleasant.

Parking was £7.50 per night and I feel that this should be included in the room rate.

Overall it was ok but not great."
2721,Fudge03,2009-02-28,2.0,"A weak link in the chain Compared to the City Inns in Westminster and Birmingham, this is a real weak link in the chain.  Overstretched receptionists with no conciege back up, rooms over-filled with furniture which was either unnecessary or too large, buffet breakfast very poor including cheese left out too long with hard edges, unattractive location on the wrong side of Temple Meades station.  I really didn't enjoy this very much!"
2722,AvocadoAnnie,2009-02-28,2.0,"Could be so much better Decor is good if you like simple, modern design.  The Apple computer which doubles as a TV / radio / CD player is a nice touch.  Lots of quibbles though which begin to add up - the first room I was given had been smoked in so I had to move, in the next room, two table lamps were on the blink.  The mattress was very soft and squishy - too much so for my back.  The ""free wifi throughout the hotel"" did not work in my room.  I spent over 20 minutes on the phone to the support number given, who were unable to resolve the problem and suggested the problem was probably with the access point nearest to my room.  On reporting this to reception they were willing to resolve this for me by moving me (again) or by providing me with a cable for the cable broadband (cable not supplied as a matter of course, which would have been preferable) but they showed zero interest in addressing this as a systemic problem - so avoid the 2nd floor if wifi matters to you.  Finally on checking my bill a day later I found I had been billed for my call to the telephone support number - they don't even make that a freephone number.  On calling back and pointing out that I shouldn't have to pay for trying to get the ""free wifi"" to work, this was refunded, but that final irritation has driven me to write this review.  This was my second stay at the City Inn and the second time out of two that I have had problems with the wifi.  If Bristol had a Malmaison I would stay there instead."
2723,Tisi83,2008-12-31,4.0,"Perfectly lovely We booked a special package with champagne and canapes and had a lovely 2 nt stay. The hotel was conveniently located very close to the train station and 5 mins walk from the main shopping area of the city. Breakfast was great although selection was a little limited.

Would recommend."
2724,europeangirl,2009-01-31,5.0,"Fantastic hotel in a great location I have just returned from a wonderful weekend in the City Inn Bristol hotel. I booked a last minute deal for €130 for two nights for 2 people. I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. The rooms were fabulous. Large with plenty of storage space, a big bathroom with a powerful shower. The whole place was immaculate; the bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows and extra blankets if needed. There were little extras like wine glasses, a proper ironing board and little biscuits which were much appreciated. However, the piece-de-resistance has got to be the entertainment system! The TV/computer/DVD player combo was ingenious. All the channels available as well which was great!

Location was brilliant, only a short 5 min walk from all the action. Also the temple-meads station is a 3 minute walk away – the bus from the airport stops here and is much cheaper than a taxi (only £8 rtn) Hotel staff were lovely and very helpful with any of our questions. I couldn’t fault the hotel, and will definitely be back to stay here in the future."

2726,Alison_L,2008-10-31,5.0,"Great service, good hotel I stayed for three nights at the City Inn as I was attending a training course in Bristol and the company had negotiated a special rate of £103 per night B&B.  The room was big with nice furnishings.  The bathroom was very spacious with a massive shower.  I liked having a Mac in my room with access to the internet, being away from home on my own, having access to Facebook and Ebay helped me to while away the time!
The rooms and bathroom were spotlessly clean and cannot be faulted.  
The restaurant had a great menu and I was able to have a great deal of choice during my stay.  With a large glass of wine my evening meal cost me between £25 and £30 for three courses.  The wine menu was quite good too.  Breakfast was of a very high standard although the full English could have been a little fuller but there was so much else to fill up on.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The hotel location is good within close proximity to the Temple Meads development and all the lovely new shops, including Harvey Nichols.  The shops are open until 8pm so after a days worth of business you can do some browsing too in order to relax.
Parking cost £7 a day which was a little steep but I suppose it is a city centre and it's aimed more at the business traveller.
A lovely stay and if I was to come to Bristol for pleasure I would consider staying here."
2727,Domearooney,2008-12-31,5.0,"Just a great, reasonable, well appointed hotel my firm has an account running with city inn and with this in mind I have to say I wasn't expecting that much based on the previous experiences I have had of medium range budget hotels. 

BUT from the first impression to the last it was a fantastic stay - and actually made being away from home for a night very enjoyable.

The room was great - especially the I-mac and great power shower and the food from room service was exceptional (try the fish and chips)

top notch - I'll be back."

Breakfast - had the haddock and poached egg and it was as  good as any beware eating between 7.30 8.30 very busy with business types in a rush. Bar meal in the evening was fine choose the 2 can share options (olives bread feta - goujons of sole - chicken strips and fries) approx £18 Normal hotel price drinks however an excellent Wine Merchants and local store (Cava Frexinet 6.50 bottle) can be found at the back of the hotel go through the church gounds which will take you to the junction where the Kings Head pub and Italian are located as mentioned in earlier reviews.

2730,jobietwo,2008-07-31,4.0,"Good Value Great value, really clean room, small but functional bathroom with good shower.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the furniture well chosen.

The menu in the hotel restaurant looked pretty good for dinner.  The breakfast was OK but there was an enormous queue so it took a while to be seated.  In fact I think this place suffers due to it's popularity as there was also a big queue for check-out.

Saying that the staff were great, the facilities in the room - especially the computer / tv - unexpected and welcome.

I'd definitely stay in a City Inn rather than consider it's competitors in this price range."

Would recommend for a city break in Bristol."
2732,magslhalliday,2008-10-31,2.0,"bad billing practise All our previous goodwill has been wiped out by them taking not only the bill but also an additional £100 from my debit account card on arrival for a weekend break without making it clear that an 'impression' was in fact a debiting. As I didn't realise this is what they had done, my whole weekend was spent worrying someone had cloned or hacked my card. 

The actual stay was fine, as it always has been before, but this mispractice means I would recommend you use them with caution."
2733,chillipepper16,2008-10-31,4.0,"Loved the iMac We arrived on Saturday 25th October to a queue of people at check-in. Took a little while, but not too long as they did have 2 people on check-in. Went up to our room, lovely and bright. One little moan is that our 'double room' was 2 single beds pushed together, so there was a ridge in the middle. The iMac was great, TV, DVDs, free internet access - very impressed. Bathroom was small but did the job nicely. We had dinner there too, which was very good. 3 courses is the right amount as they aren't huge portions. Well presented and tasty food. Breakfast was very good. Choice of cereal, fruit, yogurts, croissiants, pain au chocolate on the buffet, then cooked options are english breakfast, or I went for the kippers - delicious! Overall, a very enjoyable stay. I would stay there again, and recommend it to my friends."

Small but nicely furnished room.  Very comfortable bed.  Free computer in room which includes internet access, TV, DVD and CD player.  Large walk in shower cubicle instead of bath.

Breakfast was good with plenty of continental breakfast choice and freshly prepared cooked items. 

Location is about 10 minutes walk from centre of the city.

Parking in hotel car park or in a nearby pay and display which is free overnight.  As a solo female traveller I was a little worried about parking there beforehand in case it was a dark and creepy multistory but it was open air, well lit and just a few steps from the hotel entrance so felt safe and secure even arriving late at night.

Will definately stay there again."
2735,Cazywaz,2008-07-31,5.0,"Luxury at bargain prices We have stayed at the City Inn a few times before. Altho the rooms are not huge, they have everything (and more) that you need; a comfy bed, flat screen TV and a FREE to use PC. 

The bathrooms are clean, small with no bath but with a great shower.

We were meeting family in Bristol and they only had a budget for a B&B. However we booked 3 rooms for 2 nights for £300 total, far cheaper than most B&Bs that they were looking at. 

The parking used to be free but now they charge, but the hotel is still excellent value overall. Also one of our party is disabled so the staff made sure that a disabled space was always available for them, and also made sure that they were well looked after.

We will continue to stay at the City Inn as it gives us the comfort we require for a bargain price in a convenient location."
2736,LacyTracey,2008-10-31,5.0,"The Ideal Place To Stay We stayed and the City Inn Bristol for 3 nights in October, to celebrate my husbands 50th. 
 
Firstly, the hotel is in a perfect position. 5 minute walk from the train station, 10 minute walk to the new shopping Mall. There are lots of pubs and restaurants close by. 
   
The hotel is very modern and the rooms are clean and spacious. Our room had a large double bed with excellent quality bedding. Tea and coffee facilities in the room with a well stocked mini bar. An Apple computer system giving free unlimited internet access and quality sound system in each room. Satellite TV and a free DVD library also available at no extra cost.
     
There is an excellent restaurant on site with a top class menu and wine list. If you fancy something a little less formal you can choose food from the bar menu, which again, was very good quality. All the staff seemed very friendly and nothing was to much trouble, which gave us the impression of it being a 'happy ship'.
   
If we visit Bristol again we would return to the City Inn and we would also be tempted to try one of their other venues up and down the country. Overall, great value for money."
2737,marjesty,2008-10-31,5.0,"Modern/contemporary hotel-great staying! Great room, very neat and modern, very pleased, recommended!!! Best facilities for very low prices.

2738,Jet803405,2008-09-30,4.0,"Super modern hotel- lots around nearby The City Inn is situated ashort walk from both Temple Mead Station and the City Centre, it offers good quality, modern, clean accommodation- pretty much as you'd expect from the chain. 

I'd certainly use it again but my advice would be to forget the hotel restaurant (breakfast is excellent by the way), walk out of the rear doors, across the small park and at the 't' junction look left at the Dolce Vita- a lovely owner run italian cafe/restaurant. The food here is lovely- freshly prepared, good quality and very reasonably priced (under £15 for two courses including a drink)

To the right of this T junction is the Kings Head pub- one of the oldest in Bristol. Landlord run and straight out of a film set (literally- it's been used in several films) it's all oak booths, brass and etched glass- but the real deal not a modern imitation. Oh- and the beers lovely. IF YOU ARE FROM OVERSEAS THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY CHNCE YOU'LL GET TO SEE A 'REAL' British pub.

The hotel I'd recommend to anyone really- but take that short walk and you'll not regret it"
2739,Baxie,2008-08-31,3.0,"Nice Hotel but Warm! I have stayed in a few City inns alone on business but this time it was a weekend with my wife that took me to the City Inn Bristol.

For once it was a warm english summer weekend but unfortuntely this would somewhat spoil our stay as the air con in our room was not working, spoiling our sleep somewhat.  There was quite a lot of road noise which meant having the window open was a prrblem also.  We mentioned the aircon problem at reception a couple of times but no solution was offered.

The room as with all city inns was nice and the bathroom a little small but with a great shower and nice smellies.  I do wish City Inns would omit the small table in the rooms though as the rooms are just not big enough and makes them look cluttered.

As others have said the hotel is convenient for Temple Meads station a 5 to 10 min walk away.

The car park is at extra cost but busy and gets full - theres alternative pay and display (free at night) nearby though.  The hotel seemed relaxed about charging for the parking.

Overall not upto the usual standards of City Inn but a one off i hope."
2740,romah,2008-08-31,5.0,"First time stay ..but not the last I had the pleasure of staying at the City Inn in Bristol last weekend. I used Bristol as a base to get to Madonna at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and indeed it worked out very well. 
Cardiff is a hour way by coach . which stops about 5 minute walk from Stadium.
Cardiff hotels were all booked up and Bristol was the nearest alternative city . Flew into Bristol airport with Ryanair and the City Inn  hotel is conveniently with a  bus stop outside which is on the ""Flyer Coach"" route between Airport and City centre about 20-25 minutes from airport. (Note - Very handy ...) 
Local bus service  also bring you into city centre (or its about a 10 minute walk). 

Receptionists were very friendly and efficient and also very knowledgeable about the local area etc. I always have a lot of questions to ask to find my way around .. 

Hotel is located in the business district and is a quiet area especially on the bank holiday weekend. A little passing traffic outside but not very noisy 

Rooms were comfortable and clean ..really impressed with the Apple iMac in the room ..Television , Radio , Internet Access etc..
Warning : volume is very loud when turned on initially ...really loud.

Full English Breakfast at £12 was good and we had that both days . We did not eat in the restaurant but did have a lovely snack in the bar.

Again ..very good value and ideally located if you dont have a car..

Would highly recommend .."
2741,jaimie_es,2008-08-31,5.0,"me, myself and iMac Large modern property, a mere 10 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station. We got a room at the front of the building, not too large, contemporary in design, clearly aimed at business travellers. The hotel is on a busy thoroughfare but a double set of double glazed windows blocks off the noise of traffic. We did not experience noise from other rooms. 

In room facilities included air con, electronic safe, mini bar, trouser press, tea & coffee making facilities, and a state-of-the-art iMac multimedia entertainment system with digital TV, CD and DVD player, and free broadband Internet. Great fun! The bathroom was small, very small, with shower only, hairdryer, and some basic complimentary toiletries. 

Our discounted rate (booked online through Alpha Rooms) included full breakfast, and while we felt the quality of the products cooked to order (eggs, bacon and sausages) was rather average, we really enjoyed the continental buffet: cereal, yoghurts, fruit and fruit juice, cheese and meat cuts, smoked salmon, and a selection of pastries.. Definitely something to look forward to in the morning."

We paid £58 for one night through late rooms which is £2 cheaper than premier inn and I thought it was slightly better quality. There were a few more 'luxuries' you don't expect like the white company toiletries and bath robes. The bed was comfortable, the staff were friendly and the room/shower room were of a good size and clean. Plus there was easy parking which is free overnight from 6pm to 8am and £1 per hour thereafter (which you can pay the night before so no getting up early).
It really was good value for money and I'd stay here for a cheap, short break again."
2743,Leeleboy,2008-07-31,5.0,"Birthday Treat My partner booked a two night stay at the City Inn, Bristol as part of a present for my 30th birthday. We found parking easy at the hotel on Friday evening and the check-in was very quick. 

Someone must have informed the hotel that it was my birthday as on arrival there was a decent bottle of wine and a card from the manager wishing me a happy birthday and a pleasant stay.

The rooms were kitted out well and even had an apple computer which you can watch satellite and use for internet access at no extra charge. The bed was so comfy and had a better mattress than my own at home. We ate lunch in the hotel restaurant the following day and enjoyed both the food and the size of the portions.

On the night of my birthday I stayed up late and still got served at around 1o'clock in the morning and found the barman to be very friendly although drinks were quite expensive but I guess you expect this in a hotel bar.
I really enjoyed visiting Bristol as there was plenty to do. We walked into the centre which is about 5mins and never used the car until we checked out. We didn't see all that Bristol offers so I'm certain I will be returning to Bristol and the City Inn again in future."
2744,SKT_Devon,2008-06-30,4.0,"Good facilities, 10 mins to train station Booked through laterooms, but not cheap by any means.

A friend and I stayed here as a base to go and see a concert at Ashton Gate Stadium (only a £5 taxi ride away).

The reception staff were friendly and helpful.  Our room was pretty much as expected; clean and modern and included a mini bar and snacks, bath robes, ironing board and iron, corkscrew!, good multi media facilities and a nice walk in power shower.

The only negatives for me were that the tv was set to come on at a thousand decibels and when you finally turned it down the lowest volume level still made you wince!  And the car parking charges at £7.50 per day - I think thats a bit steep for a hotel car park! 

Nevertheless it's a great little modern hotel with good amenities, and fairly close to the train station.  I'd probably stay again at the right price."
2745,Fly_cruise_stay,2008-05-31,3.0,"Not as good as it was, but fine at the right price Stayed here back in 2005 and were really impressed with the city inn chain, but this time was not as good as the first. 
Arrived 17:00 on a sunday eve, the hotel was very quiet, and we got parked in the hotel car park, if it is busy you have to park down the road which is not ideal.
Checkin was quick and easy, but he girl on the front desk hardly said a word, didnt even get a smile, so not a great welcome by any means.
Our room was on the 1st floor, was small but had everything you could want, mini bar, lcd T.V, comfy dble bed and arm chair. The bathroom was tiny, and had hardly any toiletries, the ""fluffy"" bathrobes were far from ""fluffy"" and looked like they had been worn a million times! Our window would not shut properly and the room was not spotless as you would expect. I dont think any money had been spent on the hotel since it first opend and in my opinion it was looking a little tired compared to our previous stay.
We booked through hotel website a month in advance, we paid £49 which was a good price and i have to recomend it at that price.
Theres alot of hotels in Bristol and many near to this one, I would not put anybody off if you can get it at the right price, but anything more that £60 id look elsewhere"
2746,McAnnie1,2008-05-31,4.0,"A haven for travellers This was so unexepected.  A very convenient location & clean, modern room which was ideal for 1 traveller.  Bit small for 2 tho.  What really wowed me was the quality of the food.  Being a female traveller on my own I ordered room service & the starter & main course were mouthwatering which is so unusual for a city centre chain hotel, well done City Inns.

Another amazing thing - the express pick up breakfast for £3.50 - a coffee and a bacon or sausage roll or muffin or fruit salad.  That's what every hotel should be doing.  We don't all want to sit down & pay mega money for a plate of heart attack food.  Can't congratulate them enough on this innovative idea at such a great price.

I'll be recommending this place to all my fellow travellers & all for the price of £92 per night."
2747,Crispy697,2008-05-31,5.0,"Plain and Simple.....Perfect for business stays I stay at the City Inn for 1 or 2 nights almost every week.  Whilst the hotel doesn't offer the last word in luxury, it does offer the business traveller a plain and simple bolt-hole when spending time in Bristol (or the surrounding area).  The rooms are clean and tidy, with a minimalist feel, therefore helping you unwind at the end of another stressful day.

Being a light sleeper, I'm particularly impressed with the sound proofing between rooms......this is one of the only hotels I've stayed in where I've not been disturbed by other guests.  Moreover, having an aircon system that actually works (which is rare in Bristol) also helps to provide a comfortable night's sleep in summer months.

The food is good (although a little more choice would be welcome), whether being served in the restaurant or as room-service.

As highlighted in previous reviews, the old TV's were a little on the small size.  However, these have now been replaced by iMac's which are great.  Not only do they provide a great quality TV picture, they provide full PC capabilities including the internet.

All in all a great hotel."
2748,Chaid1,2008-02-29,4.0,"A pleasent stay On arrival i was impressed with the look of the reception area and bar. It was clean and contempary. The reception staff were helpful and friendly.

The room i stayed in was well layed out and equiped for the modern working lifestyle. Having a wi fi connection proved useful. The t.v was a little on the small side, but served its purpose.  

Unfortunately there was no bath, just a shower. But as i was only staying for one night it did not matter too much. The shower room was clean and inkeeping with the rest of the hotel.

Overall it was a pleasent stay and i would be more than happy to use the City Inn again."
2749,davidhchess,2008-04-30,4.0,"OK for Budget Business Well at £45 for the room and free wifi access this has to be good value for the budget conscious business traveler.

The room was clean and the bathroom though small and shower only was fine. The TV set (see other reviews) was indeed small but usable and the addition of some additional Sky channels was welcome.

My tip would be not to eat or drink at the hotel if you can avoid it. Prices are on the steep side, and you can do better in Bristol centre which is only a walk away.

When I was there a couple of hen and stag parties decided that 4 a.m. was a good time to party outside my room door, but the hotel is not to blame for that. Be warned though, that this is the business they seem to be in.

Other than that, fine and cheaper overall than the Premier Inn/Traellodge alternatives."
2750,CatweazleUK,2008-04-30,2.0,"All fur coat and no knickers... This is a budget hotel, with quality hotel prices.

Things to look out for:
  * Scuff marks on the walls throughout giving it a tired feel. This was more noticeable above the level of the reception.
  * Stained and tired carpets in the walkways and bedrooms
  * The worlds smallest bathroom...sorry shower room (there is no bath). Swinging a kitten would be out of the question.
  * Prices for food. They are obviously very proud of their restaurant and what they consider to be the quality of their food but it is not worth London style prices. The menu is overly pretentious, complete with 'jus' and 'poche'. I had fish and chips with mushy peas...don't ask me to repeat what it was called on the menu. The Fish was about the size of a packet of cigarettes, and had soggy batter, the Chips were served stacked at right angles (I counted 8 chips) and were brown but soggy and not cooked in the middle, the Peas were nice. Also, the same set menu was served for Lunch and Dinner...exactly the same food, on the same plates...but when served in the evening it was about £7 more expensive for 2 courses.
  * Room charges. I was charged £109 a night for 2 nights being Monday and Tuesday. The reception staff made a mess of charging my card, (which didn't need a PIN number or signature, they just swiped it), and when I came to check out and pay for my parking £15 for two nights, I was told that the room prices had changed from when I paid, it was now £20 more expensive. I refused to pay it, and they graciously took it off. It wouldn't suprise me to see it on my statement in the near future.
  * The smallest TV in the world. The TV in the room was smaller than the monitor on my computer at work. It was only just bigger than my laptop screen. Watching the football from on the bed was only made bearable by the fact that the room was so small that the bed and the TV were almost touching. The channels on the TV were suitable for lonely businessmen. The location of the CBBC channel and the unrestricted Playboy channel (with no warning or parental control) made me wonder how many awkward conversations have been had in this hotel with children about 'wrestling'.
  * Old mattresses and bedding stored in alcoves by the lifts. I hadn't seen this sort of thing in a hotel in years, let alone one that charges over £100 a night in Bristol.
  * The Double bed that I booked was two singles pushed together, and the cheap mattresses had thick seams around the edge that meant that lieing in the middle of the bed was very uncomfortable.

On the plus side the bar seemed popular with locals, the service in the bar and restaurant were pretty good, the food was OK. It just didn't live up to it's own pretentions or the price."

2752,ChunkyAl,2008-03-31,5.0,"Pleasantly surprised - excellent stay The City Inn is a modern square building in the business district of Bristol.  I stayed 2 nights and had a superb stay.  The reception is modern and airy - the staff that checked me in were pelasant and polite.  The room was small and situated at the rear overlooking a small park - my colleague stayed at the front and said the road noise was a little noisy from 6.30am but was ok with the window closed.  The room was extremely clean and well designed with excellent modern neutral furniture, a very comfortable mattress, the dvd/cd player was excellent - I brought some with me to watch - so no charge for ""box office"" like other hotels.  It had a mini bar - which was expensive - but that was no surprise.  The showerroom was excellent, clean, modern and had ""the white company"" toiletries.  Excellent quality.  I had breakfast both mornings and dinner in the restaurant on the first night.  The service was as per a 5 star hotel - superb - the food was stunning - slightly pricey from the a la carte - but well worth it as the company was paying.  The downside is there is nothing nearby - ie restaurants, shops, newsagent etc - so you would have to drive - the dock area being the best place for choice.  The hotel carpark is small so dont be surprised if you cant get a space but there is another public carpark at the rear.  There is a lot of building work all around Bristol but none really encroached on the hotel during my stay.  If I stay in Bristol again I will certainly stay in this hotel.  As a final note - the fitness room - it made me laugh it is one of the bedrooms made into a fitness suite - one runnign maching, one bike machine, a weights station and a tv - so its quite cosy!!!!!  You get to know your fellow fitness geeks very quickly - make sure you put on extra deoderant!"
2753,RebekahB,2008-03-31,4.0,"Great value as always Having had a great stay at the City Inn in Manchester, it seemed a no-brainer to book a room at it's sister hotel in Bristol.

The hotel is fairly central (Bristol isn't that big) and the rooms are functional. It's not as impressive as the Manchester version either in terms of location or rooms (smaller, no internet/ipod Dock) but it's still outstanding value at £59 a night."
2754,NicoleB79,2008-02-29,3.0,"Nice room but terrible service / location The rooms in City Inn are small but excellently designed.  Unfortunately, with the current building work going on around the hotel, there is no real benefit to staying here.  I would suggest the Jurys or Marriott as being better placed for the pleasant side of Bristol.  Staff were terrible - basically young kids who didn't speak good English or seem particularly interested in being helpful.  Car park was full and we were told to park at the multi-storey nearby, and move the car in the morning.  To be fair, the website states that there is limited parking so we expected this. Didn't expect that when a spot became free it would cost £7.  No breakfast included, so not good value for money.  In short, if you want a pleasant room to lay your head, the City Inn is fine.  But if you want a nice break and good service, try elsewhere."
2755,EbenVZ,2008-02-29,1.0,"Shambolic Our group booked for ten guys at £79 per night for Friday and Saturday. When we went to check out the Saturday room rate had gone up to £95. Even more frustratingly, although the room bills were collectively settled up on the Sunday morning, the credit cards used for guarantee on each room were separately charged with the full amount for the two nights, plus an extra and inexplicable £50 per night. 

We've been told that it is standard practice for them to take this money and then pay it back. We're still waiting to see if we do get our money back, but irrespective of that the inconvenience to some of our party of having nearly £300 disappear unnecessarily from their bank accounts for a week is bad for the cash flow and leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.

Good weekend though, other than that."

2757,uktraveller009,2008-02-29,3.0,"Not bad for one night if you just need somewhere to sleep or work Best thing about the hotel was the cleanliness - the decor is clean neutral tones and everything looks well attended to. The bathroom was tiny with no bath but the cubicle shower was a fair size. 

Lovely big window in the room and good sized desk. The addition of a cd player and dvd in the room are a good idea although I didn't use them. 

Not close to any shops/garages so you couldn't pop out for anything on foot but the mini bar does contain a bar of Green and Blacks (£2), gourmet crisps (£1.30) and there's a nice-looking (and averagely expensive) room service menu."
2758,dollydosh,2008-02-29,4.0,"tiny room We found this hotel spotlessly clean and very nicely decorated, but the room was very very small,the bathroom was also very tiny.not big enough to swing a cat.
We paid £82 for a wednesday night with hotelconnect.com, had we paid other advertised prices of in excess of £100 i think we would have felt robbed.

If we return to bristol i know where we'll be staying !!!"
2759,TimManchester,2008-02-29,1.0,"Farcical and not to be recommended I phoned the hotel on a Friday to get a room for the Saturday night and was offered a deal of £69 or £89 for a ""slightly larger room"", a fruit platter and luxury toiletries.  We live in Manchester where a very smart new City Inn has opened - we've have drinks in the very smart cocktail bar a couple of times and have seen the rooms and know they are fairly small.  On arriving the room didn't seem like it could possibly have been any smaller though so I phoned reception to check and was told that all rooms are the same size.  This confirms an earlier reviewer who complained abour staff not knowing the packages they were selling.  

The fruit platter was quite good though and ended up saving us money that we would have spent in the restaurant on dinner and so I forgot about the misselling of the room size.  The location is quite good and it is just a short walk to the city centre and a very short drive from the motorway network.

Small niggles like the tv not working properly and only one towel in the bathroom added to the list of complaints.

Breakfast was quite good but was buffet and some things were looking a little tired (I'm talking about the food not the guests).  The worst though was the farce of the room entry card not working and still not working having taken it back to reception 4 times - our room was on first floor close to the stairs so this was just annoying - totally unacceptable if we'd been further away.  To make matters worse the same dozy receptionist didnt give us a code number to exit the car park even though I'd just told her we had a car there.

There does seem to be a consistency to the recent reviews - the rooms are small and there will be something major wrong with the hotel.

On top of this the building is fairly ugly.  No, we won't be staying again, definately, never."
2760,Mitrvls,2007-09-30,3.0,"Over hyped Ridiculously small room, the bathroom is a closet not big enough to swing a mouse let alone a cat. Food ok, not exactly special the location is not very good either. Also we booked two rooms and only one was available (because we turned up late.)

They basically said the error was ours and showed us a screen print. Actually when we got back to the office our travel dept dug out the “real” reservation and it seems they messed up the booking.

8.30pm and my colleague had to hunt down a room in Bristol for the night. Not good."
2761,snowbird28,2007-12-31,5.0,"A Wonderful stay, and excellent value! My partner and I have stayed at this hotel twice in the past 12 months, and on both occasions we have enjoyed impeccably clean, if compact rooms - though not so compact when you consider what you would get in other city hotel accommodation for the price.

We booked this time for a one-night dinner, bed and breakfast offer which was extremely good value and included a bottle of wine, room with dvd/cd player, hairdryer, tea-making facilities, iron/ironing board, mini-bar and bathrobes for the bargain price of  £99.00 for the two of us. 

Check-in was great, and the girl on the desk was very friendly and extremely professional.

We enjoyed the 'White Company'  toiletries which were large, wall-mounted, and full.  This was in addition to the usual small bottles of shampoo/conditioner, etc.  

It appeared that the rooms had recently been refurbished, as the information sheet stated that the hairdryer was in the drawer under the tv set, when in fact it was in a bag in the wardrobe - (This I found out only when I phoned down to complain)!

The toilet roll holder was loose, yes, but really I would be nit-picking to complain about these minor details, when the rest of the room and the service was of such a high standard.

The food was very good, service impeccable, and the menu quite varied for dinner.  

The following morning we had not just 'continental, or cereals and ""full english""; but a better than average choice - in fact all you could wish for, including fresh fruit salad and smoked salmon and scrambled eggs on toasted brioch, kippers, etc.

We left very happy and relaxed, and yes, we will be back!"
2762,Diamondwatcher,2007-11-30,4.0,"Very smart hotel Got this place as a bargain through lastminute.com, as a top secret bargain, and were really pleased to get this place for less than £60 for the room. The hotel is a really smart building with a trendy looking bar and restaurant. Didn't eat there as we were dining in town, but we had a drink in the bar before going out and it was nice.

Reception was quick, efficient and friendly, and the room was nice, if a bit small. The bathroom was really small but everything you needed was there.
Bed was big and comfy. The only thing we found strange was the many light switches for the lamps etc. There were loads and seemed to turn some lights on and some off! Bit confusing after a night out.

This place was great value for less than the price of a Travelodge"
2763,LondonHappytraveller,2007-11-30,2.0,"Not the best in the chain Having previously stayed at the London Westminster and more recently the excellent new Manchester establishments, we were expecting more of the same in Bristol.  However, a few things disappointed us.  We noticed were that there was no hand soap in the bathroom.  The liquid soap dispenser had been removed from the wall.  We couldn't get access to the mini bar because it was locked.  We called reception who sent someone up to investigate and after a short delay, provided us with soap and a key to the fridge.  The room was small (but we didn't expect it to be large).  During the night, we heard other doors opening and closing as the refurb hadn't included 'noise free' door close features which is standard in many hotels these days.  The most disappointing aspect was the breakfast - full buffet style (unlike Manchester which provided cook to order on hot food).  The eggs, bacon etc on the buffet were cold and unappetising.  Tea was served in the teapot the size of an eggcup and toast came in very small portions for two people.  We wouldn't stay at this branch of the City Inn again - it really seemed like the 'poor relation' to its siblings in London and Manchester.  Don't understand why this hotel has in not of the same standard when they are all supposed to be 4 star."
2764,Turnhill,2007-05-31,2.0,"Not impressed I have stayed at the City Inn several times on business.  I used to be satisfied with the hotel but on recent visits there is always something wrong.  
The modern compact rooms are OK for one traveler but crowded for two, the bathroom is very small with only a shower.  Soap is in dispensers; on one visit neither of the two dispensers would pump any soap.  For two days I dismantled them to get the soap out but the staff didn't have the savvy to realise that they didn't work and just kept putting them back together. 
The rooms were refurbished recently although that didn't improve things much.  Simple problems become annoying when there is always something wrong - I don't expect to keep asking for obvious things to be made available such as, no coat hangers, no TV remote, DVD wasn't connected to the TV, safe locked by previous guest and inaccessible, no complimentary beverage.
The restaurant serves expensive micro cuisine - don't eat here if you’re hungry.
I received a very pert letter following one visit demanding 65 pence for a minibar item that I didn’t take – would you risk upsetting a client for this amount of money?
The hotel seems to lack management setting any exacting standards.  
I now stay at the Marriott when I am in Bristol – a far better option for the same price."
2765,UK1000,2007-10-31,5.0,"Very enjoyable stay My husband and I stayed here for a 2 night break at the beginning of October (Fri and Sat nights).  We had booked this hotel as most other hotels in Bristol were fully booked on the Saturday night.

We got a fairly good deal which also included breakfast.  The bedrooms are contemporary style, with TV dvd player and stereo, and tea/coffee making facilities and minibar.  The bedroom was fairly compact as was the bathroom (shower only - no bath) but it was sufficient for our stay.  The bed was comfortable and the room quiet.  We stayed in room 112 overlooking the churchyard at the back.

The location was good - a brisk 10 minute walk into Broadmead shopping centre, and also a short walk to the centre/Park Street area.  Being in the business end of town it was probably quieter than being right in Bristol city centre.  There is a bus stop in front of the hotel which goes regularly to Clifton/Whiteladies Road (bus numbers 8 and 9) so we took this option rather than a more expensive taxi.

Parking at the hotel was fine - we paid £7.50 per day to leave the car there and then just explored Bristol on foot.

Breakfast was good - a buffet style continental and cooked breakfast.  The hotel was busy but they had quite a few staff on and kept things moving.

Overall, I was pleased with this hotel and could quite easily have stayed a few more days!"

2768,helsebels,2007-09-30,2.0,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Stayed at the City Inn w/c 3rd Sept and enjoyed the stay with only one problem of the internet cable not working one night which was quickly resolved by David in Guest Services who was lovely.

W/c 10th Sept back in the hotel with work for another 4 nts. Check in was fine again. Room 135 - went and unpacked only to find out the internet not working - David helped again but advised me to change rooms - so changed to 140 across the hall.
After unpacking again surveyed the room to find wine stain on carpet, toilet roll holder and soap holder coming away from the walls, no desk lamp and no CD player - not too bothered about CD player as don't use them. 
Made reception aware of the problems - nothing can be done about the desk lamp or the carpet - soap and toilet holder both fixed

By Thurs starting to get sick of the posh menu and craving some normal food. On the menu it says if there is something you want but it is not on the menu just ask -so I did and wish I didn't.
Ordered room service and got the Chef Peter who was rude and aggressive. He said they did not do that and if they had prior warning then maybe get something else in but would need 10 days notice! All I asked was could I get a burger or something like that - I had the lamb burger last wk and was not keen on all the spices and chillies in it I just wanted something plain!
I told him fine don't worry and ordered the omlette which I have just had and was lovely all though having worked in hotel restaurants years ago when at Uni, was probably spat in or something - maybe not - who knows!
The one excellent thing on the menu is the cheese and biscuits which are homemade oat cakes and taste gorgeous!

As for Peter well next time I am in Bristol for the wk with work I will
look into other hotels - hey they may not be so upper class but at least they may be friendly

Stay in rm 140 at your peril!"
2769,grant_aileen,2007-08-31,5.0,"great hotel This is the frist time I have stayed in a City Inn hotel. Great place, very clean and the staff were really friendly. Room was above my expectations and I will definately stay there again."
2770,roxy8203,2007-06-30,2.0,"Don't get the breakfast Myself and 3 friends recently stayed at the City Inn for a hen weekend. The rooms are very nice as other comments have said, very modern with good facilities, but would agree the bathroom was too small. We booked two twin rooms on the same floor for our stay and when we arrived  the only twin rooms they had were on different floors so we ended up with two doubles, luckly we've known each other for years!! 

The hotel is modern and clean and the front of house staff are very pleasent so no complaints there.

We went into the bar for a drink before we went out but it was very dark and not very inviting, also drinks were expensive but we were only staying for one so no big deal.

The main complaint is the breakfast which we paid for as part of our stay. We got down to breakfast very early ont eh first morning and there was hardly anyone there. We ordered two cooked breakfasts and two toast and cerial. The toast and cerial was fine but after waiting over half an hour for the two cooked breakfast, which we were told 3 time were on there way we walked out with out it as we had plans for the day.

The next morning it was a bit later so it was a lot busier, this time we did get our cooked breakfasts but some of the order was wrong, one person ordered fried egg but it came out scrammbled, but not your usual scrammbled egg, it was a funny orange colour and looked really soggy and wet, not white and fluffy like it should be. She sent it back and it never re-appeared so she went without the breakfast she'd paid for two days in a row.
I think they are trying to hard to be a posh resturant when they don't have the man power to support that.

One last thing is the parking, £7.50 for 24hours is a bit steep when your already paying to stay there, but there are cheaper car parks just minutes from the hotel, there is one just aroud the back.

All in all the hotel is very nice and the beds are lovely and big, the rooms are well looked after and very clean, the only thing that lets it down is the food."
2771,BristolHound,2007-06-30,4.0,"Perfectly OK Booked six rooms for a stag do in Bristol, although I live in Bristol, several friends were travelling over, so I stayed over as well. Rooms were some of the cheapest we could find in Bristol, and they were fantastic. Great showers, clean rooms, a good english breakfast included. Ticked all the right boxes and would throughly recommend it."
2772,Plutonium,2007-06-30,1.0,"Falls short of its boastful web pages. As a business traveller I spend most of the week in various hotels around the country. Some large chains and many independents. We chose this hotel for a weekend family break based upon competitive pricing and it's apparently good reviews, a sort of busman’s holiday if you like.

The rooms are a modern contemporary design, clean and well serviced. The room sizes and in particular the shower room are very small compared to those of most hotel chains, the layout being a little unconventional. The wardrobe is in a far corner which makes access difficult and there is nowhere to land and unpack a case, except either the cluttered floor of the crisp white duvet. If you have two cases you will be falling over them constantly. The promised champagne upon arrival did not materialise. This is included in the 'Lazy Sundays' package.

The bar is functional but its design is not welcoming. Whilst attempting to be cutting edge contemporary, and yes it is very smart, all ambience is lost. There were twenty or so people in the bar and we still had a long wait for a barman to appear. After the small party at the bar decided to move on, the floor of the whole bar area was mopped down around us whilst we sat and watched at 5pm, even though they clearly left no mess. We spent our beer tokens elsewhere.

Breakfast was disappointing. Most disappointing was the cost. With the Lazy Sundays package, there is no breakfast, only a buffet lunch, and incredibly breakfast is charged extra. Presumably we late risers don't expect to eat.

After speaking with the Manager it would appear that something different is on offer to the weekday business clients which is odd. During the weekends the food is buffet style. There was no toast on offer; it is cooked on request and badly at that. Slightly warmed and soggy bread is not toast, I prefer to toast my own, and several guests complained. The entire full English menu was dried up and the serving implements confused and messy. Scrambled eggs cooked with cream were peculiar and very spicy sausages are not to many people’s taste either, it would seem. The restaurant manager was receptive to comments but didn't actually offer to put right any of the issues raised which was a missed opportunity. Instead I was referred to front of house again.

Now, the most annoying part of having to complain is when none of the staff even know the contents of their own package deals.
Three people, two managers and front of house do not know the pricing structure at all. A follow up phone call during the week to the duty manager confirmed this; again, they clearly have no idea what they are selling.

We took a 'Lazy Sundays' upgrade (£110) at a cost of £45 over a standard room only rate of £65. B&B was being charged at £69.

Now, here is the anomaly. 
With this package there is no included breakfast only a buffet Sunday lunch which retails at £18.50 per head (£37 /couple)
So, in effect you are paying £8 more for this 'deal' than if you booked a room only and lunch separately. 
Bizarre? Yes, even the staff thought so.

Apparently you can have breakfast instead of the lunch but as this is clearly valued at £4 per head why on earth would you do this? No breakfast is going to cost you £18.50 per head, so it's simply ludicrous to suggest this as an option.

Personally, having a checkout time of 2.5hrs later, a tiny box of cheap chocolates and a glass of champagne (even if it had arrived) would not encourage me to pay the extra £8.

I can’t wait for next week where myself, and my daily business, return the known quality and no nonsense approach of the Intercontinental Hotel group (Holiday Inn). Not always perfect, but at least they do try."
2773,tarebearky,2007-06-30,4.0,"Very nice, but there are better for the same price... I recently spent two nights in Bristol - my first night was at the City Inn.  Overall, it was a very nice hotel.  The staff at reception was quite friendly and helpful.  My room was a good size, very clean.  The bed was very comfortable!  The only downfall of the room was the size of the bathroom - it was very small.  However, it was still nice enough, just a bit difficult to move around in the bathroom.  The hotel offers FREE wireless internet!  I wish all hotels did this!  They also have a nice service - a library of cds and dvds to use in the stereos and dvd players in the guest rooms.  I didn't use this service, so I can't describe it from personal experience, but sounds like a nice idea from what they told me at reception.  The location was good - a short walk from Temple Meads train station (about 5 or 7 minutes).  However, one problem is that there really isn't much directly around the hotel in terms of restaurants, banks, etc.  You really have to walk into town for most of that, which is about a 15 minute walk, I believe.  Not too bad, but a bit of an inconvenience.  The food at the restaurant and through room service was a bit expensive, especially compared with the other 4 star hotel I stayed at for my second night in Bristol.  Overall, a very nice hotel, and I would say you couldn't really go wrong with it.  However, I did prefer the hotel I stayed at the second night... it was the same price for a  bigger room and bathroom, and breakfast included (it was not included at City Inn)."
2774,Gordon2112,2007-05-31,5.0,"Highly recommended Just back from a 1-night weekend stay at the City inn Bristol.  Although we don't know Bristol well, we were able to find the hotel very easily in the car and parking was no problem (be aware they've just introduced a £7.50 /24 hour charge, whereas it used to be free).

Our room on the top floor looked out over the main road but I have to say the soundproofing was great, no exterior noise at all in the room.  We loved the modern decor, very much our taste and the furnishings were all clean and stylish.  Nice, spotlessly clean bathroom with power shower.   Bed very comfortable maybe a bit soft for some people though.

As we were going to a concert at the Academy we decided to eat in the City Cafe bar at 6pm (main restaurant not open until 7pm).  We were the first customers to order food that evening and the chef had just arrived so it took some time for the food to come, but the waitress kept us informed and the food was fantastic when it came, way beyond what you might normally expect in a bar.  Reasonable prices too.

We asked for a late check-out in advance and this was no problem at all.  Breakfast sent up to the room was of a good standard apart from a few minor errors on the order.  

Overall a very relaxing experience and a thoroughly professional set-up.  We would stay here again any time."
2775,CRICKLEWOOD,2007-05-31,4.0,"Even better if your room is at the back Location – Near temple Meads & opposite the new Rivergate Development incorporating Bristol & West. RBS  etc. The hotel faces a very busy road but backs on to a churchyard – so select your bedroom with care. 

Parking – Tight car park to the front & side – get there as soon after 5pm as you can or may not get a space. 

The building – Very modern – air con to rooms. 

Reception & Public areas – Very smart & fresh 

The rooms – Ask for one at the back overlooking the church – if not available then on the front high up is best. Rooms just upgraded so most things are new – very comfy bed – flat screen telly, DVD player; most channels on the TV are free 

The bathroom – Single shower booth enough space for toilet bag – in all well designed 

Food – Very good value in the restaurant – the fixed price menu is interesting combining different tastes – mango ice cream with smoked salmon – sounds terrible but really worked as did the black pepper ice cream. The fixed menu is under £20 so you cannot complain  

Staff – Very professional, friendly – especially in the restaurant 

Over all – Really good hotel as is there branch in Birmingham – book early for a good price. 

Tip – If using express check out make sure you get the exit code for the car park on check in otherwise you will need to queue to get it in the morning."
2776,ChelleandDean,2007-03-31,4.0,"very nice lovely, clean and modern.  When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised by the ariy reception and modern dining area.  Unfortunately we asked for a non smoking room but the room we got had definitley had someone smoking in it before we arrived.  The hotel moved us without problem. We had a lovely room with a view over the city.  They are small rooms but as we were out every day it didnt matter.   The hotel is 5 minutes walk from the river which is great for access to all the bars and restaurants - this will be even better when the no smoking rule is brought in in the summer.
the hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great.  Full fry-up or continental buffet - or both (as my husband had).  Definitely a great place to stay if you are in Bristol for the weekend."

2778,Prop,2007-02-28,3.0,"Cool or cold? You decide I stayed here on business. The hotel has a contemporary minimalist theme. It was a bit too clinical and cold for my taste, but others might think it is the epitome of cool.

A lot of work was also going on at the hotel. Although this did not cause any disruption there was a prominent smell of fresh paint in the lobby and my room.

My room was well sized and well furnished. The only gripe was the bathroom which was tiny and had only a walk in shower. That said it was a power shower which worked well.

I had 4 meals at the hotel. Again in keeping with the brand image this was nouvelle cuisine. It was excellently presented and very tasty, but not exactly hearty fare. I ordered fish and chips one night and it came with square cut chips stacked in a tidy cube shape and the fish resting on a bed of guacamole! You get the idea!

Breakfast were good if again a bit minimalist.

The hotel's claim that they are a 2 minute walk from Temple Meads is a bit optimistic. I am reasonable fit and was carrying a small overnight bag and a laptop. The brisk walk took about 10 minutes. the directions and map could be better too.

The hotel is about a 10 minute walk form the City centre shops.

All in all, a good choice for a business stay. Otherwise it is a question of taste. If you like your hotels modern and minimalist, you will be ok here."
2779,plymouthtraveller1,2007-01-31,3.0,"Nice for a short stay The instructions on how to get to the City Inn from Temple Meads Station were not very accurate! However, on arrival, the staff were friendly and the room was clean and adequate, if a touch on the small side. The shower was easy to manage (often a problem), there were complimentary toiletries and the TV was easy to operate. Someone stole our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign from outside the door on Saturday (very bizarre) and the room key failed to operate on Saturday evening, resulting in having to go downstairs to get it sorted.  Also, they tried to charge for a newspaper that wasn't ordered. The breakfast was pricy (£12.50 for a full cooked breakfast) but it was well delicious if slightly on the small side. No butter on the tables (just marge), I felt they should give you a choice. For a short stay the location is excellent and the hotel is quiet and friendly but the rooms are small if you are staying for longer than a couple of nights."

It's 5 mins walk from Corn St/Queen Square and St Mary Redcliffe. The hotel is modern and the rooms aren't that big but they are well equipped (dvd player, wifi) and comfortable. Service was excellent. We paid £57 a night for the room, which included parking. The location on a dual carriageway looks unpromising but our room was the other side of the hotel and very quiet.. One fun option is to have a trip to Bath, 15 mins away by train. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but the menu looked attractive and the bar food we had (vegetable tempura and chilli chicken) was excellent. Overall we were impressed with the value for money."

Our room was slightly on the small side but as we only needed it for a place to sleep it wasn't a problem although I'd get a bit claustrophobic there if I'd stayed for a few days!  

The breakfast was very nice and was freshly cooked and the decor was all very modern.

Unfortunately, the fire alarm went off at 6.30am which meant that we all had to be evacuated - but, hey these things happen!  However we thought that their customer service was absolutely fab as we mentioned it on checking out and were given a voucher for a free stay :-)"
2782,BecciGlos,2006-07-31,3.0,"No room to swing a cat! I was really surprised to find so many flattering reviews!
There is absolutely nothing wrong with the hotel itself. But the size of the rooms, the location and the prices let it down. The public areas are modern and stylish, the service and bar very nice. But those rooms! It is uncomfortably small. The bathroom is laughably small. The plasma tv and the cd player are lovely touches and the mini-bar 'basket' is very kitsch. Why you would ever want to order room service here is beyond me, I'd get claustrophobic! For a one night stay where you are going out anyway it is fine, but not for a leisure or long stay. At the weekend the rates are much more affordable, esp from other websites, but in the week the rates are astronomical for what you actually get. Not particuarly central or pleasant location either."
2783,annuccia,2005-11-30,5.0,"City Chic with a Difference The City Inn in Bristol is unique amongst other city-based hotels.
Situated in the heart of Temple Quay (Bristol's equivalent to London's docklands). It is contemporary, modern and stylish, and offers the business traveller to the West Country an oasis of chic, contemporary comfort. This would be my number one choice whenever I fly into Bristol. As a French resident, the hotel, and the City Café, offers me everything that I would wish to find in France. The very buzzing City Café, in the capable hands of David Quinion, offers the most imaginative cuisine that one could expect to find in Bristol. Coming from Southern France, I well remember the saddle of rabbit with black pudding on an apple, potato and sage rosti. As I will be back there on 5 November , I hope that he still has it on the menu! If not, I am confident that there will be something to take its place  -   every dish on the menu is a temptation for the tastebuds!"
2784,pmfreeman,2006-10-31,5.0,"I wish there were more City Inns! The 4th time I've stayed at this hotel!  A great hotel!  Its always my 1st choice of hotel when I go to Bristol.  Its just that bit nicer than a ""budget"" hotel.

Price:  
I think this hotel is a bargain considering it's in Bristol city centre.  The £10-£20 more I've paid on average to stay here rather that at large budget hotel chains is definitely worth it.

Service:
Always had great service from the staff at the hotel

Room:
Very comfortable, with flatscreen TV, DVD player and movie selection, complementary chocolate biscuits and a good in-room selection of snacks to buy.

The bathroom was small but stylish and modern, great shower, but no bath.  Bath robes are supplied.

Restaurant:
I ate here for the first time this stay and was not disappointed.  I received a voucher on check in for free wine and the 3 course dinner was very very good and not over priced considering the standard.

Location:
Very near the Temple Meads Station and in centre/business district.  

Other:
This City Inn has parking.  There are a few more City Inns around the country.  Don't forget to go and see Bristol's very own ""Leaning Tower"" - Temple Church at the rear of the hotel!"
2785,fly4fun2,2006-10-31,5.0,"Great Business Hotel I loved this hotel for all it's creature comforts. I stayed 5 night in a row and then came back for a following 1 night stay after the weekend. I had the choice when I came for work to Bristol to stay in the Marriot which was closer to the office, however the extras this place offered stole my attention from the airmiles bonus I would have got at the Marriott. 

The City Inn is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from Temple Meads station. If you exit the station via the car park (follow the signs for the ferry) its much quicker than going all the way down to the main road and navigating the roundabouts. 

Check-in was quick and painless. I had a 5th floor garden facing room. The DVD and CD player are fantastic and the LCD TV is so much better than TVs boxed in cupboards that other places do. The best bit was the FREE broadband access. I just plugged my laptop in and away I went. Much better than typing my personal email offline having to wait before I get into the office before sending it on. I felt I could get on with life, even though I was away for work.

The room itself is done out in modern comforting colours. Very smart and upmarket. I liked the comfy chair (see photo). The bed was my only sore point. It was a bit soft to my liking. But the next room I had contained a much better bed. Bathrooms are compact, but stylish and clean. One large chain hotel I stayed in had a huge bathroom and they never bothered to clean under the wash basins! yuch! Nice amenity kits too. Shower (which can hold two) was powerful. Rooms have A/c but the window can open as well so you can get fresh air. The second room I had was on the road side and slightly noiser in the early morning. There was a hum that I could hear at anytime which was the ventelation system I assume. 

Room service was fine and prompt with a very pleasant staff member delivering. He always made a point of saying hello when he saw me in the hotel over the next few days which makes a nice change from being invisible! The food was good, but I'd like to see a daily changing item for all us long stayers! And maybe a pasta dish too. 

Breakfast was efficient and tasty. 3 serials to choose from, a variety of juices, teas and coffee, mini danishes and croissants (just help yourself to as many as you want!) yoghurts, smoked salmon, mortadella, salami and cheeses as well as the full english. The eggs weren't to my liking but the sausages were not your boring standard ones. These were very tasty! Staff were very attentive here also. Check your rate to see if its worthwhile including breakfast or paying separately for it. My Sunday night stay was £90 incl breakfast, but room only was £70 and to buy the full buffet would have been £12.50 (the continental was 8.50, iirc)

There is a small ""fitness room"" which has a basic multi gym, runner and bike along with a few other pieces. Not fantastic, but does the job. 

This hotel is ideally located for those working in/visiting the area bounded by the Castlemead tower in the north, Temple Quay in the south/west and Up to Victoria St in the east. To get to the touristy bits, its a pleasant 10 to 15 min walk. Resturants were a bit lacking nearby, but maybe I didn't know my way round. A bus outside the door can take you to some of the busier areas. 

This is a lovely hotel and if I had to go back for work I'd stay there again. If I came on holiday I would look at the rate offered and what I wanted to see. I may stay elsewhere as a tourist just to be closer to the action, but I'd miss out on all the home comforts offered here and the quality of service from the staff."
2786,Carolyn1696,2006-09-30,3.0,"over expensive My husband and I live in Bristol, but decided that we would have a night away from home.  The romantic package as detailed on the website, whilst expensive, seemed like it would be a nice treat.  There is very limited parking, but luckily, we found a space.  When we got to our room, rose petals had been sprinkled on the bed and the box of chocolates were waiting.  Given that I had spent £195, I expected a larger box, not a box with 9 chocolates in, but all the same a nice touch.  The champagne (which I wouldn't recommend) was on ice, although the ice had melted and had formed an attractive puddle on the desk.  One of the champagne glasses was chipped and there was a card in our room addressed to a Mr Windsor (not me).  Aside from this, the room was small but perfectly adequate and clean and modern.  There was a LCD TV which was small, but good enough, dvd player, cd player and basket of goodies which you should check are all there first otherwise you will get charged.  The bathroom is absolutely tiny, and although the shower is powerful, and yes has room for 2, there is no bath and as I hadn't realised this, a big let down.  Bathrobes are supplied but they are not the nice fluffy, luxurious hotel robes, they are quite scratchy, and at one size only, are very small.  To make matters worse, once my husband had squeezed into his (as I said, they are small) he found a dirty tissue in the pocket - not nice.

DVD's and CD's are available to borrow free from reception and so we borrowed a DVD and curled up on the extremely comfy bed to watch.  As part of the romantic package a 3 course meal was included in the restaurant.  As commented by one previous reviewer, you were made to feel very much as though you could only have from the specific menu, and not upgrade, even if you wanted to - and this certainly wasn't good enough when it came to desert.  The food was very nice, although nothing particularly special and the service wasn't especially good.  one of the other things that was included in the package was a special champagne breakfast in bed.  When we had checked in, nobody asked us what time we wanted breakfast, or what we wanted so on the way upstairs I asked at reception.  They took the time that we wanted breakfast down, but didn't know what was included.

We had a very good nights sleep, but were rudely awaken at 8.30 with our breakfast - we had asked for it at 9.30.  Breakfast consisted of a very small english breakfast, a few small croissant items and some cornflakes. (oh and 2 glasses of the same horrid champagne) - all in all not impressive.  As it turned out, we could have specified what we wanted on the menu in room, and simply hung this on the door which would have given us a much better choice, however we were not told this and consequently left the hotel very hungry.

Had I simply paid the £75 room only price, I would have been perfectly happy with everything, but given the price would have paid for a top notch room at hotel du vin just down the road (albeit not including food) I was rather disappointed.  Would stay here for a quick stop over, but shan't be making a ""romantic"" night of it again."
2787,The_Craven,2006-06-30,4.0,"Enjoyable and Relaxing Stayed here with my girlfriend just before the start of the world cup (get some brownie points before i watched hours of football).  Nice hotel, ive paid allot more and got allot less.

Very nice modern rooms, well equipped with home entertainment systems (DVD player and decent Hifi).  Spacious bathroom, fantastic shower plenty of room for two.  

Some road noise but this had more to do with the low level room over looking a busy road.

One negative Limited Free parking.

2788,NZder_Travels,2006-08-31,3.0,"Reasonable Value for Money My partner and I stayed here for the Balloon Festival Weekend.  It was very handy to the train station being about a 10 minute walk.

The rooms are modern, however smaller than we expected.  The facilities are good in the room with flat screen TV and CD/Radio player.  Bed was comfortable and room was clean.

We didn't eat in the restarant however ordered room service.  The food was presented nicely but we felt it was over priced, especially when you add on the tray service fee.

We were on the first floor and there was a lot of noise from outside late at night from guests departing the bar downstairs.

Biggest gripe is that they held our deposit on our credit card for more than a week after we checked out due to staff not releasing the deposit upon our check out.  I had to follow up with more than 5 phone calls before the charge was released."
2789,jhwt,2006-08-31,3.0,"Excellent value: some fatal flaws! Excellent value at promotion or late rates: some fatal flaws on this visit, so we can only be average/neutral. 

We love the contemporary feel of this “3 star” / “4 star” hotel, the staff and the excellent breakfast. 

Would we visit again? Absolutely – when the doors are fixed / hushed, the building work next door ends & the City Bar has a well ventilated no smoking section. 

We would not pay rack prices for this hotel and we would find it difficult to entertain for business in the City Bar. There is more info in the Bristol TA Forum. 

This hotel rates itself as ""4 star"" and the accommodation standards they used are not yet available to us. However, the AA has awarded 3 stars [74%]. Enjoy England (The official site for English tourism): 3 stars. If we had booked only one night we would not have returned: the first night [26th August] was the worst and totally unacceptable. However, the next two nights were good and then excellent! 

We select four key issues 1] Noise, 2] Smoking and environmental policy, 3] Channel 20: UK “Playboy”, 4] Security / safety. These four issues are “our” fatal flaws in the hotel’s quality standard in relation with a “4 star rating”. 

There are many truths about this hotel's star rating! If we judge it by a 3 star standard it is excellent bar the fatal flaws. If we judge it to 4 star standards it is found wanting in some respects and excels in others. Excellent overall at the hotel was the breakfast in all respects. We encountered none of the comments made previously about breakfast except the issue of the cornflakes. We both found the twin beds very good. However, the “twin” beds are placed next to each other with no gap between. On one side there is a space of only about 20cm and this may not be what you expect from a “twin” room. Housekeeping in the bedroom was very good overall.  The absence of some room features means that, for us, this is not a 4 star style room. We did not eat any of the ""City Temptations"". Oddly it seems that the customer is expected to inform the hotel if any one of the 8 items is missing on arrival immediately or they will be charged for it. We read that 3 days later! Before we rant about specific noise issues it must be pointed out that the hotel is in a quieter location in town than some others more close to the centre. Harbourside and up to Broadmead can get noisy and rowdy on Friday and Saturday evenings. Noise: Stay away from the central and southern rooms. There is a well publicised claim: “high-level sound proofing”. This appears to be about the bedrooms and bedroom facilities. It does not say “soundproof” or “soundproofed”: the verb “soundproofing” is used and therefore it is ambiguous – maybe “towards” it? The sources of noise were multiple, complex and cumulative: mostly they are sporadic, impact noise.1] noise made by the opening closing of the bedroom doors by guests – they close with a load click, clack, slam. If you are unlucky, like us, to be placed near a group or party who shuttle between their allocated rooms you may get no sleep until the doors in the long corridor cease opening and closing. 2] The second source of noise was guest urination and movement of furniture from room 306 above. We did not hear any noise from the entertainment systems. 3] Another source of noise was the collection of rubbish and the delivery of supplies. This can also be combined with taxis waiting, collecting and departing. 4] We also established that the security guard patrols the hotel corridor regularly at night using the emergency fire escape to access the corridor. This activity explains the loud clumping noise I heard periodically – staff need to open and close doors quietly! 5] The door that opens and closes from the lift lobby to the corridor is also very loud and not hushed adequately. Avoid rooms at the centre of the hotel near this door that is in regular use - I can hear it late at night when the corridor is quiet from my “sound proofing” room 206. 6] We were not warned at anytime about the building works on a site adjacent to the hotel and a few metres from our room. The contractors start work early and the hotel needs them to pay and clean the windows! Avoid rooms 106, 206, 306 in particular and anything in the centre or south of the hotel until all these matters are improved or resolved. The Bathroom: Excellent. The City Bar: From conversations with hotel management it appears that this is a smoking bar and that there is no non-smoking provision in the City Bar beyond moving an ashtray off a table! On the first evening of our visit the ventilation in the city bar appeared to fail with the air getting hazy with smoke. We had to leave at midnight and we understand the engineer was called. However, the bar was full with smoking customers and if you are a smoker allocated one of the non smoking rooms you will find this to be the only other practical place to sit, relax and smoke. If you are a non smoker you might check to see if the ventilation is working before drinking here. Channel 20: Free porn channel, UK “Playboy”, if you, or your child, flicks though to channel 20 porn will be displayed at some times. We cannot confirm if this is available before 9pm or not. There is no warning visually or mechanically on the TV. TV info is buried towards the back of the room information manual and unlikely to be read. Safety / Security: The issue with noise from the fire escapes lead us to notice that there are no security cameras on accommodation floors - that we could see. However, this lack of intrusion might find favour with some hotel users and be a possible advantage for them. The cornflakes: The controversy about the cornflakes! The menu states “Kellogg’s cereals”. It does not directly say that the cornflakes are “Kellogg’s”. However, you can decide for yourself if the customer should be forgiven for thinking that his/her breakfast cornflakes should be from Kellogg’s! However, Miki does not like Kellogg’s and preferred whatever these were! Hence we rated this an excellent breakfast!  If you have a “compliant” we suggest you ignore the “feedback” form which seems to be overly prestructured and marketing inspired and simply contact/write to the hotel manager. There is no proper space on the feedback form to write a complaint anyway. Representing the hotel as ""four star"" needs some explanation or explicit criteria of the standards used whether they are in house or otherwise. Warning: beware the £3 tray charge for deliveries to your room! Jerry & Miki"
2790,Marcus2,2006-09-30,4.0,"Reasonable Travel Hotel Myself and my Partner stayed in this hotel on a brief visit to Bristol.

It features well presented, bright if somewhat small rooms with very clean and contempory shower rooms (there are no baths).

LCD Television, DVD player, stereo and SKY channels in each room is more than the norm. And a free library of DVD's and CD's available from the lobby is a neat idea too. 

Service is pleasant and efficient, checkout is hassle free and prices, while a little over what you might pay at other short-stay business orientated hotels, are not unreasonable.

Only minor faults I would say were apparant:

The lobby was perhaps not as polished and as clean as the rooms themselves, which was a little strange. 

The breakfast provided an extensive range of food and drink but certain elements of it weren't great (the scrambled eggs and the coffee were fairly unpleasant to the taste)

Other than these small problems, the hotel provided a good if not grat experienceon the whole.

Recommended for short stay/business guests."

Have stayed at many budget hotels over the years, among which I have found the Holiday Inn Express chain to be about the best. The City Inn reminded me very much of a HIE, but with the added benefits of Flat Screen TV, DVD and CD Players, Bathrobes (not fluffy!),  toiletries and ""dry min-bar"". On the downside, beakfast is not included at City Inn, but is at HIE. The price at City Inn was comparable at £115 for Friday and Saturday nights.

Our daughter's folding bed was not ready when we arrived, but we told reception when we were going out for the evening and it had appeared when we returned later.

Good value and quite satisfactory overall, but not impressed by letter when we arrived home, incorrectly stating that a bottle of water had been taken by us from the dry mini-bar and that £1.65 would be added to our bill. On complaining, was told this would be rectified - remains to be seen!"
2793,ajt22,2006-05-31,5.0,"Excellent stay We needed to stay a few nights in Bristol and searched through hotels. As we'd be communting to Cardiff on the Saturday we needed somewhere fairly central to stay - i.e. near the train station. This criteria was matched as the station was about 5 minutes walk away. Basically, come out of the main entrance to the station walk to the end of that road, turn right, cross the road and the hotels in front of you.

It was very tidy and clean inside as you'd expect, and was also full of all mod cons such as Sky TV (all the BBC ones, ITV/itv2, a few kids stations, CNN, Sky Sports (1-3 and Extra), BBC News 24, Sky News and Playboy) catering for all tastes as well as Internet points, DVD/CD player, radio etc. Not bad at all.

Now, the meals.

What can I say. The evening meal was a total and utter waste of money unless you like rubbish which costs £20 a time. I would not reccommend you eat an evening meal here unless you like minimalist food for top dollar.

Having said that, breakfast was excellent if a little pricey.

I had to chuckle when I read another review on this pay about the Corn Flakes not being Kellogs (as stated on the menu) and being soggy ... but it was accurate.

However, everything else was spot on. You help your self to the wide selection of cooked, continental or fruity breakfast. Top marks for this. 

Staff were helpful and friendly as you'd expect."

There were only a couple of very minor drawbacks, but there will be with any hotel.  The bathroom was on the small side, but very clean, servicable and perfectly decorated.

City centre approx 5-10 minutes walking distance, train station 10-15 min walk and buses are close by.

2797,CentreOfUniverse,2006-04-30,4.0,"Clean and Modern, but on the edge of the action. The Hotel is very clean indeed and has very modern 'minimalist' decor. The standard rooms are not particularly big, but adequate. The wardrobe space is limited. The bathroom with shower was good.  

You get a kettle, DVD player and small flat-screen TV, plus a CD player as standard. CD's and DVD can be borrowed free of charge from reception. The reception staff are helpful but not as clued up on the local attractions and bus routes etc. as you might think.

Temple Mead station is a short walk but you must exit the station by a hidden back route. A Ferry to the city centre also stops nearby.

The Hotel has several drawbacks. Firstly, the rate is pretty good, but often does NOT include breakfast. The breakfast is very expensive at £12.50 for a hot buffet and £8 for continental.  Secondly, it is a good 10-15 mins walk from the centre of town. Hoiwever it is in a quite location. Parking is limited.  

I did not try the CirtyInn (its Restaurant) but it looked expensive. There is a nice Indian Restaurant opposite Temple mead Station.

- The breakfast was not as good as I was expecting from a hotel of 4 star standard. The corn flakes offered were 'spongy' and definately not Kellog's cereal as claimed on the breakfast menu at the hotel.

Soon I noticed that although I turned the air conditionning off, it was still fully functional. I was not able to change room due to limited availability for ""my offer"" (160 Euros!!).

Otherwise, I shared some of the recent opinions already posted on tripadvisor about the service: Breakfast although unexpected diverse for the UK was ok, but service was unavailable.

For our weekend stay, involving day trips out of Bristol, the location was excellent (close to Temple Meads railway station, but within walking distance of the city centre shopping and nightlife).

Rooms are bright, modern and attractive, compact but not cramped for two people, and well-equipped - LCD TV, DVD and CD players (free rental of discs from reception). There is complimentary broadband internet access (wired in the bedrooms and wireless in the ground floor public areas). Other reviewers have commented on the lack of wardrobe space - yes, smaller than average, but fine for a short stay. The rooms appear to be all of an identical standard and size. The bathroom is a reasonably-sized showerroom, with a powerful shower and mist-free mirror.

The advertised soundproofing of the rooms seemed to work well, with almost nothing noticeable from adjoining rooms, and just the occasional slamming door from the corridor. However we were on the quieter side of the building (west, overlooking Temple Church) rather than the other side which has the busy dual carriageway of Temple Way. The window blocked out most outside noise but I would expect some traffic noise to get through.

Though generally the room was clean and well-maintained, the housekeeping was haphazard - when we checked in, the previous guest's rubbish hadn't been removed, or the ""mini bar"" of snacks restocked (and they later attempted to charge us for the missing bag of Kettle Chips!). We had a pair of towels removed after the first morning and had to get replacements delivered. Other niggles were that not all of the advertised tv channels were tuned in and descrambled, and there was no teletext on the tv.

Breakfast was included in our rate, and was a good range of continental and cooked items. Only downside was having to pass through the smokers' enclave (the bar) to get in or out of the restaurant. We didn't have any other meals in the restaurant or try the fitness room.

Overall, good value for money and I'd certainly stay in a City Inn again."
2801,Odyssey37099,2006-04-30,1.0,"Don't do it! Myself and partner used this as a half way point on the way home after a relaxing week in cornwall, big mistake. Room was ok, but service was terrible. we had booked the Spring deal of DBB. When we sat for dinner the restaurant manager was very nice until he realised we had booked this package. He promptly told us which menu we could have and that we were not allowed to order from the ala carte menu. When i tried to order a nice bottle of red he told me it was not possible to use our offer of a free bottle that had been given to us against it. I said I knew this and still wanted the nice bottle i requested, but he still stood there telling me that I would not even get a discount off it! I didn't ask for one I just wanted the wine. I was left feeling ashamed to be there. The food was average and the service was poor from the waiters. We asked for breakfast in our room, which came with coffee instead of the ordered tea and only 1 set of cutlery. when my partner phoned down to rectify this the man sighed and put the phone down without saying anything. 

On checking out I was still polite amazingly and just wanted to leave but on checking the bill we had ironically been charged an extra £16.50 for something off the ala carte menu, and when I pointed this out the receptionist looked very stern (sighed) checked receipts and eventually printed of a new bill with no apologies. Needless to say we felt the need to go back to cornwall to relax again. Oh and the waiter was called Manuel, fitting."
2802,GeoffR,2006-04-30,3.0,"Cool, clean but maybe not ""4 Star Deluxe"" This hotel claims to be ""4 Star Deluxe"", whilst it is good, it is certainly not in that class.

Our 3 night stay was at a very good rate (average £75 plus breakfast) in a double room. The room was adequately sized although seriously lacking in storage  space (and if you bring your clothes on their own hangers there is nowhere to hang them and you will have to tranbfer them to the hotel's hangers for the specially appointed hanging areas).

Adequate in size with a 6ft bed,  but smaller than Americans might expect, the room has TV, DVD, CD/Radio and all the usual other stuff.

Interestingly, for a ""4 Star Deluxe"" the sheets were not big enough to tuck into the bed and pulled free during the night - I would expect a hotel with these claims to have big enough sheets!

Reception staff were very helpful and friendly, especially as they seemed to be doubling for the non-existent concierge (there was a desk but I never saw anyone there).

City Cafe is very good - well above average hotel dinner.

This is hotel is modern, cold, spartan and that suits many - don't expect chintz and old-fashioned style. I would rate it as an upmarket business hotel or for short stays rather than a suitable base for longer holidays."
2803,kbhr,2006-02-28,3.0,"A bit hit and miss Booked direct with the hotel online a bit last minute so probably could have shopped around but thought UKP 130 quite overpriced for standard of accommodation. Room size was adequate but not much floor space between bed, table and dressing table. Flat screen was quite small but very clear as the bed wasn't very far from it! Made use of the free DVD's on offer and both films we requested were available and there is internet access if you have a laptop. Staff at the reception desk were very helpful, providing free map and directions. We had a quick bite in the bar in the afternoon and were impressed with the food so booked table at the restaurant for dinner that evening. Requested table for 8pm but told could only book 8.30 so went for that. Arrived at 8.30 and the room was only about a 1/5th full. Before ordering were told that they were sold out of the pork and beef which took out a good deal of choice from the menu. Ordered their signature dish of scallops as a starter and told they had just sold out of that also, 2 minutes prior. Not sure how this is possible with a room only a 5th full. Food we did order was very nice though. Shower was good, with nice toiletries by The White Company. Word of warning - don't overpack! The wardrobes are little more than decoration with a depth about the size of the average shelf. Ordered 2 papers for the Sunday morning, only 1 arrived with half of it missing. Buffet breakfast was better than average. Think the hotel is best suited for the business traveller but for no more than a few nights."
2804,Curious23492,2006-01-31,4.0,"Better than most I have stayed in most Bristol city centre hotels over the last few months on business.  This is one of the best.

Good points: Quiet location.  Good in-room entertainment, particularly sports.  Room was clean, well-maintained.  Room was above average size.  CD player/LCD TV/DVD player in room might be useful for longer stay customers - I suspect they're more 'impressive' than 'useful' for most customers.

Downsides:  Not particularly quiet within the hotel itself; lots of mechanical sounding bumping and clanging.  Given a smoking room when specifically requested non-smoking; they were able to change it but what is the point requesting it if they ignore it and if I'd ended up checking in an hour later I'd have been stuck in an ashtray for the night.  That's so important to me - the hotel loses a grade.  Not cheap, in fact unreasonably expensive, at £120/night."
2805,kranjan,2006-01-31,5.0,"Great Hotel, Great Value, Excellent Location! We decided to visit Wessex county as a weekend getaway, with the focus of the visit being Bath.   However we quickly found that Bath hotels were quite expensive and our budget was £<60 per night.  

We found the city in Bristol, having read the reviews we thought it might be a safe bet.  When we arrived there we found the hotel is located just east of the city centre.  We arrived at the hotel at around 10:30pm and found jsut a few parking spots left in the hotel parking lot.  We parked just next to the building, although these spots are not marked for parking, the hotel is very accomodating.  The 2nd night when their lot was full the reception staff very kindly pointed us to free lot across the street, but there is also parking on the side street just around the cornor if that is full.  

Aside from parking we found the hotel to be extremly clean, the bathroom reasonably big for UK standards.  The shower pressure was excellent, although we did find that the shower temperature changed from hot to warm if someone else used the sink, a minor inconveiniance, but unnoticable.   Rooms are average size and big for UK standards (compared to London). The beds are large and very comfortable.  

They have LCDs with DVD players in the room which is a nice touch, although the LCDs are extermely small and some may struggle to see it clearly from across the room.   They do have a good selection of DVDs at reception that are FREE to rent for guests - a very nice touch.  

We did read in the reviews that the resteruant/bar was a bit pricey so we avoided dining at the hotel altogether.  However, there is a street just about 10 minutes walking distance along the river which has several nice resteruants and lots of bars to get a drink.     

Overall we were exteremly pleased with our stay and would highly reccomend it!"
2806,geoconger,2005-06-30,4.0,"Pleasant Found a good deal on a last minute room.  Very nice public rooms and restaurant.  Given a smoking room by mistake --- and the staff was very prompt in changing it to a non-smoking room.

Very nice central location.  

Room clean and rather large.  Nicely done -- lovely wood furnishings.

Bit of a crowd at check-in, check-out ... could use more front desk staff.

2807,Passport11571,2005-12-31,5.0,"Loved it - just avoid the bar! Stayed here with my partner just before Christmas and was very impressed. The room was clean and nicely decorated with a few nice little extras. I was particularly surprised at the range of channels on the TV (Sky One, Sky Sports etc), having expected just the standard free ones (BBC 3, E4 etc.). 
The bathroom was very clean and adequetly sized (for future reference, you can fit 2 people in the shower!!). The only disappointment was the lack of a bath. The breakfast was both extensive and delicious, albeit quite expensive (£24 for a fry-up and continental beakfast delivered to the room).

My only real complaint is that it's very easy to spend a lot of money here. A pint of Carlsberg Export and glass of Rioja cost me £9.75! Likewise, a 330ml bottle of water in the room will cost you over £1! The restaurant too is quite expensive so we ate elsewhere.

In summary, this is a lovely hotel - just be cautious when asked ""Can I charge this to your room?"""
2808,SFvegetarian,2005-11-30,5.0,"A Nice, Modern Hotel, above expectations... A very nice place to stay in Bristol. It becomes outstanding if you can get a good deal, as we did in November. We had 2 rooms, both were excellent, clean, modern and tasteful. The staff was very friendly and very helpful.  We needed some maps, they copied theirs for us and brought them up to our room. The lounge/pub is comfortable and lively, the restaurant is good, but very expensive for Americans ($40 for an entree) with our weak dollar. The rooms are modern with a very nice flatscreen TV, a decent amount of cable channels, free DVDs available at the front desk, a CD player/stereo, nice robes, some free snacks, good sized bathrooms (for europe), and many other nice surprises. The free breakfast buffet was well above expectations, with a very hearty selection of eggs, beans, vegetarian sausages, real bacon and sausage, mushrooms, potatoes, fruit, breads, cheese, cereals, rolls, etc.  The food was of good quality and there were plenty of choices. The location was excellent for getting out of town quickly to roadtrip to Bath, Stonehenge, Cheddar, Wells, etc, and is near a lovely park and downtown esplanade.  The Bristol nightlife was absolutely wild, as the college kids were partying loud , drunk, and late on the weekend nights, it was dead by 10 pm on weeknights.
All in all, we would definitely stay here again."
2809,Trip35121,2005-11-30,4.0,Keep the eye on the ball The city inn is my usual stop over whilst in Bristol - stayed there a dozen or so times over the last year or so. Excellent location for the station & if arriving by car you can use the car-park for as long as you want ( even after check out) which is very useful. As for the review - starting with the car park - just prey there is an easy space to slip into - the hotel do not enforse their own parking rules meaning parking can be an issue. Check in is always as it should be - wake up call / newspapers/ book for dinner / check your home address to faciliate express check out - so top marks. The hotel is about three - four  years old and the decor is still fresh as are the well appointed rooms - flat screen TV / DVD & CD players / comfy chair / fluffy gowan / small very bright shower room - OK for a night or two - if i was being picky I would say the rooms do need a little TLC ( new light shades etc but on the whole excellent. The cafe food of an evening is well presented but really over priced - £4.50 for very nice tomato soup / £10.50 for fish & eight ( yes 8) chips - so not good value - but nice surroundings. Breakfast OK but more presentation than content. Certainly a nice place to stay if someone else is footing the bill & you are not too hungry. Will be back but will dine out next time.
2810,UlsteronTour,2005-10-31,5.0,"Gorgeous modern Hotel We will definitely be returning to the city Inn. Admittedly, we would not normally stay in a Hotel in this price range but were able to get a special late availability deal.

We were taken aback by the comfort of the Hotel. Very luxurious throughout complete with a very atmospheric bar.

The Hotel staff were very helpful and allowed us to check in early at no extra charge - very welcome after an early start! Great room facilities and very handy location for Temple Meads Railway station.

My only problem now is that my other half wont allow me to take her ANYWHERE else next time we are in Bristol."
2811,Almatt,2005-09-30,4.0,"Nice! I stayed here for one night in September. It's a very modern hotel with great gadgets as other reviewers have described.  My room was a bit small but perfectly adequate. It was also very quiet - luck of the draw, I guess.  Great central location. Only downside was that there was no bath but, in fairness, the shower was good.  Good room service - extensive menu and very prompt. Good breakfast.  I will continue to book this hotel when I go to Bristol."

I have stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions, yes the rooms are a bit sterile and on the small side, but the Reception Manager and her team more than make up for it!

We were able to get a special rate through the website and I'm glad to say it was all very worth it.  We didn't eat at the hotel or order room service, mostly to do with the fact we were seeing freinds all weekend.  The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean.  The staff are freindly and helpful.  There isn't ample car parking, however there is a pay and display car park across the street so its not so bad."

The rooms are clean and bright with modern furnishings including the small widescreen TV.  The bed was very comfortable and is a highlight of the room.  The rooms are on the small side which is fine if only staying for one night but might be annoying if staying longer.
I view it almost like an upmarket Travel Lodge/Inn good for business travellers or for short/functional leisure stays when you will only be using the room to sleep etc and not planning to stay in the hotel most of the weekend.
The rooms claim to be very soundproof, we did here some noise from the corridor but nothing much."

2819,RoamingScot,2005-04-30,3.0,"So near ... I stayed at the City Inn for a few nights a month or two ago. There are some plus points about it, but also some things which are not so good.

Good points :

- Rooms are clean and modern
- (Smallish) widscreen TV and DVD player in each room
- Free broadband internet from each room (and wireless in public areas)
- Comfortable double bed

But :

- Rooms are very small. The bed may be a double, but there isn't really space for two people to move around without colliding all the time. The bathroom is absolutely tiny, too, and has only got a shower - no bath.
- Free porn channel on the TV. Some might regard it as a plus, but I didn't appreciate finding this with no warning while channel hopping. Reception also told me that there was no way of blocking access to the channel from the room.
- No way to set a wakeup call, through the TV or the phone. 

There were other minor annoyances in the room, like built in coat hangers which fell out at the slightest provocation. The rooms looked nice, but they just weren't very well though out from a practical point of view.

Coupled to this, I had some problem or other each time I stayed - being allocated a smoking room when I had asked for a non-smoking, and so on.

The end result was that I just got irritated with the place. With more space in the room, and some more thought for the practicalities, it could be a really good hotel. As it is, it's OK for a night or two as somewhere to put your head, but don't expect too much."

The rooms are very clean and comfortable and the complimentary bottle of wine is a winner. I would certainly have scored this hotel higher if it wasn't for the fact that I didn't get any sleep for the two nights we stayed there. Both nights I was awoken by other guests who were shouting on the corridors, slamming doors and basically causing a disturbance. The reception staff were excellent but unfortunately couldn't keep the noise down. By way of compensation we got the second night free, but by then we just wanted to go home and sleep."
2822,Safari9756,2004-11-26,4.0,"Great staff, okay hotel Stayed here for one night in October 2004.  The staff were excellent: the receptionist went out of his way to let us check in early even though we'd only turned up to leave our luggage until the proper check in time, and everyone else we met was friendly and very efficient.

The room was okay: it was quite small and to be honest it was a bit like a good student hall of residence... nice big comfy bed, though, and the en suite was small but nice.

Dinner was excellent!  Although we were less keen on the breakfast.

Probably a better hotel for business travel than leisure, as it's a bit pricey for what you get."

Still, the staff on the desk are helpful and pleasant. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the City Centre or Broadmead, but quite a long way from the Clifton Tourist District (catch the bus from Victoria Street and not outside the Hotel). Don't bother drinking here, as there are two nice historic pubs close by, the Shakespeare and Seven Stars which are a lot cheaper. OK for a 2-3 night stay !"

The result was all the items on the plate were cold by the time we got back to the table. I particularly don’t enjoy cold baked beans!"
17,Francis,2024-04-15,4.5,"it was a nice stay Room was ample ,quite, had a view of the park which was part of a historical church. the room could have been a bit bigger for the price ."
18,Sesan,2024-04-12,4.5,Superb The staff were brilliant! The breakfast was very good. The bed in the room was a bit small. The AC did not work very well.
19,Shane,2024-04-11,4.0,"Very good Great staff, warm welcome, personable. Nicely appointed room. Excellent breakfast selection. Close to train station. Would definitely stay again. Air con was unpredictable and bed was a little rickety."
20,Daniel,2024-04-07,3.5,Good The bed was comfy the shower nice Not being able to park and walking ages to another car park and having no funding from the hotel to compensate for the parking charges like other hotels do
21,Salomonh,2024-04-06,4.5,"Perfect for our stay Close to the railway station and not far from centre we enjoyed our stay very much. Nice Staff (eg Dilara and Navi), very good breakfast quality, a comfortable bed and a good shower was provided. Even though we were facing a busy street quality windows allowed us to sleep very well. Socket was only provided at one side of the bed and not on both but there were plenty other sockets all around the room."
22,Joyce,2024-04-05,4.0,Very good Very helpful and friendly staff
23,Ana,2024-04-03,3.5,"Enjoyed our stay The staff was very friendly and the breakfast options were very good! One of the elevators was not working, the heating was not working (we were asked if we wanted to change rooms or a portable heater) and the TV remote was also not working (although they provided new batteries)"
24,Ulrike,2024-04-03,4.0,"Very good Very helpful staff, very nice breakfast and ideal for the station and the Airport."
25,Fiona,2024-04-03,4.5,"Would return Check in was polite, bar area was clean however did have to wait quite a while for service however. Breakfast was good but no vegan options. No vegan options at breakfast"
26,Lorraine,2024-04-01,3.5,"Good choice for a brief visit Good location, handy for train station. Dinner and breakfast were only ok."
27,Sunil,2024-04-01,4.5,Great for Business travellers like me. Great location. Everything is within walking distance.
28,Robert,2024-03-27,4.5,"Overnight in Bristol. Good quality chain hotel in the centre of Bristol. We have stayed here before, and it does everything it says on the tin. Good breakfast, with plenty of variety. The car park is very easy to see, but exceedingly difficult to find!"
29,Charlotte,2024-03-25,3.5,"Nice hotel, comfortable and good value Breakfast was good value and reception staff very helpful Really hard to find on the satnav"
30,Laura,2024-03-25,4.0,Decent stay Nice room and breakfast. The road towards the hotel was closed and no instructions were displayed. We almost missed the event we travelled for trying to find the hotel.
31,Sam,2024-03-24,4.0,"Good value, clean hotel with delicious breakfast Great breakfasts, very helpful staff Hard beds"
32,Diana,2024-03-21,4.5,"Would stay again The Hotel is easy walking distance from Bristol Temple Meads station. The reception staff was very welcoming and helpful. We were given a map and had an explanation how the get to our venue for the evening without really having to ask for it. The walk into the old town part was short. The room was clean and well arranged. The breakfast was good. The room was very warm and we did not seem to be able to get the A/C to cool it down. Maybe it was just us... but I mentioned it as we checked out and felt that my comment was being taken serious. A couple of things ran out during breakfast, and we were by no means late, and weren't replenished whilst we ate. We still manged to fill out tummies no problem though."
33,Seeseetv,2024-03-21,4.0,"Perfect for business overnight stay Great central location, onsite parking though chargeable More info on available car charging points would have been useful, didn't work on arrival but reception did manage to resolves so we could charge the car"
34,Tracey,2024-03-21,4.5,Great would stay there again Distance from city and staff were fantastic
35,Dan,2024-03-18,4.0,Very good Great location. Nice breakfast. Slightly small room but not disastrous.
36,Ashleigh,2024-03-16,3.5,Not great  Room right next to the lift and noise from the lift kept us awake all night . Requested a late check out of 12 agreed. Then hammering on the door constantly from 11 am would like twice about staying here again.
37,Debra,2024-03-13,4.5,"Superb The staff were sp friendly, yhe food in the restaurant was lovely😍. The sausages at breakfast were very anaemic"
38,Francesca,2024-03-11,3.5,"Good Good location, comfortable bed, didn’t mind me checking in at 11pm. My room had a nice view over a park which at night had the trees adorned with lights. The bathroom although clean was so tiny and very dated."
39,Lukrecia,2024-03-10,4.0,"Perfect location for town and the train station We stayed at the hotel overnight prior to catching a flight. The hotel is perfectly located - a few minutes walk from the train station and a short stroll from town. The staff on reception and in the restaurant were very attentive, polite and professional. We enjoyed our stay."
40,David,2024-03-07,4.5,"High quality central hotel offering excellent value for money The receptionist lady (sounded Dutch) was very wlecoming and moved us to a room overlooking the garden at the back. We only stayed one night as I was going to a concert at the Bristol Beacon and my wife was meeting old friends who live bear Bristol. The central location is perfect for the entertainment areas of the City and the local bars restaurants etc offer a range of cuisine and atmosphere. Breakfast options were good though both coffee machines were broken - a kind staff lady made us both coffees from a machine behind the bar Will definitely stay there again. The power on the shower was rather too weak to wash my wife's very thick hair. This was at least partially the result of the head leaking. Some of the wall tiles were cracked (Room 106) as was the shower basin, both probably the result of movement at some point. I reported all this on departure."
41,Amanda,2024-03-07,4.0,"Very good Breakfast was fabulous, staff were very helpful and pleasant"
42,Kayleigh,2024-03-06,4.5,As above Everything was fab. Food to the room (from the bar/restaurant) was delicious and all staff were very friendly
43,Nicola,2024-03-04,4.5,Superb The location
44,Rachel,2024-03-04,3.5,"Good room was good enough, suitable for my stay, location and breakfast was great the parking cost was only obvious after I had reserved the room, it was fine but a bit more transparency would be appreciated"
45,Robert,2024-03-04,4.5,"Good hotel Great location, friendly staff, very comfortable beds, decent breakfast Parking at £20 a night is somewhat steep"

47,Williams,2024-03-04,4.0,"Will definitely be back Comfy beds, good showers, lovely toiletries, great location, helpful staff. Slightly short on staff at breakfast and gloopy porridge (but rest of breakfast good)"
48,Kayleigh,2024-03-03,3.5,"Cleaned and suitable for an overnight stay in the city Easy and friendly check in. Clean and tidy room The bed was very squeaky, everytime you moved over in bed it made a noise which didn’t make for the best nights sleep"
49,Martina,2024-03-02,4.0,"Very good Staff friendliness, location, great breakfast Bathroom very small, rooms smaller than look on website"
50,Diane,2024-02-29,4.0,Good  Having to wait for breakfast while the coach trip were occupieing the whole restaurant
51,Andy,2024-02-28,4.0,"Comfy hotel near to Bristol station Bed was comfy and lots of storage space. The breakfast was good and had lots of options. Staff were friendly and let me store my bicycle in the store room over night which was a big plus. check in and check out were quick and easy. Only thing I didn't like was the design of the floor tiles in the bathroom for safety reasons, they're white with a design that looks like splashes of water. So it looks like there's water on the floor but isn't, but when there IS water on the floor, you can't see it"
52,Jenny,2024-02-26,4.0,"Adequate with reservations The room was fine, if a little cramped for two people. There were sufficient towels and soaps, etc. Although facing the busy road, the room was quiet. The reception staff were very pleasant, if rather slow in checking in & out. The hotel charge was adequate for the services we received. Bottled water was provided. There were no USB ports in the room, surprising for an obvious business hotel. There was a fridge but it had been turned off. There were limited channels on the TV. We were encouraged to have lunch in the restaurant but when we arrived just before 12:00 we were asked to sit in a corner as they were still clearing away after breakfast. Whilst eating the cleaner progressed with a noisy vacuum cleaner across the breakfast area and then arrived at the corner we were seated at. She proceeded to vacuum around our table and even under our feet whilst we ate! We booked the hotel because the car park had EV points. I know they could not guarantee one would be available but we found none of the 3 points usable and had to go to a local supermarket and sit for an hour to recharge. We did not have breakfast as the lunch we had the day before was most unappetising. Inferior ingredients and tasteless."
53,David,2024-02-25,3.5,fair hotel but too expensive Nice staff location cold room breakfast not great tv was poor
54,Andy,2024-02-25,3.5,Good Location Disorganised breakfast arrangement Broken arm rest on chair in the room. Light on the TV where it has probably been damaged
55,Mcgeough,2024-02-25,3.5,"CLEAN AND FUNCTIONAL - A GOOD BUSINESS HOTEL A comfortable business hotel, very clean. Breakfast - could offer vegetarian options, and dairy alternatives. I asked for the oat milk and the memebr of staff wehnt off and don't bother to return. Breakfast - could offer vegetarian options, and dairy alternatives. I asked for the oat milk and the member of staff went off and don't bother to return A little further from the centre of town than expected, travel time doubles during traffic."
56,Alan,2024-02-23,4.0,"Convenient location, comfortable room, easy to use facilities but a little overpriced (in my view) I booked this hotel for its location just 10 mins walk from my company's office and less than 30 mins walk to the harbourside area too. Everything was simple and straight forward, staff were friendly and efficient, room was clean and comfortable, breakfast was of a good standard and served from 6am - great for an early start. Small niggles - no small cups for espressos at breakfast. No soft or dimmable lighting in the room (or at least, I didint find it) Similar to many hotel chains, I feel it was a little over-priced."
57,Rachel,2024-02-22,4.0,"Great location, good value. Clean. Great location! Easy walk from temple meads and city centre."
58,Wendy,2024-02-21,4.5,Great stay. Good location near railway station not to far into Bristol town centre.Comfortable room very quiet even thou our room was on the road side. All the hotel colleagues were friendly and helpful especially Navi who was on duty in the morning for breakfast. Can’t really think of anything negative.
59,Peter,2024-02-18,4.5,Superb Excellent location to transport and restaurants.
60,Tim,2024-02-18,4.0,Very good Location close to city centre Tiny bathroom

62,Brad,2024-02-17,4.5,"Great location and good staff Location, staff Broken light in room, room upgrade to king didn’t feel like much of an upgrade"
63,Louise,2024-02-16,4.5,"Perfect, out of town, within easy reach of town stay. The property is ideal for us, as we travel by train. 5 mins walk tops, and we’re at the hotel. It’s a bit further into town, but still very central. Some lovely areas to pass through and things to see on the way. It’s a quiet hotel and the staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was pleasant. Nothing"
64,Joseph,2024-02-14,3.5,"The day was good. The breakfast was good, the staff excellent. Paying an extra £20 for parking"

67,Roger,2024-02-14,3.5,"Good On site parking, albeit £20 per 24 hours. Great location. Quiet room. Breakfast was average for a 4 star hotel."
68,Samantha,2024-02-12,4.0,"Very good Shared facilities were lovely. The breakfast was very good, lots of variety. Great location for heading to the shopping centre or the theatre which is what we were there for. The reception staff were very welcoming and accommodating too. The room was a little tired in places and needed some updating. Wonky switches, toilet roll holder, paint chipped off the skirting. It could have done with better sound proofing too, we could hear the couple above us quite clearly!"
69,Andy,2024-02-11,4.5,"Ideal spot for a weekend visit. Great location, close to the train station and the city centre, but also quiet enough to have a relaxing stay. The team were incredibly helpful and friendly from start to finish, and the breakfast was good to wake up to Late night room service would have been helpful, but we were able to order in Uber Eats, so there was a suitable alternative. The front desk were very happy to suggest this."

76,John,2024-02-03,4.5,"Would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel. The location is excellent. Within easy walking distance to restaurants and pubs and The Fleece where we had booked to see a show. Very good breakfast included in the price. Finding the place was a bit of a nightmare but, to be fair this was aggravated by all the construction work going on in the area. To my mind the car parking charge of £20 per 24 hours is a bit of a liberty. Although the breakfast was first-class the organisation was a bit chaotic."
77,Lizzie,2024-02-01,4.5,"Relaxing time with my sister Modern, spacious, clean Creaky beds! We did sleep well though so that’s good. Reception staff not massively friendly, could be a bit friendlier"

95,Mykhailo,2024-01-15,4.0,"Very good Overall experience is good, however we had expected a little bit better. The hotel has not been renovated for a while and it doesn't feel like 4-stars accommodation. But the breakfast was excellent and the staff were very helpful."

98,Terry,2024-01-13,4.0,I enjoy staying at the Hilton Garden. But feel it isn’t quite as good as it once was. Easy access to train station. Clean and tidy. The room was cold. And didn’t warm up all night. And breakfast needed to be hotter. The bacon was so cold I couldn’t cut it.

103,Jessica,2024-01-03,3.5,"It was a nice stay in a good location It's in a good central location. The room was nice, the bathroom was a little small and kind of in a corner with no bath just a shower cubical in the wall but it was sufficient for my needs. Parking is very limited and was full when I arrived at 9pm, I tried calling the hotel for help on where to park but was given directions as if I was a local which I struggled to follow in the dark in my car so I ended up searching for the nearest NCP carpark which was about 10 min walk away in the rain with my bags which wasn't ideal after a long trip to get there."
104,Chris,2024-01-03,4.5,"Waffles,waffles,breakfast is king! Central, clean and friendly £20 to park overnight but to be fair it’s very close to the train station!"

Breakfast was basic but fresh. We enjoyed our 2 night stay. Highly recommended. Dinner was awful. My salmon tasted sour and my partner roast was Bland and dry. Gravy like water with no colour and body to it. Dissapointed!"
107,Juliet,2023-12-31,4.0,"Clean and well appointed room, friendly staff. Friendly staff, very clean, well appointed room, easy to park. Despite being on a very busy main road, it was quiet in the rooms. Breakfast was reasonable but no butter on the first morning and staff (whilst very friendly) didn't keep on top of making sure there was cutlery on tables, plates available at some of the food stations etc. A minor grumble, but some attention to detail lacking. Location not the best, on a main road with a fair walk to city centre ( we are happy walking, but others might not be) Parking expensive - £20 per day."
108,Alastair,2023-12-30,3.5,A comfortable stay. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. Trying to find my way into the car park took a long time as not signposted that need to go round a load of back streets to get to it.

111,Ann,2023-12-24,4.0,A good city centre hotel. Room was clean and comfortable with a very good en suite. views over the city were good. Staff were very attentive and helpful with an excellent balance between friendliness and professionalism We struggled to find the parking at the hotel but this was probably due to the number of roadworks. Breakfast was a little disappointing as we felt that some of the food had been sitting in the hot buffet too long
112,Isabelle,2023-12-23,3.5,Ok Location Heating didn’t work. G Hotel provided heater and blanket Fan stayed on all night - noisy Restaurant staff were not very engaging - sit anywhere and no more info about where items were or how breakfast service worked.

116,Leo,2023-12-18,4.0,"Superb staff and good location. All staff were pleasant. The lady on reception when we arrived was particularly helpful on several occasions. The hotel location was ideal for us, being a very short walk from the station and close to a music venue we had tickets for. Bars and eateries close by too. This was not exactly a big problem or dislike, but it would have been nice to have an electrical socket on both sides of the bed."
117,Gabriel,2023-12-17,4.5,"Clean, comfortable, value for money. Comfortable and clean. Easy to get to from the venue of the wedding we attended. Light in room didn't seem to work but had lamps so didn't bother us."

127,Melina,2023-12-06,4.0,"Very good The staff was friendly and I generally liked the room. The breakfast buffet offered the perfect start to the day! It was a bit cold in the room.

133,Emma,2023-11-27,3.5,"Ok for short stay Handy location, short walk from the station and to the centre. Staff were friendly and helpful. Small room and bathroom, bed was a bit hard. Seemed more like a travel Inn than a Hilton hotel. Expensive considering size and basic nature of the room (even though it was a Queen room apparently). Breakfast area seemed a bit chaotic and rowdy."
134,Julie,2023-11-27,4.5,"Superb The staff were exceptional at this hotel, especially Peter on reception. Great location too!"

136,Jean,2023-11-23,4.5,Four of us had a short but very enjoyable stay and would certainly return whenever we are in Bristol The room was a little small and the bathroom very small. However they included everything necessary and were very clean so nothing to complain about. The breakfast was excellent especially the offer of omelettes and poached eggs to order. A special mention must be made of Ash (Subash?). He went out of his way to ensure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Exceptional employee. Small size of bathroom but it did have a great magnified mirror. Not enough comfortable chairs in the bar area.
137,Richard,2023-11-22,4.0,I’d book again Location and value Prefer bath to showers
138,Paul,2023-11-21,4.5,"Overall very happy with our stay. Staff very helpful and friendly Breakfast choice/omelettes Clean Close to station /park Free overnight parking close by Bed size, previously stayed in room with bigger bed"
139,Andrew,2023-11-20,4.5,"Pleasant, fair price Clean, comfortable room. Staff changed our room when the temperature in the original one couldn't be reduced. Breakfast good. Very friendly and helpful staff. Not possible to reduce temperature in original room."
140,Jeannette,2023-11-20,3.5,"Comfortable hotel best suited for business travellers I stayed one night for business. The room was fine, clean and comfortable, with tea making facilities in the room. Great breakfast selection and very welcoming staff. Although perfectly comfortable, the room was very beige, with almost office-like furniture. Good for a business trip, but for a leisure visit I would expect more for the price. The location is not very inspiring, but near the station, which suited my needs."
141,Alan,2023-11-20,3.5,Good Location and staff
142,Penny,2023-11-19,4.5,"Comfortable, pleasant staff, good breakfast Near to the station, contemporary decor (lovely smell in the reception areas!), pleasant staff and great breakfast. Breakfast layout rather confusing and lots of items had run out"
143,Dawn,2023-11-19,3.5,Good The hotel is in a good location near the station and a short walk into the center of Bristol. The room was clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was very good. The staff were helpful and friendly.
144,Eddie-e,2023-11-19,4.5,Bristol bomboolash Good location near station. 10 mins walk into town. Easy check in. Nothing
145,Adele,2023-11-19,4.5,Great location for city break It was a good location close to old town and harbour with parking
146,Julie,2023-11-17,4.5,"Great location, Great breakfast The smell of the hotel was fabulous. there was an atomiser near the lift. smelt gorgeous. Staff were friendly and helpful Location was perfect. The waffle maker for breakfast was brilliant. nom The view from our window was probably the worst we've ever had. building work and scaffolding to building next door. was a shame, but unavoidable. didn't detract from room particularly as was just a place to rest our heads. The coffee machine wasn't working so couldn't easily get a cuppa, then another, as a member of staff had to work the only hot drink machine behind the bar"
147,Colin,2023-11-16,3.5,"Overall a positive experience, spoiled only by inattentive breakfast staff The check-in and check-out were very smooth and the gentlemen on reception was extremely helpful and efficient. Room was perfect for what I needed, very clean and comfortable, and the location of the hotel was perfect for my needs. Car parking was also very handy and worked well. Long wait to get a table for breakfast - not because of the lack of tables, but because there was nobody there to attend to the waiting guests. Empty tables were not being cleared and re-set, so when someone did finally take me to a table, I had to wait again while the table was cleared and re-set. The person doing that did not seem to recognise that a lot of people were waiting and did not seem to be in a hurry to get fresh tables ready. For a hotel of this category, I would have expected a lot more."
148,H,2023-11-13,3.5,Long weekend in Bristol. It was a short walk to the centre of Bristol. The noise from possibly the lift mechanism or air conditioning unit. We were on the 5th floor next to the elevators.
149,David,2023-11-13,4.0,Just the job Room was fine. Location excellent for town and railway station Breakfast was good Nothing
150,Em,2023-11-13,4.0,"Perfect for visiting the city Great location and parking Staff were superb. Friendly helpful and food in restaurant, room service and breakfast was great too. Bed was hard for me and also heating didn’t work but we managed to get a heater and extra duvet easily and sorted that out."
151,Dan,2023-11-13,4.0,"A good venue, with all what was needed, giving a good base for a quick visit. The location was good, friendly staff, convenient bar. Breakfast was decent too. Initially the wrong room was provided; with a double bed instead of 2 singles provided, but this was resolved, although mainly by my colleagues' quick thinking."
152,Tracy,2023-11-12,3.5,Good hotel. The reception staff were brilliant. So helpful and cheerful. Our Queen Room was beside the lift shaft so was really noisy 24 hours a day which was very annoying. Shower room as tiny.
153,Paula,2023-11-12,4.5,"Expensive for what it offers The bedroom is spacious and bright. The toilet has good amenities and lighting. It is good located not too far from the train station. The staff is really friendly and helpful The breakfast is simple and quite depressing. Most of the itens were missing, like pastries and fruits. There were no charcuteries, the bread was old and poor quality. The coffee was decent though"
154,Kai,2023-11-11,4.5,"Great stay! Friendly reception staff, quick and easy check in Friendly breakfast catering staff members, decent selection for breakfast Good room size Non-smart TV"
155,Val,2023-11-09,4.0,Comfortable hotel but some breakfast chaos. The property had big rooms and was clean. There were also two decent chairs to sit and watch the TV etc. The breakfast was okay but the tables were often not cleared for new diners and the food stocks had to be asked to replenished but weren’t.
156,Conrad,2023-11-09,4.0,Very good The breakfast was good No information about the local area in the room and a paper menu in the room would have helped.not everyone has a smart phone to scan barcodes
157,Terence,2023-11-08,4.5,"Convenient and comfortable. A good overnight stop. The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel itself was smart and quite conveniently located for walking to the old town. Breakfast was decent, if unexceptional and the price was good. A good option for an overnight stay in Bristol The hotel could have provided much more helpful information in advance: 1) Access to the hotel by car is complicated (not helped by road works/construction and Google maps thinking you can turn left off Temple Gate where you can't). Last time I stayed in Bristol, the hotel provided detailed driving directions for accessing it from various different directions - something similar would have been helpful. 2) The only information I had from the hotel about parking talked about an option for £20 a day. They omitted to mention the alternative car park 20 seconds walk away that is free overnight, and £2.50 an hour for up to 4 hours. The staff mentioned it, but only when I asked about alternatives if the hotel car park was full."
158,Ruby,2023-11-07,4.5,"Superb Really friendly staff, rooms were really nice with lots of storage Breakfast was unorganised. Me and my partner were sat flipped the ‘occupied’ counter provided with the table to get food only to come back to have to ask a couple to move after they’d been sat at our table by staff."
159,John,2023-11-06,4.0,"Excellent Clean, good staff, good value Coffee machine"
160,Michelle,2023-11-06,4.5,"Pleasant The breakfast was okay, short on cups and cutlery, had to ask for items. I think they need the check in for breakfast nearer the door, it was so busy people was just walking in and not queuing to be seated and helping them selves to breakfast, these could have been people whose not paid as they didn’t give a room number."
161,Andrea,2023-11-06,4.5,Superb Very comfortable Great breakfast included in the price Lovely staff Car park a little pricey
162,Rosie,2023-11-05,4.5,"Superb Convenient location, comfortable room, everyone working there was lovely, and great breakfast."
163,James,2023-11-05,3.5,"Pleasant overnight stay and made our journey easier for travelling to Devon. Breakfast was fine, as well as being located beside historic church building and some old public houses from a few hundred years. A difference in the air between the front and back of building. I thought hotel was not near the train station as we needed to get taxi to and from."
164,Sally,2023-11-05,3.5,Was fit for purpose for a one night stay but wouldn't return if there are other options. Location was handy for the train station. Nice touches in the room like a bath mat all the soaps and gels and fridge. Room was spacious bed was comfortable. It wasn't as modern as would have expected for a Hilton; there was a huge stain on the upholstered desk chair; stains all over the carpets and curtains too. Tea tray was okay but not exciting with no biscuits or fresh milk considering there was a fridge. And I hated having just a QR code for hotel information rather than some paper I could read and keep refer back to. TV half the channels didn't even work and guide was awful.
165,Naomi,2023-11-05,4.5,"Overall an excellent stopover. Staff extremely friendly, all very pleasant. Nice breakfast. Pillows far too soft."
166,Stephen,2023-11-04,4.0,Very good . .
167,Nicholas,2023-11-03,4.0,"Close to the rail station, not far from the cultural centre by the docks, excellent for short stay comfortable clean room, the heating system wasn't working adequately but we were provided with a supplementary heater, very good breakfast Everything was either adequate or good, no comnplaints"
168,Ioannis,2023-11-02,4.5,"Well located. Friendly staff. Nice rooms Well located, very close to the train station. The room was clean and well-sized with comfortable bed. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Nothing in particular. Maybe slightly overpriced but it’s pretty common lately due to the energy crisis."
169,Sivadnaj,2023-10-31,4.0,"Very good but could be even better Very comfortable, no fuss hotel. Helpful staff. Good location for Temple Meads rail station and useful bus connections. Good buffet breakfast. Enjoyed the fitness centre, especially Peloton. The air conditioning was not very responsive. We had to open the small windows to get some air flow and cool the room but then we had traffic noise from the road. The air con fan was too loud to have on for any length of time. Nowhere to hang damp towels to dry."
170,Callum,2023-10-31,4.5,"Central location and hearty breakfast. Great breakfast included in stay, clean good sized rooms. Car parking pricing at £20/night, but good to have the option."
171,Karen,2023-10-31,4.5,Great location for Bristol city centre and attractions Great location for the city centre. Easy access to the station on foot and walking distance from the main Bristol attractions.
172,Kryštof,2023-10-30,4.5,"Superb You get what you expect. Nice and clean hotel with good breakfast and nice staff. Kinda expensive, but worth it."
173,Vant,2023-10-30,3.5,"Not as good as a premiere inn staff were really friendly, no usb in the rooms which were a tad dated"
174,Tony,2023-10-30,3.5,"Good Good location, price, breakfast, clean and bright hotel No functioning air conditioning in very hot room and no alternative rooms available, no parking availability at hotel due to road closure with no prior warning to guests"
175,Joanne,2023-10-29,4.5,Superb Great location and welcoming staff.
176,Joanna,2023-10-27,4.5,"Convenient, clean and friendly Nice clean comfy room and great breakfast. Convenient location and good price."
177,Lee,2023-10-26,4.5,"Great hotel but lacking info on car park access. Nicely appointed room - did not look tired at all. Not too busy at breakfast. Good central location. Car park is visible along the main road, from which there is no entrance. Surrounding road system affords no real time to stop and think how to get into the car park. Clearer instructions with a postcode to the rear of the hotel would help."
178,Vicky,2023-10-25,4.5,Perfect base for exploring Bristol Fab location. Very comfortable room. Excellent choice at the breakfast buffet.
179,Mark,2023-10-25,4.5,I would choose this hotel again for sure. Nice welcome and quality of breakfast. Well thought out room arrangements to squeeze as much as possible into the small space.
180,Joanne,2023-10-25,4.0,"Great location, great staff unfortuantely let down by a disturbed nights sleep. The room was good and the staff were excellent - particularly the staff in the restaurant who were very conscientious with our dietary requirements. Our tv turned on at full volume at 04.29 in the morning. This may have been some preset alarm setup by a previous occupant but clearly not ideal. If this is an option it would be useful to either turn it off or have the staff reset it each time the room is vacated."
181,Brian,2023-10-22,3.5,Good  Parking payment. No free breakfast
182,Nigel,2023-10-21,3.5,Good Handy for the train station and city centre Small room and expensive
183,Titilia,2023-10-20,4.0,"Location was convenient and was clean Location and how clean it was The mattress was uncomfortable, spring bed and not levelled."
184,Giacomo,2023-10-20,3.5,Good Great breakfast
185,Bob,2023-10-20,3.5,"Friendly and Polite staff with an excellent welcome factor. Good size room and excellent facilities, very comfortable bed. Ideal location as I travelled by train and the venue for my function was only 5 minutes walk. Not so good walking back late night through the park opposite as there was a distinctive smell of cannabis, would have taken a different route if known but the times we live in, I guess. I felt that the price was high as the hotel only really compared to other cheaper chain hotels. Yes, the restaurant was better but was only used it for a quick buffet breakfast as I was in Bristol for a function. Speaking with other people met at the function I would look elsewhere if visiting Bristol again as they appeared to get a better deal financially."
186,Dawn,2023-10-18,4.5,"Very enjoyable Good breakfast, nice staff. Good location. We got lost on the way from the train station, on foot, and ended up going the back way round a lot of building works. Then discovered how close it was to the station the next day."
187,Katherine,2023-10-18,4.5,"A very nice place to stay at a reasonable price. Well designed room, clean, nice controllable temperature, comfortable bed, well lit bathroom, very good breakfast, good location. The rooms at the back overlook a park. Nothing really."
188,Pauline,2023-10-16,4.0,"Excellent We found the staff so helpful and friendly. In particular, we had an issue with our booking which Peter resolved beyond our expectations. Location was also excellent. The bed was a bit too firm."
189,Christopher,2023-10-16,4.5,A very enjoyable and comfortable stay. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Car parking at the hotel is a bit expensive.
190,Jennifer,2023-10-15,4.0,Very good Easy to locate near the train station and tourist areas. Very welcoming and knowledgeable reception person. Large comfortable bed. Room good size. Decor pleasing. Large coffee cups. Lift

194,Philip,2023-10-11,4.0,Very pleasant (hope this counts as a sentence). Staff explaining breakfast procedure to me as new Hilton customer. Having a biscuit with the teamaker (!).

196,Katixa,2023-10-09,4.5,"Quiet and comfortable stay Comfortable, quiet, nice bed and desk. Friendly staff. Really close to the railway station. More fresh fruit at the breakfast buffet please!"
197,Mark,2023-10-09,4.0,"Great stay , very poor breakfast though Everything about it was great to be honest, expect the breakfast was very poor The breakfast was very poor quality, the bacon was cold, greasy and rock hard, the mushrooms were dried up, the scrambled egg was all dried up, and sausages were cold, all in all very poor standard"
198,Joe,2023-10-07,4.0,"Necessary Welcome good, comfortable clean room. No biscuits and after a long Fri e could ha e done with one Think overpriced for the one night Pricing not value formoney"
199,Ellen,2023-10-05,4.5,Comfortable stay. Quite central. Easy to reach city centre and Temple Mead Rail Station. Nice Temple Garden to Victoria Street. Love the Clean fresh Bath Towels and Bed very comfortable. Room Brightly lit. Ample Coffee and Tea given in room . Room a bit small. The fridge not working. Shower door cannot close properly.
200,Guillaume,2023-10-02,4.0,"Very good It is a nice hotel in the city centre. Breakfast was good but basic (nothing extravagant, the bread was good though, coffee could be better). We really appreciate the fact that it provide parking possibilities. The staff was friendly and happy to help if needed"

207,Guy,2023-09-24,4.0,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
208,Jan,2023-09-22,4.0,"Very good Room comfortable & excellent breakfast. Also handy for places of interest, shops etc. Tricky to find hotel car park as lots of construction work going on but obviously not fault of hotel."
209,Ana,2023-09-20,4.0,"Very good Super helpful staff. Great breakfast. Perfect location, in between the train station and the city center. Comfortable bed. It's a bit old and outdated, but it's still comfortable. The carpet floors always look a bit dirty, but that's normal in UK."
210,Karys,2023-09-19,4.0,Just right for the purpose of my trip. The room was spacious and comfy and the bathroom was clean and functional (I liked the fact there was a proper shower rather than an over the bath shower). The location was a 2 minute walk from my work venue and the variety at breakfast was reasonable. The staff were excellent. The hotel is in quite a noisy part of Bristol - perhaps some extra sound proofing in rooms would be good as I was woken several times by traffic and other guests just entering/exiting rooms/ the sound of the lift pinging.
211,Lynn,2023-09-19,4.5,Superb Modern clean hotel in business district Cafes and pubs close by A little way out from city centre but bus stop is outside the hotel and the water ferry is a short walk away

214,Ana,2023-09-18,4.5,It was good - too expensive though for one night Pleasant space overall . Hilton chain best beds … Noisy location. Ambulance sirens main dual carriage way .
215,Flo,2023-09-17,4.5,"Comfortable affordable hotel in central bristol Central location, near the train station, comfortable bed and good Buffett breakfast No complaints"
216,Mandy,2023-09-17,4.0,Very good  There was building work very close which closed the road leading to the Hilton car park. Took us 20 minutes to find another way in and had to ask in the end. The hotel need to advise guests in advance of easier ways to access the car park whilst the building continues. In fact the whole of Bristol is a building site.
217,Sascha,2023-09-15,4.5,"Great location for a business trip to Bristol I had a wonderful stay. The room was big enough for one person and everything was very clean. The bed was comfortable and the walls are not as paper-thin as in many other hotels. I enjoyed the breakfast as well. Although the gym was relatively small, all equipment worked and was clean. Nothing really."
218,Dafni14k,2023-09-13,4.0,"Very good The room was very clean, the personnel was very polite and helpful. The location is a great walking distance from the main train station. There was a constant noise in the room and it felt like they were doing constructions from outside, which was not the case. The room temperature couldn't be adjusted so we woke up with a cold. At the entrance, there was a very strong scent/perfume and accelerated our cold :("
219,Barbara,2023-09-11,4.0,Exceptional service from all staff members. Reception staff very helpful at check in and check out. Restaurant staff also give great service. Room rather small but clean and adequate. Room smaller than expected.

222,Etches,2023-09-03,4.0,"Very good Great location for purpose of visit (nearby wedding). Room had a wetroom - brilliant! The seat within the shower are was dirty, in between its slats. I know it's difficult - but cooked breakfast items were cold!"

225,Neil,2023-09-01,4.0,Very good Nice Car park charge
226,Jessica,2023-08-31,3.5,Good How walkable the distance was from the station and softness of bed and cushions Shower went cold quite easily when used late in the morning.
227,Ahu,2023-08-31,4.5,"Very good... Great location, private car park, clean room, delicious breakfast, etc... Staying at Hilton is always a good idea..."
228,Duncan,2023-08-31,4.5,Superb near train and Wetherspoons Knights Temple. Busses handy. staff helpful thanks. no non-slip patch in bath under the shower.
229,Nicola,2023-08-31,4.5,"Friendly staff, great breakfast Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was nice. Cost of parking was a little excessive. Forgot to ensure there was no feather duvets or pillows in the rooms. However, this was soon rectified and we were given a drink as compensation."
230,Ian,2023-08-30,3.5,"Despite the problems accessing the hotel and parking the car, the hotel itself was very good. Staff were very friendly. Very good breakfast. I spent 30 minutes going around in cirlces trying to find the way into the hotel car park to get to reception. In the end I had to drop my wife off to go to the hotel on foot and then make 2 turnings that I was not supposed to make. On arrival it was explained that I should have gone through the archaway marked ""Novotel Car Park Only"". Easier access and plentiful, clear direction signs need to be provided. Parking was difficult due to the limited spaces in the hotel, so I had to park in the council car park and then pay a charge by 8am next morning, until a space became available in the hotel car park (£20 for 24 hours). Not a great system!"
231,Nicola,2023-08-29,4.0,"Good stay Location of hotel is good. The breakfast tables were not cleared quick enough. we were told to find a table and there were not any clean ones, we had to ask for them to be cleared."
232,Ellie,2023-08-29,4.0,"Very enjoyable, would stay again. Clean room, comfy bed, very nice bathroom Would be nice to see some biscuits/ snacks on the tea tray."
233,Ágnes,2023-08-29,4.5,Superb The breakfast was very nice with a good range of options and the receptionist welcoming me was very kind.
234,Siu,2023-08-29,4.0,A good and convenient hotel The location was convenient. The breakfast was good. it would be better if the double room could be providedwuth two chairs instead of one .
235,Mumdooh,2023-08-29,4.5,"fascinating Liked the location, breakfast and staff prompt response. I had an issue relating to Air conditioner in my room at late night, But a big thanks to Sasha from the reception team who instantaneously organized a replacement room and moved me into a new room. Although the hotel has a car park, the spaces seem limited. To me that was a thing but anyone who doesn’t think this as issue wouldn’t be bothered."
236,Thùy,2023-08-29,4.0,"We have a pleasant stay. We will return if the chance arises. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, so it's easy for us to go to the centre of the city. It's rather close to the train station as well. We arrived at Bristol by train, and it took us about 5~7 minutes to walk to the hotel (with our heavy luggage behind). We didn't try the breakfast, but we had dinner at the hotel restaurant. The atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant, and the food is good (we ordered some hot soup, salad, and Buffalo wings). I would like to compliment the ones who cleaned our room for treating my plushie with care. The room is small, but with this affordable price, it's good enough. I have one complaint about the fridge in our room. We weren't sure if the fridge was working or broken, but it wasn't cold enough to store our ice cream and yoghurt. I hope that it will be fixed or improved."
237,Shannon,2023-08-29,3.5,"Good Location was great, 6min walk from the station and tesco express nearby. Room was lovely and the staff made towel swans which was a nice touch. Great value for money and would definitely stay again. The breakfast wasn’t great- sausages and bacon seemed like they had been out for a a while."
238,Rabia,2023-08-28,4.0,Lovely place and great breakfast Lovely breakfast with a large selection of food and even a waffle making machine to make fresh waffles with a range of toppings. Can request eggs how you like them cooked and can request veggie option sausages too for breakfast. Staff was very friendly and very helpful so a BIG THANK YOU! Shower was amazing with lovely soaps and body lotions
239,David,2023-08-27,3.5,A good location and price for my short visit. Location and room were good for my brief visit Some areas of the hotel need improvement but generally good value.
240,Maire,2023-08-27,4.5,"Ideal location for a short break in Bristol. The location of this hotel is ideal, a few minutes walking distance from both Temple Meads Bus/Train Station and the city centre. A very good breakfast is served, with plenty of choices. We were able to leave our luggage at reception on the morning of our departure and collect it that evening as we had a late flight. Nothing."
241,Justin,2023-08-27,4.0,"very pleasant short stay comfortable room, good location"
242,Andrea,2023-08-27,4.5,"Better than expected stay & good value off-weekend The staff at checkin were very friendly, and gave me a room that I asked for facing the garden. Thus my room was nice and quiet, with negligible from traffic noise until after 7am. The bed is comfortable and it's great to have both a kettle and a mini fridge. The included breakfast was very good, with nicely cooked poached eggs to order. The location is very convenient both for the railway station but also lovely walks along the Harbour area. Only tiny things were an annoyance: even when off there is a low hum from the air conditioning and the room could do with more plugs at the bedside for charging phones and other equipment. Finally, it would be nice to have a better assortment of herbal tea bags, such as chamomile and peppermint, rather than predominantly regular tea"
243,Nicole,2023-08-26,4.0,"perfect for a night to stay, if for more days, I would prefer to have a place more quiet great breakfast choices, clean and comfy room location was okay, but the noise of the street/cars were a little anoying"
244,Tess,2023-08-26,4.0,Very good  lack of parking
245,Jamey,2023-08-25,4.5,Great hotel for a city break. The location was a 5 minute walk from the railway station. Pedestrian friendly. Check-in was speedy and efficient. A special mention for Nikita who checked us in and was more then helpful with the choice of room. The hotel was 10minutes walk away form the Old Town. Lots of history and great bars and eateries. So much to choose from. Breakfast was self service and plentiful with a good selection of food. Our room was small but very comfortable. More Tea Bags in the room.
246,Ionut,2023-08-24,4.5,"Outstanding staff, thank you everyone. Owners could invest in some renovations The staff was the best thing about the location. Everyone was so accommodating and friendly. Peter stood out, he’s a manager or boss or something, and he’s leading by example. Also, the food was outstanding. The chicken and rice dish was amazing, don’t remember the name of it. Not to be attributed to the staff, but the hotel could use some renovations. I imagine that’s up to the owners. There’s a particular smell throughout the hallway, but the room was excellent and clean. The furniture is not amazing, as it’s a bit older, but the cleaning staff did their job very well."
247,Graham,2023-08-24,4.0,Value for money Parking is awful. You allow people to park in no parking zones
248,David,2023-08-24,4.0,"Ship-shape and Bristol fashion! This is a modern hotel with everything that you’d expect. The bed was spacious and extremely comfortable, breakfast in the morning had a very good selection, and all of the staff that we interacted with were helpful and friendly, especially Annie(?) at the front desk. A late check-out and storage of bags were offered, rather than asked for. Good city location near Temple Meads, but, that also means you’re close to a busy road."
249,Elaine,2023-08-21,3.5,"Air conditioning in room didn’t work, although we were offered a fan it was very hot and we couldn’t have the window ope Good location for rail link, good breakfast Not close to amenities"
250,Eve,2023-08-21,3.5,Bad management Good breakfast. Clean room with comfy beds. My son was locked in his room after the door failed to open from inside. It took over an hour as we were told we would have to wait for a locksmith to arrive. The staff on reception were useless and most unhelpful given the circumstances as was the hotel manager when we asked for an explanation for how this could happen. He never even apologised! Very disappointing in terms of health and safety..
251,Karen,2023-08-20,4.5,"Superb Very Central, everything In walking distance"
252,Jimmy,2023-08-19,4.5,perfect location for a relaxing quiet city break the room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was good quality but the notable point for me was the friendliness of the staff who were very obliging also there is a nice small park across the road and the hotel is walking distance from temple meads train station where the airport flyer bus stops all good
253,Amie,2023-08-19,4.5,Europe travelling. Great location. Clean and comfortable room.
254,Amira,2023-08-18,4.0,Perfect for a short stay East central location with onsite parking (although you have to pay for it) Small fridge
255,Ruth,2023-08-18,3.5,Good  Xarpet was badly stained in bedroom
256,Albert,2023-08-18,4.5,Just what I wanted It’s location Cost of parking
257,Clive,2023-08-17,4.0,"Good time with young and old. Easy walking distance from the train station, even for my elderly parents. Also, many walkable places to visit. We went to Bath by train for a day out too. The room was a little warm for me and the AC didn't cool it enough."
258,Evans,2023-08-17,4.0,"Excellent Reasonable room with functional bathroom and shower. Position, easy walk into the city centre."
259,Ward,2023-08-17,4.0,Very good N/a N/a
260,Ann,2023-08-15,4.0,"Very good. Breakfast was good thanks. I'm gluten intolerant, the staff were helpful in providing me with toast & cereal which I don't often find in other hotels or bnbs. Not enough decaffeinated tea bags in room. Shower was. Not easy to regulate, either too hot or cold."
261,Rosemary,2023-08-14,3.5,"Good overnight stop for the airport. Good location for Airport Flyer bus from Temple Meads station to airport. Clean room, bed a little hard, very quiet. Dinner limited menu but satisfactory, breakfast good choice but cooked food tepid."
262,Andrew,2023-08-14,4.0,Nice clean hotel would stay again. Good clean hotel good selection for breakfast. Rooms abit small especially the bathroom.
263,Stuart,2023-08-14,4.0,"Very good Nice walk to the centre and river, good breakfast, excellent Sardinian restaurant a short stroll across the square Room not the biggest"
264,Mark,2023-08-13,3.5,"We would stay again Great location, comfortable room. Trying to find the entrance to the carpark was very difficult due to current roadworks, so new temporary signage is desperately required. Breakfast food quality wasn’t great."
265,Joan,2023-08-13,4.0,Good value and comfortable. Very welcoming and helpful staff. Short walk from the station. Although the breakfast was well prepared and presented the quality of the ingredients didn’t match the Hilton of old.
266,Pauline,2023-08-13,3.5,"Convenient for trains and buses, sadly wouldn’t stay again Very clean Chair with broken arms (dangerous) in room Absolutely NO info in room, eg restaurant menu, breakfast times etc Restaurant not busy but we didn’t get our starter! Extortionate price for tiny bottle of tonic water £3.35!"
267,Lorraine,2023-08-13,3.5,Fine.  No complimentary water in the room.
268,Tim,2023-08-09,4.0,"Simply great Friendly staff, although the chef at breakfast came across a little bit annoyed when I made a small and honest mistake like I’m some sort of child. Seems like a nice guy though, but he could have handled that better. The hotel was close to the station which makes it easy to get to another place and back. The location is nice and the price is the best amongst all competition. The breakfast was nice, lots of options, but in my opinion also a bit simple. All in all it’s very much worth your money, I’ve enjoyed it very much staying there. If you are just looking for a nice and easy place to stay, this is a great option. But if you want to make your stay a bit more special, maybe go for another hotel. It’s a little bit of an old hotel, not really modern. Could be charming but you don’t expect it at Hilton’s."
269,Brian,2023-08-08,4.0,"Positive experience and would book again. Bedroom was a good size with comfortable bed.very clean. All the staff were amazing, so friendly and willing to help. Breakfast was good. Only thing I would have preferred is to have a bath as well as a shower."
270,Malika,2023-08-08,4.0,"Returning customer Comfortable rooms, great location. Expensive parking. Restaurant menu limited. Food very average, service rather uneven’"
271,Pauline,2023-08-08,4.0,We felt really comfortable here. It was lovely and clean Nothing
272,David,2023-08-08,4.0,"Good value for money, would stay again Room was good value, staff were very helpful when asked anything, breakfast was ok. Breakfast lacked basic continental products,ie no yoghurt, no butter, only flora margarine, no croissants, Also no tomato with the cooked breakfast,slow to replenish the cooked items, so you were waiting with plate in hand with your breakfast going cold,waiting for items to be replenished"
273,Brenda,2023-08-06,3.5,"Disappointed The room was clean mostly. The toilet didn't flush properly. Took about 3 or 4 flushes each time. Very noisy from road traffic and seagulls. Parking was expensive. Breakfast was all over the place, couldn't find what I wanted right away. By the time I got coffee, my breakfast was cold."
274,Claire,2023-08-06,4.0,"Great location and lovely staff Friendly staff, fridge in room, powerful shower, good location Noise levels from other guests, bathroom too small to dry yourself so had to go into bedroom to do that, too many chairs blocking the room which was fairly small. There was a cracked sink and peeling ceiling in the bathroom. A better variety of tea and coffee making facilities would have been nice for the price. It was very basic and the one teabag I did use tasted like it was very old. The cooked breakfast was not good and the berry juice I had was incredibly sugary. More fresh options would have been better it all felt very cheap on the breakfast front which was a shame as the staff were very nice there"
275,Paul,2023-08-05,4.0,"Nice comfortable stay good choice of food and drinks at breakfast and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was in a good location and was very clean with lovely fluffy towels, toiletries. Even had an ironing board and iron available in the room. trying to find the hotel wasn't easy using satnav."
276,Forence,2023-08-05,4.5,"Superb Breakfast was lovely. Staff at the Recess were very courteous and efficient. Housekeeping staff very hardworking and good at their job. Love the gym, had basic equipments for workouts. Love that they kept clean towels for use during workout and hydration and sanitation stations. We flew into Bristol at 11am and knew check in was 3pm, the hotel was able to keep our bags for us which was nice. But, when we came back at 3pm, the room wasn't ready and we had to wait for more than 30 minutes."
277,Julie,2023-08-04,4.0,"Very good Rooms were nice, good location for shops and train station We had 2 rooms. One room air con was good mother room so hot! But they did bring us a fan which helped hugely"
278,Susan,2023-08-04,4.0,"Really enjoyed our stay a great hotel with lovely staff & excellent facilities we would recommend. Location excellent Quiet when indoors Modern facilities Clean Excellent value Friendly, helpful, polite staff Breakfast was plentiful & good quality, the staff in the dining room were exceptional Room was a little small for 2 mature females who need access especially around wardrobe & desk area. We will request a slightly more spacious room next time."
279,Denise,2023-08-01,4.0,"Beautiful hotel with friendly and helpful staff Beautiful hotel, smart and clean with good parking facilities. Gentleman on reception was amazing and helpful, wish I could remember his name. Went out of his way to help me with my daughter's graduation. One of the rooms I was given was right next to the lift (didn't get this room until after 9pm) and it was not until my younger daughter had got undressed and ready for bed and switched the air conditioning off that I realised you could hear the lift. It did keep me awake most of the night, but as my daughter was asleep I couldn't wake her up to move. I had asked for quiet rooms away from the lifts and stairs (I had two rooms). Also no tomatoes at breakfast, although everything else was good."
280,Mariana,2023-07-31,4.0,"Clean hotel, friendly staff and good location. Good location near Bristol Temple Meads station and clean rooms. Nothing all good."
281,Lily,2023-07-31,3.5,Ok Staff were very helpful and friendly. Our aircon didn’t work we asked but couldn’t be fixed but we didn’t get asked if we wanted to move it was very very hot! I asked for a low room due to a knee injury and this wasn’t taking in I even reminded them on arrival. We were second floor and I had to walk half way down the hallway. There was loose nails/carpet tacks? Not sure what’s they are called between bathroom and bedroom and I cut my feet multiple times. Glasses weren’t clean fridge wasn’t cold.
282,David,2023-07-30,4.0,"Very good, great location and very quiet in the rooms despite being very busy Very clean room And bathroom, the Egyptian cotton towels were exceptionally soft and white. Breakfast was fantastic with a huge selection of food types and the coffee was superb. It’s a very busy hotel so obviously gets a lots of wear and tear. The paintwork And woodwork is starting to show sign a of this but nothing untoward… One thing that does need addressing is the way all the dirty linens and towels Are Left on corridors way after cleaning times and into the evening. Looks Unsightly and is actually a bit of a hazard."
283,Gemma,2023-07-30,4.5,Perfect Everything Couldn’t find so had to call. No food late in evening.
284,Eleonor,2023-07-29,3.5,Good The mirrors and bathroom

286,Cheng,2023-07-26,3.5,Good The room is really clean and the staff are super friendly.
287,Valerie,2023-07-24,3.5,"OK, pleasant enough, but not memorable. Location was handy for the station and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. Breakfast was OK, but a little underwhelming. Generally felt we could have done a bit better at a Premier Inn."
288,Amorelle,2023-07-23,3.5,Bristol stopover Proximity. Lovely staff. When I booked it said I’d been upgraded but that didn’t seem to be the case as room was nice but quite basic. Bathroom small. I paid £159 and on day the cost was much cheaper on booking.com.
289,Anna,2023-07-23,3.5,A very corporate hotel Nothing stood out Nothing stood out
290,Tina,2023-07-23,3.5,Good for 1 night Well equipped. Lovely soft pillows. Good choice at breakfast. They will make your eggs how you like.. I had an incredible omlette! Very strong smell of aftershave scented air freshener in lifts and corrdors etc. Breakfast area very spread out and un-cordinated. Waffle maker not working (but other choices available).
291,Stephanie,2023-07-22,3.5,"Loved the location but hotel very impersonal Location and comfortable Drinks in bar very expensive, food very average"
292,Dominic,2023-07-22,4.0,Great Very pleasant receptionists Fresh coffee at breakfast would be nice the machine coffee was awful
293,Nicholas,2023-07-21,4.0,Great location Location Breakfast poor over cooked
294,Evans,2023-07-20,3.5,"Reasonable, comfortable well positioned hotel. Reasonable room good location and if you manage to get a car parking spot it is helpful and a lot cheaper than most other car parks. You cannot book a car park spot in advance. The Bar area was not great. Lifts got very busy at peak times so we walked to our room."
295,Jennie,2023-07-20,4.5,"Perfect Superb room, very clean and in good condition. Very quiet despite being in the City centre. Very comfy bed with good quality linen and thick towels."

297,Jonathan,2023-07-17,4.0,Very good  I’d prefer a different way to pay for parking. £20 for 24 hours but only parked overnight. Either charge per night or allow partial payment

302,Portia,2023-07-13,4.0,Very good Great location and very clean. Room was a good size and had a lovely view. Bathroom too small and sink was way too close to the shower. There was also no plug socket on one side of the bed.
303,Stephen,2023-07-12,4.5,"Bristol Weekend Location was very good and Hotel facilities very good. Helpful friendly staff. Breakfast seating, had to wait for 15 minutes for table , arrived around 9.30. Staff though were helpful and kept us informed about the table availability."
304,D,2023-07-11,4.0,All good. No Complaints at all. No complaints at all. Perfect for 1 night in Bristol. Thanks.
305,Anita,2023-07-10,3.5,"Basic but decent night's stay Good location. Right by the park and ride stop, which was very convenient and much cheaper and better than paying the onsite parking fee. Breakfast very nice. Staff friendly and helpful. Hotel clean but felt very basic. Twin beds not full size, narrow and uncomfortable. Just a king bed unzipped, which we had to wait for despite booking and checking via unanswered messages. Small and basic bathroom. Small and very basic reception area. I did expect more from a Hilton Hotel, to be honest."
306,Angela,2023-07-09,4.5,"It was a very good stay so frustrating that we were charged twice by the restaurant. It was comfortable, clean and convenient to the station. The restaurant charged our bank account twice for one meal which is frustrating when travelling."
307,Susan,2023-07-07,4.0,Good location and facilities. Convenient location and quiet Long queue to check in and inability to reserve parking space. Plus car covered in tree sap.

309,Im,2023-07-03,3.5,"Good Easy walking distance from Bristol Temple Meads, which was very handy when arriving late at night after a flight from Belfast. Breakfast was pretty solid; it was a rather cold morning, so the porridge was very welcome."
310,Helen,2023-07-03,4.0,Very good Room great size and bathroom very clean. Breakfast was good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. A/C was noisy and couldn't turn it off. The tv didn't work and there were no rooms to move to

312,Anthony,2023-06-30,4.0,"Very nice location and enjoyable stay in Bristol The staff were very helpful. Rooms were clean. Location was quiet. The breakfast was good with a nice selection. It is easy to walk to the city centre & river. Car parking was useful albeit limited spaces & £20:00 fee for 24 hours.. Bristol is a very interesting city to visit. We enjoyed our brief stay. We would recommend this hotel. Due to developments in the area, there are a number of diversions. I found it quite tricky getting to the car park, the SAT NAV kept asking to to turn down NO ENTRY roads ! There are trees that overhang the car park. In the summer these deposit sticky sap - so be be prepared to give your car a good wash when you get home! That is a minor point, not intended to be negative regarding the quality of this hotel."
313,Rupinder,2023-06-26,3.5,"Lovely and what I needed for one night stay Staff were wonderful and I felt safe :) Decor looks a little tired, marks on wall and carpet and air con was very noisy it kept waking me up"
314,Carrie,2023-06-25,4.5,Lovely hotel! Room was comfortable and breakfast was tasty with lots of choice! Great bar and outside seating area over- looking a green park area.

315,Brian,2023-06-25,4.0,"Good location and staff, room not great Reception staff (esp the older chap) This room was supposed to be an upgrade by booking.com but was on par with Travelodge. No USBs in room Room too warm even with a/c lowest temp setting Not enough tea bags or milk No biscuits!"

319,Jillian,2023-06-20,4.5,Really enjoyed our weekend hope to come back one day. easy reach to buses and train station as we came up by train and left the car at home. The dining a bit overpriced and drinks were expensive

338,Ami2,2023-05-29,4.0,"Sure value Kind welcoming, excellent bed, large room (overclassed !), close to the train station. Sense of detail in everything. Air condition command seemed unefficient, so the room was too hot for me ; opening the window was no option considering the noisy street."

342,Anwen,2023-05-28,3.5,"Good location and parking on site. Friendly staff . Anne from reception came out and down the street to direct us to the hotel because road closures meant that the route was blocked, we were really grateful to her for this. parking is expensive.

346,Illia,2023-05-25,4.0,"Good brand-standard hotel A nice hotel from brand, but has not much personality: - Very clean - Sound insulation is good, was quite in room, counting fact that windows were reaching big road - Location is good: very close to train station, kinda border of city center, but Bristol is small, so everything were reachable by foot - Nice park near hotel - Typical english breakfast could be more rich with fruits and vegetables - Food was the same everyday - Room is pretty small only 12 sqm - Asked slippers two times, got second pair only on second attempt"

348,Beatrice,2023-05-24,4.0,"Nice stay in Bristol The location was good and staff members were friendly and helpful.

349,David,2023-05-23,4.5,Great short stay to see a Gig at the Fleece Excellent stay. Nice staff and food very good. Additional cost for parking but I guess that’s standard now.
350,John,2023-05-23,3.5,"Comfortable stay but access not straightforward Room was compact but sufficient for a one night stay. Handy for the city centre and train station. Breakfast was all self-service and plentiful. Difficult to access by car as the postcode/satnav just leaves you on the main road from where the hotel is not accessible. It's necessary to arrive via the backstreets from where it is not signposted and all complicated by building works in the neighbourhood leading to road closures. Only after booking did I receive a message saying that there was limited parking at the hotel on a first come first served basis and that it would cost £20, which wasn't apparent when booking. Stayed on a Sunday night, so fortunately did get a space at the hotel."

All communal areas are updated and nice to be in."

357,Georgia,2023-05-15,3.5,"Good Staff were extremely lovely and dealt with our requests with no complaints. Beds were super comfy, location is pretty good, and the bar in the evening time is a really great space. Our bathroom ceiling was peeling off and our plug was broken, so water didn't filter down the sink. It was manageable because we went out in the daytime and maintenance had sorted it by then but it would've been an even better stay if the plug wasn't broken."
358,Gary,2023-05-14,4.0,Very good Comfortable quiet room Very small ensuite shower room
359,Caroline,2023-05-14,4.0,"Highly recommend this hotel if you need a place to stay near the railway station The staff were lovely. There was good variety at breakfast, including make your own waffles. The room was small but had everything I needed and was very clean. There was no parking on site, as it was full, but the staff directed me to a car park literally opposite the entrance and it worked out cheaper to park there. I liked everything."
360,Michael,2023-05-12,4.5,Superb Location Great breakfast
361,Jason,2023-05-09,3.5,Comfortable & well placed near Temple Meads but make sure you don't get the room next to the gym. Staff really welcoming and helpful. Room and hotel was clean and comfortable. Woken abruptly at 7am by banging/thudding noise that went on intermittently for 20-30min. Turns out it was a guy in the hotel gym directly opposite my room slamming a dumb-bell into the ground.
362,Eleanor,2023-05-06,4.5,"Fresh, Clean, Superb Stay for a Singleton! Room was tidy, clean and quiet. Bed was comfy. Bathroom was clean and bright with nice smelling toiletries and fluffy towels. TV and remote worked and plenty of channels. Coffee bar in bedroom was nice with quiet boiling kettle. Desk and chair were great. Breakfast was lovely--easy instructions to use the waffle maker, which tables were vacant/occupied and where to get drinks. Surrounded by office buildings (quiet on weekends but gave a professional vibe). Could have been more fresh fruit available at breakfast. Elevator chimer bell could have been turned off or on silent during the night (like 23:00-7:00) as rooms near the elevator could hear the elevator bell during those times. Ran out of pastries at breakfast and they weren't replenished quickly."
363,Robert,2023-05-06,4.0,The parking should be free as the price of the stay is getting dearer Breakfast and location
364,Arthur,2023-05-04,4.5,"Superb Excellent location, very close to the train station and walking distance to restaurants, shops, etc Great staff, very friendly and helpful! Excellent breakfast"
365,Slatter,2023-05-04,4.0,"Very good Very clean hotel and smelt beautiful, staff were very helpful Breakfast wasn't cooked quite enough but a nice selection."
366,Raymond,2023-05-04,4.0,"Good hotel but noisy location and poor A/C Clean, modern and tidy. Car parking outside. Nice bar, food and a quiet outdoor verandah to enjoy a drink on rattan sofas. Service was excellent. Too near a busy main road and traffic noise from 4am even with windows shut. Rear rooms are available though. A/C was poor, the controller didn’t work as per the instructions and the fan noise was on and off all night and the room cooled a little but it was stuffy. Uncomfortable sleep. It’s not really near a good choice of restaurants or bars and a taxi is required. The extra service charge added to restaurant service."
367,Paul,2023-05-03,4.0,Very good Excellent breakfast service - location is great for centre of city
368,Amy,2023-05-02,4.0,great location and price location bed a bit hard and not enough pillows
369,Robert,2023-05-02,4.0,"Overnight in Bristol. This is a good business hotel in the developing area of the city towards Temple Meads. We chose the Hilton Garden rather than our usual Hilton Double Tree on the basis of a free breakfast and a room upgrade. The breakfast was fine. I think the room upgrade consisted of a larger bed in a normal sized room, and as a result we found the room and bathroom a bit cramped compared with the Hilton Doubletree which is an older hotel. But overall it was a good place to stay. The outlook from the restaurant, over the Temple Gardens, was particularly pleasant. Our room, at the from of the hotel, faced onto the dual carriageway Temple Way and traffic noise was noticeable at certain times."
370,Helen,2023-05-02,4.5,"Superb Room was very clean, staff were friendly, and professional, breakfast was amazing!!"
371,Lana,2023-05-02,3.5,"Good The hotel is situated very close to the central part of Bristol, it's easy to get anywhere from it. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Parking - we were told we had to pay for a 24-hour stay at the car park, there was even a sign at the reception. However, the parking does not belong to the hotel and we only found out after leaving that we could have paid far less, given that the car didn't even stay there for 12 hours."
372,Paul,2023-05-01,4.0,lovely clean hotel. 5 minute walk to station for airport bus bar
373,Haigh,2023-05-01,4.0,Very good Bedroom ok Cost too high .difficult access to the car park needs sign posting to get into car park

375,Lorraine,2023-04-27,4.0,We travelled in a group of 6 and we all said we would be happy to use this hotel again. Staff were friendly and efficient. The location worked perfectly. The standard of cleanliness was very good. Building work noise ( but no fault of the hotel ) Rather a lack of places to sit that were not In restaurant. The door key cards were hit and miss at working - however staff were always quick to respond.
376,Wen,2023-04-25,4.5,"last minute booking for a weekend stay with good experience breakfast spread are good . and the staff customer service are superb. Parking is charged at 20GBP which is standard for this location/area. despite the new look, i feel the hotel interior are kind old fashion. i,e: no USB charging point near the bed."

381,Jazmin,2023-04-19,4.0,"Good for a night out. Staff were great, lobby was lovely. Good access. There were black marks all up a wall and paint peeling off the ceiling above the shower and a bunch of lights didn't work, but it served its purpose! Parking was annoying."
382,Jazmin,2023-04-19,4.0,"Lovely room, lovely view, dodgy shower. Staff were amazing. Room was bright, beautiful, clean and lovely view of the park. The shower wasn't great. Would just point towards the door even if you tried to move it and got everything wet. Bathroom floor was ice cold."

Breakfast, included in our room rate, was excellent. Fresh and warm croissants and a good hot breakfast buffet with omelettes cooked to order, waffles and cold buffet items also available, plus decent coffee from a machine. Staff were very attentive, friendly and efficient. The property and the room was really clean which is a plus. No dislikes but mattress was a little hard otherwise everything else was comfortable."
388,Julie,2023-04-12,3.5,Great location and friendly staff. The staff were very friendly and the location perfect. Nothing really.
389,Alki,2023-04-11,4.5,Great location with good breakfast great location - close to the train and the city centre everything you need good breakfast the outside of the building seems too 'old' / industrial - but very minor. The inside is fine.

391,Ying,2023-04-10,4.5,Will definitely stay with Hilton again 👍🏻 The breakfast was exceptional! Had a fab wake up coffee and made my own waffles. The room is quiet and I slept through the night comfortably. All staffs are very attentive and friendly.

393,Payal,2023-04-10,3.5,Good amazing afternoon and night staff. Rooms are tired looking but comfortable beds. The breakfast staff absolutely amazing work and cooking done well. It is interesting that the charge for breakfast at the hotel is more around £12.00 and booking.com reflects £10.00. The £10.00 should be applied regardless.
394,Martin,2023-04-10,4.5,"Superb Location, hair conditioner and other hygiene properties in the bathroom, perfect breakfast Missing toilet brush"
395,Amparo,2023-04-10,4.0,"Great hotel. The room was comfy, and all the staff, restaurants, services, etc, too. Everything was almost perfect, but there was one problem. The room door was annoying because it didn't open the door easily. We asked in the reception to change the card door, and they did but still with the same problem."
396,Lloyd,2023-04-10,4.0,"The staff were excellent and accomodating. However, our linen had holes in it, which was concerning. As a whole, the hotel is relatively clean and in an easily accessible location. There was a smell of fish when walking from the ground floor to first floor for most of our stay at the hotel."
397,Daniel,2023-04-09,3.5,couldn’t get parking space . even though we’d paid for it. we did get a refund . the meal wasn’t value for money. lovely the car parking wasn’t great

399,Lindsey,2023-04-09,4.0,"Clean modern and well situated. All good apart from the parking confusion. The location was good. It was a short walk to the river and some of the central spots. Clean and modern room. Friendly staff. Breakfast was a good selection and included in the price. Confusion about the parking. We knew spaces were limited and first-come-first-serve, however my friend arrived first and was reassured that we could park on the yellow hatch marked boxes up against the building if no spaces were available. I arrived and parked in one of those yellow boxes, however when I double checked this at check-in, the staff member I spoke to said this was not allowed due to a recent change of policy. She told me I would have to move the car and gave some poor advice about other local car parks (one of them only allowed 4-hour slots whereas I was staying for 48 hours and the other one required pre-booking and had no availability). I asked why several other cars were parked in the boxes and received a vague answer that they were guests who were checking out, however this was 5.30pm and I also noted that there were at least 2 different cars parked in the yellow boxes at any point during my stay. Ultimately I managed to grab a proper space (quite expensive at £20 per night) but it all made for a frustrating and flustering start to the stay. I should mention that my friend was also told that the disabled bays were fine to use if nothing else was available but I would not have felt comfortable to do that."
400,John,2023-04-09,4.5,"thoroughly enjoyable, would stay again room was lovely, clean and spacious, breakfast was very good, location was a bit out of town location a bit out of town"

402,Pal,2023-04-08,4.0,"Not bad for a few days in Bristol First of all, let me give a shout-out to the extremely helpful hotel personnel who went out of their way to make our stay problem-free. Thank you. Staying on the positive side, the location of the hotel is great, it is located a few minutes from shopping centres, not too far from nice attractions. And Bristol is a very nice city. The room was small and heating was not adequate, so an electric heater was provided which had a tendency to overheat when we used it full on. During early morning I was able to sit in the bar and work, though the wall sockets did not have power."
403,Jason,2023-04-07,4.5,"Excellent Hotel, Amazing Staff The staff were very friendly and courteous and could not do enough for you, from the reception to restaurant to chamber maids, all were amazing. Before we arrived, I asked for an early check-in due to getting to Bristol very early that morning. A note was put on the system. On arrival, no rooms were available, which was very understandable, but we were told to go into the restaurant and grab a coffee or some food while we where waiting , to me, this was a really nice gesture to arriving guests.. Then we were told our room was ready, we were in our room around 11.30/12.00 ... the hotel could do no wrong, the whole hotel is kept very clean and all staff are an absolute credit to the hilton group, If we return to Bristol I know exactly where we will be staying ' The Hilton Garden Inn' Nothing.."

407,Scott,2023-04-03,4.5,Superb We had very friendly service and we really enjoyed the central location which is walking distance to kings street and the nightlife. Booked in advance so the rooms were good value as well. No complaints at all.
408,Tracey,2023-04-02,3.5,Perfect for a meet up as just round the corner from the train station It was the chosen and ideal location for a small group of friends to meet up. There was no warm relaxing area of comfy seating
409,Huskypup,2023-03-26,4.5,"Excellent hotel, location and facilities. Hotel is located set back from a main road, 8 minutes walk from Temple Meads station. Access can be made from front or rear. Restaurant on ground floor. Lifts to all floors. Spacious double room, with shower room. Cupboard with ironing board and iron. Large flat screen TV opposite large double bed, featuring bedside shelves, lamps, reading lights and sockets. Side table/desk with drawers inc. hairdryer, lamp and office style chair. Folding wall mirror above. Floor to ceiling window with opening pane, view only of a close neighbouring building under construction (as of March 2023). Additional comfortable leatherette chair. Double mirrored wardrobe with hangers and drawers, side cupboard containing fridge and safe. Clean kettle and basic tea & coffee above. Shower room with toilet, shelves, sink, and separate shower cubicle. Various towels and soap dispensers provided. Really not much to fault. The bed creaked and banged every time I moved. Lifts could be heard clearly despite my room being some distance from them. The main ceiling light didn't work. One of the desk drawers was broken."
410,Carolynne,2023-03-26,4.5,Superb It is close to town and the station. It has all the facilities that I need. Nothing
411,Ben,2023-03-21,3.5,"OK… not bad, not amazing! I’m a bit of a foodie and whilst the cooked breakfast looked good it was only OK.. eggs were under, sausage and bacon were over.. I appreciate it’s a buffet and it’s hard to get right.. the bread I toasted was actually really good!! The bed creaked loudly from any movement.. I looked under and it was made from MDF sections that were loosely bolted together and without correct tools I couldn’t fix it! Wasn’t a deal breaker… Bathroom was tiny and shower was in poor condition, broken door hinge, cracked tray and blistered paint to ceiling.. All clean and functional, would have been upset if I had paid any more!"

425,Deborah,2023-03-07,3.5,"Good Comfortable and clean room. Nice and friendly receptionists. We drove by car but it was extremely difficult to find the hotel due to road works in the vicinity. A message from the hotel before the day of arrival would have been helpful to advise on the route. When we arrived there was a huge noise coming from the dining room area where people were drinking, and drunk. Perhaps some carpets would help to soften the noise?"
426,Stephanie,2023-03-06,4.5,Superb The great location and friendly and helpful staff.
427,Robert,2023-03-06,4.0,"Fairly standard hotel of its type, can't complain. Comfortable beds, good bar, easy distance to walk into town We suspected the car park would be full, as it is advertised as first come, first served, so we parked out of town. Glad we did, the car park was full and there's not really anywhere local to it that we could see to find a spot."

463,Joseph,2023-01-29,3.5,"Good hotel facilities, rude staff The hotel was what you would expect from a Hilton sunchain. Clean, unspectacular. Good location. Room was a good size and showers were great. I lost my debit card in the week leading up to my stay. Advised by booking.com to update card prior to the stay. The hotel took a payment of about £1 to check the card. I went to check in where we were greated by a member of staff who was somewhat nonplusssed that we were there. In fairness she had checked another couple in just prior. There were other customers at the desk. I was asked for my details. The receptionist, within earshot of my parter and other customers, mentioned that my card was declined earlier in the week, in a tone and demeanour which was not friendly. I explained that I had put a new card on file which the hotel had taken money from. The fact this was said in earshot of others was quite emabarrasing. I checked in. Nipped downstairs shortly after and took a can of soft drink from the fridge in reception. As soon as I took the can out, another member of staff approached me asking if I intended to pay for it. This happened within a split second of me removing said can from the fridge. This leads me to believe that something may have been mentioned re: the declined card, as if I had been profiled. I advised the member of staff that I had intended to pay for this. I put the can in the fridge as I felt embarrased and purchased from the bar instead, from that member of staff, to save any awkwardness in regards to the fridge. I went to reception the next morning having slept on this. A male receptionist was on at this point. I recounted yesterdays issues with him, only to be informed that they always challenge people using the fridge as people assume it is free (it clearly isnt, the price list is visible). He seemed exasperated to even consider dealing with my complaint. There was no apology or anything. I felt as though I was being looked down"

467,Sally,2023-01-20,4.0,handy location for bar on the river good location advertised as parking on site but only after booking does it say first come basis. got the last space when I arrived at 4pm for check in
468,Graham,2023-01-07,3.5,"very good location and good staff, shame about the room and size. The property is in a very good location, with easy access to the city centre and train station. Views over the gardens are good and the location is perfect for a “car free” visit to Bristol. The entrance and fragrance in the reception area is exceptional and the staff were very friendly. The rooms are simply not big enough for the price being demanded, in addition the mattress was very uncomfortable to sleep on and the bed creaked and cracked with every movement on it (a person who weighs less than 80kg) this made for a very disruptive nights sleep. The in room facilities although adequate do not reflect what I would’ve expected from a Hilton brand hotel. The wash/bathroom is tiny with very little room to move in and the shower again was very small."
469,Danielle,2023-01-06,4.0,great value and clean rooms highly recommended staff or manager was so helpful with advise where to visit on our tour of Bristol clean rooms and breakfast was very yummy would highly recommend na
470,Davinia,2023-01-06,3.5,"Good The reception staff were lovely and helpful One of the cleaner ladies was really rude and tried to get into my room even though the door had the ""do not disturb"" sign on. She was aggressively trying to break in, and when I did leave my room- she was then rude to me. One time, she didn't even bother to clean it."
471,Mike,2023-01-05,3.5,Good Convenience
472,Menglong,2023-01-05,3.5,"Good The location was prefect for me as I had come here by train. So it only took me a few minutes to get off the train and reach the hotel. Besides, there is a bus station in front of hotel, which means you can easily get to the city center. Almost everything in the hotel was very good. There was only one thing I didn't like and that was the small size of the room and the small bathroom."
473,Lisa,2022-12-27,4.5,"Great stay Friendly staff, nice comfortable rooms"

476,Thomas,2022-12-19,3.5,"OK but expensive parking (even when empty) and mis-priced breakfast Comfort & location High price parking. High price breakfast, which was increased by £2 over advertised rate, and increased by a further £2 if not pre-booked"

479,Patricia,2022-12-17,4.5,Superb Staff are always helpful and willing to go the extra mile. The location is convenient - close to the town centre but in a quiet spot.
480,Simon,2022-12-17,3.5,"Just a better class of 'basic'. PLUS parking expense! Great location for our stay in Bristol and a very comfortable (and warm thankfully) room. Not much in the way of hotel facilities. The restaurant/bar wasn't somewhere you wanted to spend time. And you pay £16 a night for parking, which isn't made clear in the booking steps. This felt like 'hidden' costs to me. Plus parking, plus breakfast! For a Hilton, it had no luxurious feel to it at all. Just a better class of 'basic'. I wouldn't stay again."
481,Sarah,2022-12-16,3.5,good hotel for a night’s stay. the location was perfect. The staff were lovely and the room was comfortable and very clean. the snack we had in the bar was delicious if a little pricey. my room was freezing even after turning up the heat and the aircon fan sounded like a freight train. even after I switched it off it occasionally started up again. a bottle of water and some tissues in the room would have been appreciated.
482,Kathryn,2022-12-12,4.0,"would come again location, friendly staff, good breakfast problem with heating, resolved with a heater and extra duvet"
483,Claire,2022-12-11,4.0,"Good modern hotel near Temple Meads station The staff were great, so helpful, and helped us to find somewhere to go out for dinner. Room was very modern and comfortable, good bathroom. We had a nice view of the park, and it's super convenient for Temple Meads train station The price was room only and quite high because of that. It's quite a modern hotel, but would be improved by adding some USB charging points, which most modern hotels seem to have these days"
484,Martyn,2022-12-07,3.5,"A pleasant stay Staff welcoming, beds comfortable and room not too warm The soap dispenser in the bathroom was empty. There was no water at all on one of the mornings so could not shower/wash before breakfast."
485,Cheryl,2022-12-05,4.0,Very good The hotel is nice room was very cramped and too small for two people. Offered up grade by email but was refused on the reception desk on arrival infront of other customers very embarrassed bathroom was tiny had to ho in and shut the door to be able to get to the toilet.. no biscuits in the room and only a couple of milks. Clean and breakfast was good

489,John,2022-11-28,4.5,"A comfortable stay in an ideal location. The staff were very helpful, the room was comfortable and the breakfast buffet was very nice. Some of the facilities were a little tired and need of update/replacement. For example, the window catch was broken and the mirror was not properly in its fixture."

492,Kerri,2022-11-20,4.5,"Superb Everything. Lovely welcome, given extra blankets as get cold and amazing breakfast. Only one thing. Mattress was not that comfortable and very creaky when turning over."
493,Emily,2022-11-19,4.0,Very good  the beds were very creaky and the walls very thin - could hear everything next door
494,Bill,2022-11-19,4.5,"A one stay and the hotel delivered in all respects. Staff are superb, helpful and freindly Staff were very helpful during and after my stay. I left an item in the room which they found and communicated to me, then returned. Nothing."
495,Lalitkumar,2022-11-18,4.5,Ideal Stay hotel located in walking distance from Temple Meads Rail Station. Rooms are well appointed. Twin bedded rooms are bigger then Queen bed rooms. Breakfast is nice and good spread. More Veg dishes would be appreciated in breakfast. Bus no 8 stop is right in front of the hotel to go to Clifton Suspension Bridge and near Cabot Circus Departmental Store. Trains to Cardiff and Bath Spa Town are easily available from Temple Meads Rail Station. Thanks to the Reception staff for sending Birthday Cake for my wife to our Room.
496,Elisabeth,2022-11-16,3.5,"Nice, clean hotel. A bit expensive for what you are getting. Room was clean Bed really hard and uncomfortable Not a lot of parking available"
497,Sophie,2022-11-16,4.5,"Superb  I had specifically asked for some gin to be delivered on the 2nd night of our stay (as my friend's special anniversary) but sadly they had put it out on the first night so when we arrived it was already sitting there, very nice, but on the wrong day. I told a member of staff at Reception and he said what would he like me to do and I half-heartedly said 'Another would be nice on the actual day of celebration tomorrow night!' He said fine - which was a mistake as it did not appear the next evening. He should not have agreed without asking his supervisor probably. A beautiful hotel so this was a real shame that this happened."
498,Tanya,2022-11-15,4.5,Will stay there again. Parking available on site. Large clean room. Nice breakfast. Having to pay for parking on site.
499,Jackie,2022-11-11,3.5,"Typical city centre hotel. Close to station. Staff were very good, friendly and helpful throughout, especially as just arrived from Heathrow Garden Hilton, so better in comparison. Breakfast was OK (although surprisingly, not as good as the Heathrow GH). Didn't have dinner but a satisfactory (if expensive) sandwich and the bar was reasonably pleasant. Rooms are a bit small and I didn't find the bed that comfortable (others may have a different experience). The place is looking a bit tired, but not unacceptably so."
500,Ajsidebottom,2022-11-11,4.0,Adequate room for overnight stay with comfortable bed. Avaialbility of bar. Breakfast on site. Comfortable room. Close to Temple Meads railway station - 5 minute walk Close to city centre - 10 minute walk Moderately close to university - 20 minute walk Shower room small Breakfast food a little overcooked Requested quiet room but adjacent to main ring road so traffic noise - muffled.
501,Neya,2022-11-10,4.0,"Enjoyable return visit to this clean, comfortable, hotel supported by friendly and helpful staff. We have stayed there before. Comfortable good-size room. Good restaurant. Pleasant, helpful staff. Mini fridge in room really useful. Wi-Fi was fairly reliable. Bed was comfortable. Would have liked a bath as well as a shower. A couple of maintenance issues in room. Had to ask twice for more toilet rolls. No shampoo in dispenser. Pillows were a bit soft. Cleaner took the wine glasses we brought, but bar staff happily replaced these. Car park expensive at £16 per day."
502,Kerry,2022-11-03,4.0,Very good Staff were great Room was a little small.
503,Christopher,2022-10-31,3.5,"Nice, welcoming and generally clean hotel. Rooms are a little outdated. Lobby was clean, glamorous, and smelled lovely, nice and open and very inviting. The room seemed a little outdated with the decor, that had chips, scratches all over it and also loose hair left in the drawers. I felt like the attention to detail when it came to cleaning was somewhat rushed."
504,Nichola,2022-10-30,4.0,"Ideal place for music venues and temple meades Central location- for Temple Meades Easy to find Walkable Quiet (from outside noise)- even on the main road side! Bathroom good size Toiletries available Iron and ironing board available Tv actually worked (no TV guide though) Bed size was good (two twins together) Needs sockets on both sides of bed Noise- bathrooms, from neighbouring rooms Pillows too soft- feather (personal preference) Size comparable to price, didn’t feel like a good deal"
505,Veronica,2022-10-29,3.5,the proof that great employees will make your stay better the lobby area and the breakfast. But the only thing that made it worth it was the personnel. The girls at the reception were amazing. Super friendly and helpful. The made the difference The bathroon was not clean.

507,Katie,2022-10-29,4.0,"Very convenient and parking was a bonus. Lovely staff and great location Really convenient location and parking too for £16 for 24 hours, which was great for us. The housekeeping staff were super helpful as I asked for extra cups and towels and nothing was too much trouble for them. The breakfast was very good too. A minor and very minor would be to have more fruit options rather than just melon and pineapple, but everything else was excellent."

515,Wendy,2022-10-17,3.5,"Sort out the car parking - just saying it is very limited is not at all helpful! Very helpful staff, hotel was clean, well maintained and comfortable. Ridiculous system with the car parking - not nearly enough car parking spaces - said first come first served but this caused me considerable distress not knowing whether I could access a car parking space and no idea where else I could park because there was no offer of other information or signage. There was more room in the tiny car park to create more spaces but the owner has not bothered to think about the basic needs of its customers. Put me off staying there. I gave it a good as the female receptionist on duty very kindly allowed me to park in an unused disabled car park which I really appreciated her for her initiative for a system that was not her fault."
516,Robert,2022-10-16,4.0,Very good location and cleanliness good choice for breakfast but hot food was cold
517,Sharon,2022-10-16,4.0,Smart hotel and good location Smart hotel. Handy location for the train. Breakfast was a little disappointing as there was no brown bread for toast and the poached egg didn't taste nice.

Whenever I tried to ring reception or room service no one would answer so I ended up having to go down to order, then my order arrived with missing bits. Also I had to sit in the bar for 45 mins as there was a delay with my check in, they told me I was given a free upgrade to apologise but when I got to my room it was tiny and smaller than the one I had originally booked."

Coffee OK."

We rang the hotel, and the receptionist on duty was brilliant at guiding us in by phone and then helping us in the car park. Arrangements for breakfast could have been managed a bit better. For example, I asked for honey. The member of staff returned with two large boxes of the stuff, suggesting it was meant to be on offer but was not. No-one checked me in on either breakfast that I attended. I could have walked in off the street."

My bed was very comfy also. My door was very dodgy. I couldn’t close it properly unless I properly slammed it shut. One night I was worried I couldn’t get into my room because it just wasn’t opening. The bolt just wouldn’t loosen for the door to open. Luckily it did in the end, but I think the bolt needs fixing."
559,Mónica,2022-08-30,4.0,"Very good The location it's great close to Bristol Temple Meads and just short distance to city centre. Good size room. The air con was a bit noise even when not working and was difficult to control and because I was on 5th floor I could hear a constant machine noise that I was not sure was coming from. I would suggest putting a bottle of water in the rooms as well apart from coffee, tea and sugar bags."

574,Andrea,2022-08-10,4.0,"Very pleasant and relaxing. The breakfast was excellent, good variety too. The staff made it for us, efficient,and very helpful and thoughtful. Everywhere very clean. Quiet too. Car parking could have been better."
575,Micah,2022-08-08,3.5,"Ok hotel, don’t expect real Hilton quality. The location was good. It is an ok hotel. Does not live up to the name Hilton. The corridors and other hotel facilities seemed to lack care over the years."
576,Tracey,2022-08-08,4.0,Friendly staff and good value Room was comfortable Breakfast not that great

581,Elizabeth,2022-08-04,4.0,An enjoyable stay with helpful staff Staff very helpful. The cost of parking. Would have preferred a bigger room
582,Christopher,2022-08-04,3.5,"Forget about the breakfast. I would stay here again The hotel is very well located to the city. Being on the main road the room was very quite and had a wonderful sleep, Infact, it was so quite I often over slept. The staff on the front desk we good to chat with but the staff within the breakfast area, well, let not say anything yet Let's take Breakfast. I didn't book breakfast for not sure what hours I'd be working but the rate that Booking.com told me I'd pay on the day was different from what they were going to charge me. Between the hotel and booking.com they got it sorted. Always print things off. The staff in the breakfast area never made contact. Not even a good morning. They were very quick at clearing the tables even if you had food on your plate and gone to get another coffee. When I returned my table and food had been cleared. They were just not interested in the job."
583,Allison,2022-08-03,4.5,"Superb Great location, lovely staff. Has a lovely feel with the gardens along side. Nothing we didn't like."
584,Graham,2022-08-01,4.5,Superb The room was lovely. Breakfast was very good. Found the beds hard. The TV remote was missing did report to reception on departure.
585,Eva,2022-08-01,3.5,"Good Location I didn't like that we were placed in a room by the entrance to the floor, it was very laud, room was for wheelchair users, no shower gel in the room. No bin liners"
586,Bottomley,2022-07-31,4.0,"Overall happy with the price for the service. Clean and appealing rooms, informative staff, parking on site, location was great. Parking £16 a night, electric charging in the car park did not work, room was rather warm and AC was very slow."
587,Keith,2022-07-31,3.5,Good good location and helpful staff and on site parking a bit dated room interiors but very clean
588,Peter,2022-07-29,4.5,"A very enjoyable, relaxing break. Hotel was very nice and our room lovely and bright and comfortable, location was excellent for access to all the main areas of Bristol. Breakfast was very good, and the staff delightful. Maybe the view."
589,Mojisola,2022-07-28,4.5,Superb The male receptionist was very friendly and acted in a professional manner. Answered all questions in a friendly manner. I give him 10/10. The staff in the morning was pleasant also. The sausage and bacon at breakfast was quite dry otherwise breakfast was OK
590,Scott,2022-07-27,4.0,Nice overnight stay Clean and modern

597,Sally,2022-07-20,4.5,"Comfortable, convenient stay. Would definitely stay again It was great to have a twin room option. The beds were really comfortable. Air conditioning was great. Breakfast was lovely with good choices. Staff were responsive to our queries. Ideally located for the main Bristol train station. Lots of storage Bar shut at 11pm. We would have liked a drink when we got back but it shut at 11pm and we didn't see a lot nearby apart from a Wetherspoons. The room was very small but it was fine for us for just one night."
598,Elizabeth,2022-07-20,4.5,Superb Location was good although a lot of building going on in the area so glad we didn't have a car. Room was lovely.
599,Maria,2022-07-20,3.5,Good The room was very bright and nicely structured They need to do some work to become more customer centric.
600,David,2022-07-19,4.5,All we could hope for VERY welll set out shower room but comfortable chairs a bit awkward to use without blocking someting in the space available.. Outlook over adjacent garden and resding in it a HUGE bonus. The meal we enjoyed was conventional but could not be faulted and first rate staff throughout Not much given the site but did not see a 'lounge' area we would have appreciated at other times of year. But did not ssk and may well have one.
601,Nick,2022-07-19,4.0,Very good Good location. Good breakfast. Good air con. Friendly staff.
602,Joanna,2022-07-19,4.5,all the staff were very courteous and obliging. very clean and lovely staff. it was great
603,Elizabeth,2022-07-18,4.5,"Super night away Bar, reception and breakfast staff were outstanding"
604,John,2022-07-18,4.0,"Very relaxing stay within easy walk of town centre. We were on the 5th floor. Even though the room was an the ""road"" side (i.e. not garden view), it was very quiet. This was the weekend of the boat festival - it was actually quite nice NOT to be in the centre of the action - but close enough to walk without problems. The aircon worked well and kept the room cool even when very hot outside. Very comfy pillows. Didn't try the restaurant. Staff helpful - in the absence of a concierge service, the desk staff were able to advise on a good bakery, and an easy way to get to Cathedral Walk. I still think the price was a tad high; we chose it because everywhere else anywhere near the centre was equally expensive - could have gone out of town, but then would have incurred taxi fares."
605,Rachel,2022-07-18,4.0,"Great location with good views and easy walking access to train and bus stations Outstanding location - easy walk from Bristol Temple Meads (easier from the rear exit of the station). Garden facing rooms overlook the Temple avenue of trees, which are very tall and beautiful. Hart's bakery, at the train station, is an easy walk for excellent coffee and pastries. We had breakfast in the churchyard opposite the hotel, on a bench beneat the trees. It was wonderful. Big windows but only one of them opened (and barely at that), and air conditioning that is not as powerful as it needs to be when windows don't open. No hotel stationery (paper or pens). Good selection of teas and coffees, including decaffineated options."
606,Hilary,2022-07-17,4.5,"functional…. staff were very good, helpful, friendly and efficient central room could have been cleaner, water marks on doors and walls from old water leaks?"
607,Nia,2022-07-17,4.0,"Great place to stay, close to the hippodrome. Very clean and had excellent facilities in the room. Staff were very helpful. The mattress was very hard and parking was ok but limited spaces and expensive."
608,Michael,2022-07-15,3.5,"Good staff were friendly at reception and the air con in the room was spot on during this heatwave curtains and walls were dirty and marked but nothing too major , double bed was 2 singles pushed together"
609,Jane,2022-07-15,4.5,"Pleasant stay, comfortable room, hotel staff were really nice I’d asked for a quiet room and was allocated one that was super quiet. The staff were very pleasant and attentive. The room air temperature was just right. The breakfast was good. The beds were comfortable. The only slight drawback about its otherwise good location is that there aren’t any cafes or restaurants really nearby."
610,Andrew,2022-07-14,4.0,"Great - would happily stay there again. Friendly and professional staff. Efficient service. Quick checkout. Room small but well appointed with plenty of storage and a in ironing board and a clean iron (ie not covered in burnt-on residue); an iron and board is so often missing in modern hotels. Great location close to amenities and train station. Cost a little more than I would have wished, but was competitive in the area. My stay was so short that I can't really think of anything that I didn't like other than the bar being shut when I arrived - although a self-service option was available in the foyer."
611,Robert,2022-07-11,4.5,Good work stay good location good food & drink clean and modern accessibility to parking
612,Brimmy,2022-07-11,4.0,Very good Clean and standard rooms. Good customer service in a fantastic location close to Temple meads Station and Bristol city centre. A good all rounder Nothing
613,Victoria,2022-07-10,4.0,"Despite the negatives, I enjoyed my short stay and would recommend. Location was good, within walking distance to the train station and local attractions. Room was perfect size. Staff were welcoming and friendly at all times. I went out into the local area for the morning and came back to a freshly made bed and everything had been restocked in the room. I felt like I was on Four in a Bed doing the room inspections, haha! The room I stayed in had dust lying around (on bed headboard, bedroom sides, areas in the shower room). The shower room was a bit small but that could just be my personal preference. The shower head was dripping despite being turned off. One of the clean hand towels had dirt on. The main light didn't work and neither did one of the plug sockets."
614,Shelly,2022-07-10,4.0,nice stay nice hotel with a modern feel very confusing to get to- the postcode takes you to the front of the building on a duel carriage way and a confusing one way system that you can’t turn down hence you can’t access the Hotel with the postcode
615,Stephen,2022-07-08,4.0,"The noisy extractor fan making sleeping difficult would make me reluctant to return Excellent breakfast. The staff were very good. Noisy extractor fan, not the air-conditioning, which was impossible to turn off which was annoying at night."
616,David,2022-07-08,4.0,Very good Good breakfast
617,Philip,2022-07-07,4.5,"Great hotel in good location A quality hotel which met our expectations. Staff were friendly and efficient, location was just what we wanted and facilities were good. Very happy with it. Car parking at £16 was a quite expensive. Otherwise, it was all good."
618,Rouse,2022-07-07,4.5,"pleasant stay, pleasant and helpful staff. central location, clean, comfortable, helpful staff. well equipped and pleasant room, good breakfast. slightly busy location but not noisy on the park side of the hotel."

621,Dearbhla,2022-07-05,4.0,Very good location
622,John,2022-07-05,4.5,"Now that I know how to access the car park, this is a great place to stay. Very comfortable hotel situated in exactly the right place for our requirements. Finding and getting into the car park was a nightmare. Our satnav took us almost to the hotel but then I had to ask directions. I followed those and as I drove I could see the front of the hotel but with no apparent access for a car. I eventually parked and went into a Novotel hotel to ask for directions. Although the staff were helpful they were unable to give me exact directions. So, I walked around the block to the Hilton Garden Inn where the receptionist explained that I had to drive through an archway, which was clearly marked 'Novotel Hotel', and follow the road to the rear of the Garden Inn Hotel. Quite ridiculous! I could find no mention of this when I re-read everything on my confirmation email. Surely something as fundamental as this should be stated prominently on both booking.com and the hotel website? Also, the hotel charges £16 per day for parking. I don't remember reading that on the website. For any potential guests who might read this review, you should be aware that there are a few spaces in the lane behind the hotel (200 yards from the rear entrance to the hotel) where parking costs are about £5 a day. Not exactly secure but if, like me you object to rip-off parking then this might be an option."
623,Simon,2022-07-01,4.0,"Nice stay, nice location. Location close to the Temple Mead railway station. Breakfast choice was very good and the staff were very professional A view of concrete block of an old multi-storey car park from my hotel room window."
624,Elizabeth,2022-06-30,4.0,"The staff is very gracious and helpful and the breakfast was a good deal and plentiful. The hotel is very conveniently located to the train station, the harbor area and the Cabot Circus shopping area; all within walking distance and a bus stop for the number 8 bus is right outside and goes around the main harbor area and up to Clifton Park and the zoo. This hotel is more convenient to the train station than most but it’s a nice walk along the canal to the harbor and the M Shed area. The room was a bit of a disappointment because it needs a refurb as of May 2022 and the bed was torture but the bathroom looks like it has been redone recently enough to be clean and well equipped and the nicest part is all the shelf space in the bathroom which is rare these days."
625,Alan,2022-06-29,4.5,"Great room, great location and great views Great room, great location nothing"
626,Nicholas,2022-06-27,3.5,"convenient for city centre but beware of a tired interior and rowdy stag/hen parties also convenient for city centre the property requires updating as the interior is very tired and looked shabby also the majority of the guests seemed to be on stag and hen parties bringing a different feel to the hotel, also I resented paying for parking"
627,Laura,2022-06-27,4.5,"Alex is an asset to the Hilton, amazing customer service The location was brilliant, comfy beds, nice breakfast and overall a really lovely hotel At first we were given a room that wasn’t cleaned, this was soon rectified so no harm done"
628,Becky,2022-06-27,4.0,"Good location, comfy bed, friendly staff The room was lovely with comfy bed. I liked having a fridge in the room We went to the restaurant for dinner but found the menu very limited so we actually left and found somewhere else to eat. The shower was also difficult to set as no idea what dial did what"

The room was nice and clean. We were close enough to the train station to travel about. The beds were very hard. Firm is good, but these needed some give. It was like sleeping on a board. Comfortable beds should be a high priority."

645,Patricia,2022-06-14,4.5,It was very good I booked a twin room but had to wait as one wasn't ready so in the end they gave me an upgraded twin room without any extra charge which I was happy with. The location of the hotel was difficult to find as there are many contruction works surrounding it which made it less visible. The breakfast was very good. Nothing.

665,Ole,2022-05-29,4.5,"Wonderfull hotel, we hope to come back soon! A small and clean room with a queen szized bed with a quite comfortable mattress. It was very quiet due to the fact that we had a room next to the street. The bathroom had some good amanities and was also very clean. The breakfast was a typical english breakfast, the staff was very nice. We didn´t booked a breakfast option in advance but that was not a problem. The hotel is located near the center of the town, just a 10 minute walk away. The next station Temple meads is also nearby. In conclusion a nice located hotel, we enjoyed our stax. We hope to come back soon! Overall we had a wonderfull experience at the Hilton Garden Inn so it is quite difficult to find something that was wrong or could be done better. The only thing we recognized was the lacking of fresh salad, but thats what not to expect for a typical english breakfast ;-)"
666,Elena,2022-05-29,4.0,Very good Breakfast was superb. washing machine and dryer are by 24/7 available and working super fine. staff was always very helpful and in general very nice and caring.

668,Adam,2022-05-26,4.0,"Overall - the room was exactly what I needed and the staff were very friendly. No issues at all. Woman who checked me in was very nice, very accommodating, and found me an available room to check into at 11am, despite check in technically being at 3pm. That was great. She also helped with getting the 2nd room key to my friend who was arriving later. She gave me all the necessary details around breakfast etc, Difficult to say the price was great. I originally booked for just myself which was £140 for just me for one night. I then swapped to 2 single beds so my friend could join & the price stayed the same, and I saved money by splitting the cost. Ideally single people shouldn't be penalised for not having a partner, and booking for just 1 person should be cheaper than booking for 2."
669,Ac,2022-05-22,4.0,"Very good Good for the price, quiet area, park view ,Not extremely clean, it was definitely not vacuumed before our stay. The mattress was not the best."

678,Peter,2022-05-15,4.0,"Will definitely go again, but only if a proper disabled room with twin beds is available Very clear (and necessary) directions given to the hotel and the adjoining car park. Superb location for easy walking access to the city centre and docks. Excellent wheelchair access for my wife's wheelchair. The staff at reception and in the restaurant were so helpful, above and beyond expectations. Good atmosphere with the staff. Given thorough instructions for disabled exit in the event of an emergency. Lobby, waiting area, restaurant all on one ground floor level. Beds were very good, we both slept really well, much better than at home. Plenty of eating places to suit all tastes within 10 mins walk of the hotel. We needed twin beds due to my wife's disability. The only disabled rooms with twin beds were not full spec for disabled, so the room was too narrow, and no seat in the shower and insufficient handholds. The full spec disabled rooms only had double beds. I spoke to the manager, who was so helpful, efficient and friendly in all matters, who said he would recommend to your GM to adapt one of these rooms for twin beds. No biscuits in the room! Food in the restaurant was good but not excellent. The scrambled eggs were outstanding one morning and quite awful on the next day. Coffee machine troublesome.."
679,Alice,2022-05-13,3.5,Perfect location and comfy The bed was really comfortable. It is a great location for both the city centre and the train station. The shower was nice but rather small. The curtains were not black out and I'm a rather light sleeper. The duvet was too heavy for the time of year.

688,Clive,2022-05-04,4.5,"Good value and quality business or city centre accommodation. My room was at the back of the hotel making it a quiet without any disturbances in the night. Access to hotel car park challenging due to the road works, with all but one access street closed."
689,Stewart,2022-05-03,3.5,"Surprisingly quiet hotel near the centre My room at the back of the hotel was very quiet with a nice open, green, view - unexpected for the centre of town. Staff were very friendly and the room was faultless if generic. It was a good experience marred only by the absence of camomille tea in the room-set. It would be nice to see at least one non-stimulant tea."

Good location short Uber to everything you need. Rooms are all very modern and both stays we’ve had no complaints with either room both different to eachother. All very clean. Nice area downstairs where you can eat ; drink or just grab a small snack. All staff friendly throughout the stay. Gym downstairs which I didn’t go in but had a peek and it seems alright. Highly recommend Room had a view of a scary looking abandoned car park which was a little unsettling but just kept the curtain closed , didn’t expect much of a view in Bristol city centre anyway"

Lovely and friendly staff members who was working very hard at the hotel. I say a big thank you to all the lovely staff members :) The room was clean and tidy. Thank you so much for the staff members to work hard for this. Sadly the room was cold at night, but we didn’t want to turn the heating on because of it made too much noise. We didn’t have a good sleep. So to make up, we looked forward for the breakfast in the morning(stayed in Hilton in Japan and I thought it was going to be great)but unfortunately, the breakfast quality was poor and we didn’t enjoy."

Staff are always lovely and friendly, plus they are happy to chat. Rooms are starting to need an update - for example no USB ports in sockets for charging devices. Lighting in this particular room (333) seemed to have a mind of it's own - would sometimes work and other times would randomly come on 5-10 mins after the switch was activated."

747,Biddyandbuster,2022-03-19,4.0,"One of the best chain hotels I have stayed in for room facilities, and cleanliness. There was a warm and genuine welcome from Bailey at reception, and we given all the info we needed on breakfast / dining and checkout etc. Reception was filled with the most wonderful fragrance too. The room was immaculately clean, very well laid out with plenty of storage. Having a fridge was a real benefit for milk and cold drinks. Although compact the bathroom had a good sized shower. I was delighted to see that there was magnifying mirror installed, and the heated mirror was a great feature. Breakfast was good and plentiful, but the evening meal was ok but nothing special. Staff throughout were lovely. The only thing that would prevent me from staying again is the fact that the bed was very uncomfortable for me. Too hard and very creaky. It is shame really as everything else was perfect."

763,Rosalind,2022-02-11,4.5,"Our second stay here, and we'll certainly come again. All the staff were really pleasant and helpful. Both breakfast and dinner were good and the dining-room spacious and comfortable. The quick checkout system made our departure easy. The location is great too. The twin room would be more comfortable with an extra chair.; one for each guest. The approach to the hotel was difficult because of building works along Temple Way and it's hard to find the entry to the car-park"

Hot buffet choice was good with quality ingredients but food was totally cold even freshly cooked sausages & beans chef bought out were still cold! Tomatoes & mushrooms were cold, dried up & hard. Very disappointed & never had to complain before about a hotel breakfast but just could not eat it. A refund was handled very well with member of staff on reception. I'm certain this experience was an exception to normal sevice & would not put us off staying again."

801,Roy,2021-12-27,4.0,"Great people. Staff were great. Facilities very nice. Breakfast very ordinary and good very overpriced in my view, paid £16.95 for little more than mini fish and chips.

The shower cubicle did leak and the floor got wet daily because of this. Although I realise the doors have to be fire proof were they there was an awful lot of banging doors throughout our stay."
805,Susan,2021-12-21,4.5,"Really enjoyed it everything about was great The room was very clean and comfy at the back of the hotel overlooking the park, the breakfast was very good they cater for all need. The location of the hotel is good with a bus stop right outside but also not far to walk to centre Nothing I enjoyed it all this is our second visit and will definitely be going back next year it’s the ideal place to stay for us for our needs"
806,Claire,2021-12-19,3.5,"Convenient & electric vehicle charging A very convenient stay, basic bit does what you need. The staff were super helpful & I could charge my car which was very helpful. My room was clean, but the curtains & carpet were badly marked."
807,Ann,2021-12-17,4.0,Very good Location was good. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and quiet. Breakfast would have been better if served onto your plate by one person rather than everybody touching everything.
808,Andrew,2021-12-17,3.5,Good location. Good location and friendly staff. There was a problem with the heating but the staff arranged a portable heater
809,Gary,2021-12-13,4.5,"I had a good time. The location was ideal, half way between the station and town center. One night there was a lot of noise from emergency vehicles through the night, the next night was a lot quieter."

812,Simon,2021-12-10,4.0,A good value utilitarian hotel. Nice that backed into tree lined area. Friendly service and managed to park in car park. Room felt a bit basic. Shower not that brilliant. Only enough tea for one cup each.
813,Sarah,2021-12-06,3.5,Good Comfortable bed Clean room Good breakfast with lots of options No heating in the bathroom Air conditioning wouldn't switch off in bedroom so stayed on through the night and was very noisy Only 1 person on check in - not good when in a hurry

817,Iain,2021-12-06,4.5,"nice hotel, great location, good value great location, good facilities, helpful staff the car parking - too few spaces & the need to move from the overflow car park by 08.00hrs was a bit of a pain"
818,Helen,2021-12-06,4.5,Great Friendly helpful staff breaky great clean room A map beforehand or on initial info on how to get into the place and park ………sat nav as staff stated didn’t have correct info!
819,Tina,2021-12-06,4.0,"A welcomed relaxing Christmas break after a tough 20 months Excellent breakfast and staff were friendly and attentive. The room was on the small side but had a lovely view over the park. Good location for the Christmas market and Carbot Circus - about a 10 minute walk The room was small so a means to hang up coats on the way in would be useful as the wardrobe was difficult to access as it was close to the bed,"
820,Neil,2021-12-06,4.5,"A good trip Central location, clean and comfortable"
821,Christina,2021-12-06,4.0,"busy vibrant city, hotel in good location Very good value for money, very quiet room, really helpful staff Difficult to find due to construction works in city centre and road closures"
822,Valerie,2021-12-06,4.0,"The hotel made our visit to Bristol very enjoyable. Would definitely stay here again. Bed very comfortable. Room not noisy at all during the night which was good as it overlooked the busy main road. Great to have a fridge & hairdryer in room. Breakfast was enjoyable, plenty of choice Location good for city centre Checking in/out process very swift. Peter on Reception went out to buy a paper for my partner on Saturday morning, much appreciated. Thanks to him. Nothing I didn't like, all very good. thank you"
823,Sharon,2021-12-06,4.0,"Very good Hotel was clean rooms were lovely bed really comfortable, staff friendly Bit of cheek to charge as much as they do to park car in their own car park ,then difficulty trying to reverse out , when people are allowed to park along wall where there's no parking bays ,"
824,Jill,2021-12-05,4.0,mini break in excellent hotel within walking distance of main attractions. location and staff breakfast could have been hittr
825,Connie,2021-12-05,4.0,"great trip away for a few nights! the reception staff were great, and the location was ideal! it’s a shame you have to pay separately to park there! the bed was very creaky too"

827,Michael,2021-12-05,4.0,"ok Everything basically OK Because of road works at time of visit, hotel hard to get into. Although staff were helpful & friendly, lack of staff at times made waiting a little annoying."

831,Case,2021-12-01,4.5,Superb The room was a good size.
832,Maarit,2021-12-01,4.5,"Superb The reception and breakfast as well as Recess dinner staff were lovely. The lady (seemed to be the manager) at breakfast was super busy, but still had time to have a little chat with us which was very nice. The breakfast itself was delicious. The selection was nice and the food looked good on display. The reception offered us a bigger room, because we were travelling with a baby. That made us feel seen and understood. Thank you. The Recess dinner menu in our opinion was a bit overpriced. The portions were small. But the food itself was delicious."
833,John,2021-11-29,4.0,"Great trip to the Hilton Nice room, plenty of facilities and the guest service was nice when I asked for new towels. The waiting service was excellent and we both liked the food. Minibar could have been stocked and the TV remote might not have been working properly."
834,Henry,2021-11-29,3.5,"All in, good. Disappointed with the food Room was nice, clean, very happy generally. Good location I was told there was a vegan breakfast, and paid 9.99 for it. However, it was just the sides of others - prefer it if you didn't advertise it as vegan, when it's just mushrooms, tomatoes, beans and greens."
835,Theodorosntagiantis,2021-11-28,4.5,Great stay Already wrote a review on TripAdvisor but yeah 8/10 Heating in room could be working properly

839,Jan,2021-11-24,4.0,"Enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back. The hotel was in a good location, walking distance to the train station and the city centre. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and attentive, especially Leonardo who served behind the bar. We were place on the laundry floor and could hear the machines in the middle of the night."
840,Michael,2021-11-24,4.0,comfortable stay nice and easy access to rooms etc. Very difficult to find the car park due to roads closed nearby. A route map would of been handy.
841,Jackie,2021-11-24,4.0,"Comfortable stay - little overpriced About 15 mins walk from Bristol Hippodrome. Staff great. Room size ok, mini cooler kept water cool, bed firm which I like and pillows comfy. Excellent choice of breakfast and good value at £10 - included full english, pastries, continental, juice, fruit, cereal etc even had a decaf latte!!! Comfortable bar/restaurant. No usb ports in room - bit gutted as I didn't think to take the plug for phone so couldn't charge but in fairness description didn't say it so can't complain really. Comfortable stay but overall a little expensive - 180 for a double room. No info in room on safety procedures, restaurant opening times, bar menu etc."
842,Lorna,2021-11-24,4.0,"£94 for a room was more than I would normally pay but the hotel still made it value for money for good Bristol location location,"

844,Jennifer,2021-11-23,4.5,"Good location for the city , friendly welcoming staff Very helpful and friendly staff . Good location , parking on site . Restaurant on site."
845,Sam,2021-11-22,4.5,Si senor give the ball to Diaz parking right out the front of the hotel. short walk to the city centre I believe I got a good price for the hotel so I got good value for money as the rooms were comfortable and they had orchard pig cider in the bar couple with a bererton Diaz equaliser for rovers I’ll take a point back up north content. Bristol is excellent. nothing
846,Shannon,2021-11-21,4.0,"Very good Receptionist and restaurant staff were very friendly and happy to help. Had a great nights sleep No parking, we had to pay £53 in another car park for 2 nights !! The hotel should offer discount for certain car parks around the city for the people staying at the hotwl"
847,Dina,2021-11-21,4.0,comfortable comfort show room
848,Andrea,2021-11-20,4.5,"pleasant stay, would recommend for a short break to Bristol Clean, comfortable, modern. Good basic facilities bed was squeaky, but not a major issue"
849,Perry,2021-11-20,4.5,Perfect for a short stay Clean and modern All good nothing not to like.
850,Jeff,2021-11-19,3.5,"We liked the hotel itself and all the staff we had dealings with were courteous and very helpful. We did have lunch in t Good location for us. Room clean and comfortable, loved the extra large bed. Double glazing amazing, couldn’t hear a sound from the busy road below, (we were on 4th floor). Large TV was great. Staff friendly and helpful. En suite facilities a little on the small side, but clean and in good condition."
851,Beth,2021-11-18,4.5,"short and very sweet! great and central, exactly what I needed. comfy room, nice staff and a good breakfast I perhaps wouldn’t stay more than a few nights as it’s right on a busy main road … However the rooms are soundproof, so absolutely no issues with sleeping!"
852,Rachel,2021-11-17,4.0,"Good location, rooms a little small The location is good for the station and the town centre. Lifts are very quick! The park opposite is a nice green space. Room was well equipped. Clean facilities and pleasant staff. The shower room is very small but the shower is powerful. The bed was quite firm (not as comfy as a Premier Inn bed!). The hotel is on a very busy road so quite noisy. The receptionist moved us to a room at the back which is quieter. She did this unasked when she saw our age and how long we were staying (4 nights) which was kind."
853,Radosveta,2021-11-17,3.5,"We had a pleasant stay. Overall a comfortable hotel, great location. The room was very clean and the bed comfortable. It was very noisy in the late afternoon/early evening. The entrance to the parking was quite difficult to find."
854,Mcdougall,2021-11-16,4.5,"Great place shame about the breakfast The room, the breakfast and the location were all excellent. I thought that the breakfast were included in the price"
855,Kevin,2021-11-13,4.0,Overall vey good and I would return Room and location. Only thing was that the breakfast buffet had the worst sausages I have ever had in my long life.
856,Ioannis,2021-11-13,4.0,"Very good Clean and cosy hotel with nice breakfast Our fridge wasn't working and although the receptionists knew it, we were not informed and we had to explicitly ask for it to be fixed, once we discovered it. Also, we felt that the staff at the breakfast area were always in a hurry to close before time, as they started cleaning, and taking our dishes at 9.45 and that was a bit stressful."
857,Edward,2021-11-11,4.0,Nice enough Clean room Took a long time to check in. Parking is awful!
858,Afolayan,2021-11-11,3.5,"Was good in general. Good location, I think the carpet in the rooms needs to be changed. Carpet."
859,Allana,2021-11-09,4.5,"great birthday night away and would recommend to others. friendly and well mannered staff, clean hotel and good location to walk into the city centre a little pricey for the car park but I suppose it’s to be expected in a city,"
860,Ann,2021-11-09,4.0,"Very happy with the hotel. Would definitely stay there again. Breakfast was very good value for money. I'm gluten intolerant, staff very kindly arranged gluten free toast every morning. Pointed out what was safe to eat. Room was clean and comfortable. There's a little mini fridge in the room. Really handy . Location is 5 mins from Bristol temple meads train station. Quiet at night. Lovely restaurant & nice choice of food. We felt the room was cold on arrival. We tried to alter the air conditioning, but still blew cold air. Turned it off. Shower was not strong enough, weak water pressure. Apart from that our weekend was really great."
861,Evelyn,2021-11-09,4.5,Restful My stay at the hotel was everything I expected to be and the staff were exceptional - Even though we arrived at 1040 for breakfast on the Saturday the choice and quality was far better than I expected and the experience and friendliness of the catering staff was a exceptional - A good kick start to a very full itinerary on that day. HOWEVER I telephoned a few days prior to the visit to correct an error in the booking and ask a question about parking - After a strange delay in connection my enquiry - which I considered to be perfectly valid - was dealt with in a less than courteous manner and I rang off with the unacceptable feeling of 'Why Did I Bother ? and that same error was present on my booking when I arrived - Yet the very nice lady at the reception corrected it with a smile and no hassle. My actual stay was superb and my colleague was exceedingly pleased as well. See above and in my particular room felt the bathroom was a little cramped but entirely functional - The tightness had obviously been experienced before as the toilet roll holder had received a knock or something before and was loose on the wall. - Plus i would have liked a better hook behind the door for my dressing gown. Plus = Apart from a group of men that were very much into their cups at 3am on the Sunday morning and who decided to discuss when they should meet the next day outside my door {But this was not the fault of the hotel and well beyond their care} - Overall I was very impressed with the quietness in the room and we both slept extremely well
862,Harry,2021-11-08,4.0,Good value. Very clean room. Comfy bed. Common areas and hallways are a little shabby.
863,Angela,2021-11-08,3.5,comfortable stay comfy bed breakfast was a bit cold
864,Stuart,2021-11-07,4.0,above average comfortable clean and convenient with a very good breakfast no where to park as car park was full. spent ages trying to find somewhere
865,Terri,2021-11-06,4.0,"Exceeded my expectations, would stay again! Was very impressed with this hotel. For the price of the room I wasn’t expecting amazing things, however upon arrival I was very surprised. I was immediately greeted with a very clean lobby and friendly reception staff. The room we had was on the top floor which meant a lovely view, the room was very large, clean and well presented. To show that nobody had been in the room after housekeeping, stickers were placed over the doors which I think is a brilliant idea considering covid circumstances ect. There was also a mini fridge in the room which was a delight! Definitely worth the money!! We also tried out the bar and had some food which was delicious. The servers were incredibly polite and everything was priced very fairly for the quality!! The hotel itself is a 5 minute walk from the train station and was in a perfect location!"
866,Christopher,2021-11-06,4.0,A quick getaway it’s location to we’re we wanted to go. The staff. we’re friendly. and welcoming the room was clean and comfortable Amdahl while the gym was small it was well equipped for anyone needing their exercise fix. the only disappointing thing was breakfast on the first morning they appeared to have difficulty keeping up with demand with some items. Unless you were getting your food close to coming out of te kitchen it it cold very quickly.
867,John,2021-11-05,3.5,"Great location, comfy bed, clean facilities. Friendly staff. Breakfast could be improved. Room was fine. Bed was comfortable. Temperature was easy to control. As I was there for work I didn't stay in the room that much. The bathroom was small, but serviceable and clean. Shower was good! Breakfast was average - buffets are a hard thing to get right. The breakfast could have been better. I know hot buffets are never as good as freshly cooked food, but this one was a little on the lukewarm side. It was fine. But it wasn't game-changing. I ate at local cafes the following days."
868,Vanessa,2021-11-04,3.5,"Clean rooms Receptionist upgraded our room for a double bed instead of twin bed at no extra cost There is only one option of parking which is £16 for 24 hours, which I thought was a bit expensive."
869,Uma,2021-11-04,4.0,"Great stay, Lovely reception staff, Clean hotel Room was clean Hotel in a good location as I am an avid walker thus nothing was too far. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel. a Tesco, Pret and Gregs is nearby so didn't have breakfast at the hotel. Room was not cleaned on a daily basis - you had to make a request at reception the night before if you wanted the room cleaned. This was due to maintaining social distancing post CV. I think a sign outside the door should suffice if you didn't want the room to be cleaned. This is not an issue really but wanted to share as a FYI only."
870,John,2021-11-02,4.0,very nice helpful receptionist really enhanced our stay reasonable price and receptionist was very helpful and professional - let us check in early which was really helpful as we were on a short break 3 nights and our time was limited. Also allowed us to store our luggage on the day if checkout rooms a little small but overall was good value for money
871,Holly,2021-11-02,4.0,Very good Very welcoming! Cherry looked after us and showed us interesting places to visit and bars to go that were around Bristol - we had a lovely time! :)
872,Helen,2021-11-02,4.0,great very clean
873,Samantha,2021-11-01,3.5,Good Breakfast was good room comfy For the price of the room expected breakfast to be included also carpark is £16 for 24hrs but you only get the room for 21hrs
874,Jayne,2021-11-01,4.5,"Lovely Hotel in Bristol Very clean hotel, lovely staff great breakfast"
875,Guanyao,2021-10-31,3.5,Good Clean. nice staff nice location Room next to elevator a bit noisy at night
876,Vickers,2021-10-31,3.5,Good Staff friendly and helpful. Good cocktails. Comfy beds. Fridge in rooms a bonus. No hassles. Not too far from the centre but area not too inspiring. A nice little park and ruin next to it though which helped. The hotel is generic but I didn't expect anything else. A decent stay all in all.
877,Helen,2021-10-31,4.5,Sleek and smart beds were large and comfortable modern decor large windows overlooking park swivel chair! parking was stressful approach to hotel with building works was terrible. hotel should provide instructions as at least one road was closed and meant we had to turn round twice to get access.
878,Nichola,2021-10-30,4.0,Very good It was in a good location and close to Temple Meads station. Nothing.
879,Peter,2021-10-30,4.0,Very good Staff were all very helpful and friendly - as I am quite used to with most Hilton properties
880,Andrew,2021-10-29,4.5,"Bristol is a great city, and the hotel met all of our requirements. The hotel is close to the station, and just a 5 or 10 minute walk to the central areas. First impressions are that the hotel is smart, bright, clean and business-like. Staff were welcoming and helpful. Rooms were a decent size and comfortable, self-service breakfasts were of good quality with plenty of choice. The design and decor is conservative, nothing special, but that is purely a matter of personal taste, and I have no criticisms."
881,Russell,2021-10-29,4.5,ideal hotel for our 3 night stay The hotel was central and easy walking distance to docks and shopping centres Nothing
882,Alexis,2021-10-28,4.5,"Superb Room was well equipped bed comfy and was very impressed with the soundproofing. Our room overlooked a busy road and there was absolutely no traffic noise. Very helpful and friendly staff. Ambiance of the bar wasn't very appealing. Also, the drink cans we bought to take to our room were very expensive."
883,Funbi,2021-10-28,4.0,"I had a good stay and staff were very friendly and the room was nice The room was really nice and I liked the view I would have liked to have dinner in my room, but there was no room service"

886,Philippa,2021-10-25,4.0,"Very good Clean, comfortable room. Parking was very difficult as was access due to closed roads etc."
887,Andrew,2021-10-25,3.5,Good value for money hotel. I was given a rear facing room as the hotel was not overly busy.
888,856283839,2021-10-25,4.0,Very good We had an amazing dinner at the hotel restaurant. The staff there was particularly nice and they made us feel very welcome.
889,Nicola,2021-10-24,4.0,"Relaxing and comfortable, in a good location. Great value for money The location was fantastic for getting into the city centre. Staff were friendly and helpful. The shower was always hot, bed very comfortable and the bar/restaurant area was great too."
890,Mark,2021-10-24,4.0,"Enjoyable relaxing stay, would stay again especially considering how wonderful staff. Breakfast very good, good variety of cold or cooked food. Had one evening meal which was again very good, although slightly restricted menu. Staff are brilliant both in the restaurant and on reception, so friendly, chatty and helpful. Great location city centre 20 minute walk, restaurants 10 - 15 minutes. 20 minutes to harbour with historic sites and buzzing cafes, bars and restaurants. The bed - hard, lumpy with very noisy springs, couldn't move without twangs, grinds and clunks,"
891,Raj,2021-10-24,4.5,"Great Staff, Food and Location Staff members were great. Any help you ask for..they were able to help Food - Had dinner and breakfast once. Brilliant food. Location - 10-15 mins walk to all the places - railway station, City Centre, Cabot circus for shopping and near the bus station Room - The room was adapted for guests with disability. so found it difficult for us to move around the room Bed - Bed was little hard / rigid"
892,Grace,2021-10-23,4.5,"Girls night away It was very central to shopping and lots of restaurants and bars only a short walk away. Good location, nice and quiet so got a good nights sleep too. The parking was an issue as the hotel is hard to drive too when you don’t know Bristol well. Maybe instructions should be written clearer."
893,Craig,2021-10-23,4.0,Perfect base for a stay in Bristol. Friendly staff. Very clean. Good location. Friendly and helpful staff No issues to discuss. Very satisfied.
894,Olive,2021-10-22,4.0,"Will stay again Served my last minute need as I forfeited the other place I paid to stay I was safe, staff very helpful. Clean room"
895,Julie,2021-10-22,3.5,Get up really early for breakfast!!! Room was clean and the beds were incredibly comfortable. Breakfast. Queues were really long and items were constantly running out. Poor staff were run ragged. Much better to book a time at reception as in other hotels to manage the flow of traffic and improve customer experience. It is not a cheap hotel after all.
896,John,2021-10-20,4.0,Very good Good and plenty of choice.
897,Iain,2021-10-20,4.5,Great hotel.. Wonderful staff.. It was all good👍 Staff are great and the location is perfect for central Bristol.. I will use this hotel as my regular stay..
898,Andy,2021-10-20,3.5,"OK but for a Hilton Hotel would expect more client service. Room was nice, staff excellent and location is very good. parking is a bit steep when you are a paying guest. Breakfast was cold and you had to do it all of yourself, make your own hot drink, toast and serve yourself so not really value for money and for it to then be cold ? Had better food in a weatherspoon I am afraid."
899,Fifiminkle,2021-10-19,4.5,Bristol trip  Comfy bed. Friendly staff. Good value for money.
900,Rodney,2021-10-18,4.5,"Good location, great value for money, very clean with helpful friendly staff Very good selection of cereal juices and cooked item Staff where very helpful Nothing"
901,Neil,2021-10-18,4.0,Very good Location was good for railway station. Breakfast was ideal with plenty of options. Price for the 3 nights was high but given that the Bristol marathon was on that weekend prices are always inflated because of the demand. Expensive but guess that's what hotels do alas..
902,Brown,2021-10-16,4.0,"Did what was needed. Parking is bad, over charged on parking. Confusing bill payment. Cheaper parking and more parking. Options to have a cold breakfast as an alternative to paying for both hot and cold regardless."
903,Yee,2021-10-15,4.5,Superb Self service laundry. Good for drying clothes in rainy day. Poor sound proofing
904,Christine,2021-10-14,4.5,"Weekend Trip Great location not far from the station and the city centre. Corridor a little noisy at night, otherwise a lovely stay."
905,Paul,2021-10-13,4.0,Very good Breakfast. Room. Staff. Gym. Price. Room size.
906,David,2021-10-13,4.0,"Very good  The address, Temple Way and post code when inputted to a sat nav takes you to the front of the hotel, which has no access by car far from Temple Way. You have to arrive at the back of the hotel to park."
907,Yasmin,2021-10-12,4.5,"Exceptional breakfast and staff Breakfast and staff were exceptional. Fresh waffles and knowledgable, helpful and friendly staff who showed us where to go on a map they provided which tailored to our needs. Couple of minutes walk from the city centre and the harbour. Slightly pricey but it's a hilton. Room a bit on the small side but fine."
908,Jeff,2021-10-12,4.0,"Ideal location, very comfortable, lovely staff Great location in walking distance of the city & harbour area. Bus stops right outside the door. Superb breakfast being replenished constantly so fresh and hot, caters for all. Queen room was very small, but was clean and comfortable. Helpful friendly staff making you feel very welcomed. Queen room was disappointingly quite small, but was clean and comfortable."
909,Esme,2021-10-11,4.5,Superb Nice big comfortable room. Very clean and nice service.
910,Kat,2021-10-10,3.5,"Standard but good value Very clean, friendly service with fast check in and check out. Good value, walking distance to the centre. Hard to find using standard maps! You have to access from the one way systems, which took us a while! The bed was hard, but the room was otherwise very comfortable!"
911,Brian,2021-10-09,4.5,Superb The upbeat and obliging staff The coffee making machine.....it's the first time I have encountered problems with such a device
912,Rachel,2021-10-09,4.0,"Very good The location was perfect for us. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Cherry! The bed was to hard for us."
913,James,2021-10-09,4.0,"Very good Great location in centre of town. Limited parking outside hotel, I got the last space. Parking is expensive. Breakfast was very good and don’t have to checkout till 12. Expensive, parking"

917,Sue,2021-09-30,4.5,"Short break in Bristol Good location about 10 minutes walk from the station and within walking distance of the main attractions, pubs and restaurants. Nice restaurant serving excellent food. Comfortable, quiet and extremely clean room with a nice view of Temple Gardens at the back of the hotel. Small gym but enough for a short break. Friendly, welcoming staff. Nothing."
918,Steve,2021-09-28,4.0,Very good Super location and staff excellent
919,Ranadi,2021-09-28,4.0,Exceptional staff upgraded our overall experience from meh to very good! The housecleaning and reception staff were exceptionally helpful and very friendly. Comfy beds. Handy for the trains and bus links and only a short walk to the city centre Fridge in our room smelt funny Coffee machine was broken and buffet cold meats and cheeses were uncovered so guests were able to cough over it - so we went down the road to Barrista's for a good coffee and light breakfast for the rest of our stay. Seemed pricey for what was offered
920,Enrico,2021-09-27,4.5,"Superb position is walking distance from city center, professional and kind staff nice restaurant with good food and beer using excuse of covid to stop cleaning the room and restoring room supplies (shampoo, showegel, coffee, etc...)"

923,Ayesha,2021-09-22,4.0,"All good Breakfast was great, staff very friendly and helpful, the only downside was the location really as it is a little out of the way from the centre of Bristol but it’s very handy for getting to the train station"
924,Nick,2021-09-20,4.0,"Will be happy to stay here again Decent location, clean facilities and friendly staff. Duty manager who was actually finished for the day, was particularly helpful when I was locked out of my room as the key card got deactivated. Stayed at this chain of hotels before and had hoped for a coffee machine but just had a basic kettle. Friendly staff but check in took ages and not everyone likes chit chat. Just glad I got there before the coach tour party checked in."
925,David,2021-09-20,4.5,"an excelent venue,well situated to accessing the attractions the city of Bristol Breakfast,good selection plus excelent staff. Evening meal ,limited selection but well presented and tasty. Room facilities excelent and comfortable. Staff always cheerfull and very helpful A bit of difficulty accessing hotel because of ongoing traffic development in the area,maybe could have advised customers in advance"
926,Philip,2021-09-20,4.5,convenient and comfortable. Good location. Had air con. Good bar. Helpful staff even later at night. Nothing really.
927,Basharedelbi,2021-09-20,3.5,Good Location Good staff A bit expensive
928,Kathryn,2021-09-19,4.0,Very good Clean and functional I requested a Queen room but was allocated a twin room.
929,Ernie,2021-09-17,4.5,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
930,Jenkins,2021-09-17,4.0,Warm and welcoming Everything Nothing
931,Jia,2021-09-14,3.5,"Very nice and close to centre! Had lots of fun just shame about the fridge cooler Great staff and very clean, and well air conditioned The fridge cooler was not actually cold or working and was the same as room temperature so we couldn't leave any fizzy drinks and leftover take away food inside to keep overnight for next day, although the staff offered kindly to take our stuff for us, we felt little bad to bother them Tuesday morning there was a fire alarm kind of going on and off in the morning but we weren't told about a ""check"" because it went off after 5 seconds. Then started again then stopped again"
932,Darksilver,2021-09-13,3.5,Good Clean and comfortable An alarm went off both mornings apparently it could be to do with steam from showers
933,Sam,2021-09-13,4.5,"Superb The blackout curtains, air con. I could have done with an extra duvet"
934,Luke,2021-09-11,4.0,Very good Good Location and Clean. Perfect for the occasion Nothing
935,Linda,2021-09-11,4.0,"Very good The hotel was nice and central, clean and bright with friendly staff We had to pay an extortionate amount for parking which was not very clear when we booked. We did get an email regarding this but after we booked. The parking cost needs to be clearer at time of actual booking. We were lucky to get a space. If the hotel/city had been busier parking would have been an issue."
936,Roman,2021-09-10,4.0,Good food and drink and service .But parking on site was expensive.  Parking expensive.
937,Beverley,2021-09-09,4.0,A enjoyable break that wasn't spoilt by the hotel but only enhanced by it. Location to train station n city centre.and the staff was very accomendating. No issues to report
938,Helen,2021-09-08,4.0,"Very good The location being just out of the main hub of the city and by Temple gardens which was great, and therefore not so busy. The staff were wonderful and friendly. The facilities were great, and everywhere was very clean which was reassuring. The only downside to the stay was the constant white noise buzzing in the room (from the air/heating con I presume - even though I had the system on the off button) which was annoying at night and did not make for a very restful night's sleep. Ear plugs came in handy. But that was the only downside to an otherwise great stay."
939,David,2021-09-07,4.5,"Good hotel for city break or business travel. Nice city centre hotel, good value for money. Nice room, decent breakfast. Easy to walk and get something to eat. Free parking from 6pm till 8am then you need to pay. All in all it is as expected, if not slightly better."
940,Deborah,2021-09-05,4.0,"Great location and friendly staff Breakfast was ok, staff very friendly and helpful Bathroom a little small"
941,Maddie,2021-09-05,4.0,"Clean, safe, good base for exploring Clean rooms Lovely staff on reception who were very helpful with our checkin Well equipped rooms- ample wardrobe space with enough hangers, mini fridge, iron and ironing board."

943,Mariya,2021-09-03,4.0,"Very good The staff at Bristol is absolutely lovely. Friendly, helpful, gracious and really kind. It was impressive. The location was a little tired. Hilton's in general are not great value for money: rooms are way too small given the price."
944,Jodie,2021-09-03,4.5,Superb It was a convenient location close to all amenities - the staff were really welcoming expecially Peter at the reception desk who couldn’t do enough to help us throughout our stay The parking situation - when the car park was full the hotel allowed people to park in unmarked bays meaning at 10am when I came to leave I couldn’t as a work van was blocking me in - this is annoying having paid £32 for two days parking only to be blocked in and the hotel allowing it as they know how much they have taken in parking fees why would they continue to take money and allow people to park there blocking others and Delaying my exit by around 30 mins

947,Lavinia,2021-08-30,4.5,"Pleasant stay at Hilton Garden Inn The room was very spacious, very clean and the staff was very friendly! I'll definitely come back again. The bed was quite uncomfortable, I couldn't sleep at all :("
948,Abigail,2021-08-30,4.0,"Very good The rooms were lovely but I booked a garden view and got a view of the building across the road. Booked a afternoon tea for two, waitress wasn’t overly helpful as it seems it was too much hassle to do the afternoon tea. After we finished and left the restaurant had many phone calls chasing payment but I had already told them what room we were staying in and to put the payment on the room before we sat down in restaurant 🤷‍♀️"
949,Michelle,2021-08-30,3.5,"Good clean, good staff room small, bathroom very small, no bath. no fridge"

951,Michelle,2021-08-28,4.0,Very enjoyable Excellent location. Friendly helpful staff Vegetarian sausages for breakfast
952,Richard,2021-08-27,4.5,Generally high standard throughout. Very high standard of accommodation and general hotel facilities and staffing with especially helpful reception staff Access to the various parking facilities was difficult to negotiate and more information in advance would have been helpful
953,Carolyn,2021-08-26,4.0,"Good location, clean and comfortable Good location being only a short walk from Bristol Temple Meads station. We were going to a gig at the Exchange and it was a short walk from there as well. The hotel is clean and relatively comfortable. We had a snack in the bar which was very good. It had all the things we needed for a weekend. Nothing I didn't like"
954,Stephen,2021-08-25,4.0,Convenient hotel for centre. Clean with friendly staff Location good for the centre of Bristol. Hotel clean and staff friendly. Thought £16 expensive for car parking.
955,Kushlani,2021-08-25,3.5,"Good Central location and was clean. Breakfast was not well organised and seemed bit chaotic at times. Tables were not cleared promptly, no hot water for tea and had to ask. Breakfast was not worth the amount charged."
956,Val,2021-08-24,4.5,"Excellent location, staff and value for money. Everything was fine. Too many requests for feedback!"

959,Geraldine,2021-08-23,4.5,"This was our first visit to Btistol, we thoroughly enjoyed it, lots to see and do. Breakfast was very good lots of choices. The location is also very good. No complaints about stay."
960,Michael,2021-08-23,4.5,Its one of the better value class hotels in Bristol - who need say more Its just a very nice big modern hotel with all creature comforts - it has a few parking spaces which you must pay not a small fee for but if you know the Bristol parking situation you will snap one up at that price quite happily - i stayed twice and parked there twice Nothing negative to report only the car parkign situation which is horrid all over Bristol and no fault of the Hotels at all
961,Andrew,2021-08-23,4.0,Mask wearing The hotel was in a great location and the staff were very welcoming and accommodating. You are informed before your arrival and there are signs in the hotel that customers are expected to wear masks when in the general areas of the hotel. This was not policed however and was particularly concerning in the buffet breakfast area where people were leaning over the food without masks on and with no checks that people had sanitised their hands.
962,Anthony,2021-08-21,4.0,"dry, over heated, probaly not fresh enough . Location great. room - modern and comfortable. breakfast - poor and dried out"

967,Leon,2021-08-17,4.0,"Very good Clean, friendly staff. Nice restaurant Little tricky to find as postcard takes you to a different hotel and the main access road to the hotel was blocked off."
968,Andrew,2021-08-16,4.0,"City break gem Friendly welcoming staff, plentiful breakfast buffet (although not as fresh on Monday morning). Cannot fault the location for all Bristol attractions and Temple Meads station. Like all chain hotels, it is a little sterile and featureless. Also, to have to keep requesting small housekeeping / room items started to become a little tiresome. As we emerge from Covid, please could we investigate reinstating some way of saying “please service my room”."
969,Rumana,2021-08-15,4.0,"It was definitely good! room, location I explained before I need gluten free, dairy free diet. Staff at the breakfast floor were not well prepared for this. I would have liked to see gluten free cereal options."
970,Liam,2021-08-15,3.5,Weekend away Very good location and good staff Found a pair of old dirty knickers in one of the bed side table which was very very grim

977,Minnette,2021-08-09,4.5,Superb The room was a large one Car parking facilities a bit restricted
978,Robert,2021-08-09,4.0,"Great Great location, clean, felt safe Nothing really, odd stains on wall and carpet"
979,Diane,2021-08-09,3.5,"ok for a couple of nights alone but room on the small size for two The room was fine and understand why have to request extra supplies. Check out was easy. Bathroom supplies good. Felt buffet breakfast a bit too much at these times. Would have preferred to be served. Ham was frozen, fruit choice poor. Location was ok, but the parking price was extortionate. Menu lacked interesting things, very basic but prices very high. Freeview TV lacked many basic channels."
980,Stephen,2021-08-09,4.5,Superb Hotel was perfect for a three night stay in central Bristol. Breakfast was excellent and the overriding positive was the warmth and friendliness of the staff. A well motivated and excellent team of people throughout. Size of room particularly the bathroom. Orange juice at breakfast was a little weak. Otherwise everything else was very good.
981,Michelle,2021-08-08,4.0,Very good Location easy to get about to attractions Some information should be provided about the location of the parking as not easily accessible due to roadworks.
982,Donna,2021-08-07,4.5,"Really convenient, comfy and good value for money Shower was larger than in previous rooms I have stayed in. Very nice Although I had travelled by coach and found it easily from the station my friend travelled by car and found it difficult to access the car park."
983,Ian,2021-08-07,4.5,Superb  Handy for station and town
984,Katie,2021-08-05,4.0,"Comfortable, very clean The bed was very comfy, the cleaning standards were also top notch with partnership with detol. Location was a bit of a walk to the centre about 20 mins, we thought it was closer but our mistake. I must admit, it did seem quite standard for a hotel. It reminded me of just a brand new premier inn, there were no “luxuries” with the stay."
985,Jenny,2021-08-03,3.5,Good Comfortable clean bedroom and en suite and reasonable breakfast with lovely coffee
986,Theresa,2021-08-01,4.0,Great hotel Location..cleans rooms and good breakfast
987,Shaun,2021-08-01,3.5,"Parking  Parking, getting into the car park was extremely difficult with all the work that was going on around the hotel. A more detailed explanation on the web site on how to”get there” would have helped !"

991,T,2021-07-30,4.0,"Very good The staff , very friendly and helpful . Especially when they have to put up with rude guests. The bed wasn't very comfortable , but it would do for 2 sleeps. The coffee in the room was horrid."

995,Sue,2021-07-26,4.0,"Very comfortable hotel, near the City centre The breakfast was fantastic and staff were friendly…. Great location for discovering what Bristol has to offer Telling us about roadworks around the hotel as we couldn’t get to the car park"
996,Yvonne,2021-07-26,4.5,Lovely stay and handy for train station I stayed here to meet up with my husband. We then drove onto north Cornwall the next day! We had onsite car parking. Hotel about 6 minutes walk to Bristol temple meads train station. Rooms were comfortable and very clean. It overlooks a lovely park that we walked through. Air conditioning was so handy with the weather being so hot.

1002,Caroline,2021-07-17,4.0,Nice hotel and friendly staff The outside area to sit and have a drink was nice. Cot they put in the room was large and bedding included. The car parking charge and that the wrong room type was allocated at first. Had to wait a while to get a new room.
1003,Isham,2021-07-15,4.0,Great location. Lady at front desk gave amazing customer service. Price was expensive just for 1 night. Parking a bit annoying too not being able to book in advance.

1006,Suzanne,2021-07-12,4.5,Superb Room clean and tidy. Lovely breakfast staff excellent Peter on reception was very friendly. We really loved this hotel only one annoying thing which wasn’t the hotels fault. The stay was perfect apart from Saturday night Inconsiderate lads moving from room to room keeping me awake for over 3 hours and we didnt get to sleep till 4am. Shouting and being a complete nuisance.
1007,Chris,2021-07-08,4.5,Superb Peter on reception very helpful and the restaurant manageress very good. hard-working too Rooms a little small for 2

1010,Mabel,2021-07-03,4.5,Comfy stay Buffet breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff. Room was clean. Key card kept needing to be reset at front desk. Got a new keycard midway through the stay which solved the issue

1013,Paul,2021-06-28,4.0,"Would go back, but request room away from lifts Location great. Staff friendly/helpful If I had to add a negative, room was near lifts (elevators) so quite a bit of noise from lift motors."
1014,Gaynor,2021-06-28,4.0,Very good We really enjoyed meeting Paulo who was very friendly and welcoming to us on our first night stay. The extras mount up and I would have preferred to have car parking and breakfast included.
1015,Chuck,2021-06-27,4.5,Superb The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The food was excellent too. The cost for the room is similar to London prices.
1016,Timothy,2021-06-23,4.5,"Overnight stay Good location and felt very COVID safe, staff very polite and made you feel very welcome, explain evacuation procedures due to having my mum who has walking difficult. The breakfast was to a very high standard and again following government guidelines. Parking very limited"
1017,Hannah,2021-06-20,3.5,4* not what it used to be The room and rest of hotel was impeccably clean. The staff were very polite and friendly The gym was great - had the whole place to myself (due to COVID) restrictions. Breakfast was lovely. The Hilton brand used to carry a premium reputation however some of their hotels are not much different now to a stay in a premier inn. The room itself was average. Fairly small with a bathroom that needed TLC (peeling ceiling and generally tired). The air con was also noisy and limp making sleeping on a hot night difficult.
1018,Naomi,2021-06-19,3.5,"Good location, clean and friendly. Clean room, friendly staff, great location. The bed wasn’t very comfortable but we were only staying one night so it wasn’t such a drama."
1019,Sue,2021-06-14,4.0,"Lovely hotel in great position Hotel is in an excellent position a short walk from the river and man attractions. It has the added bonus of on site parking for £16 a day, which runs from the time that you hack in, so we were able to leave the car there after check out while we went out for dine lunch. (Worth noting when you are thinking about the time to arrive) Staff were friendly and helpful, single beds comfortable and a decent size and it’s really nice to stay somewhere that allows you to leave the hectic main City behind after a days site seeing. Loads of great bars and restaurants in walking distance and a quiet tranquil park opposite the hotel. Highly recommended. The air con wasn’t working and even though we reported it, no one came to fix it. It did leave the room a bit uncomfortable at night but not enough to stop us returning another time."
1020,Gregjc,2021-06-11,4.0,"June trip Room clean and in good repair, staff were helpful. Selection of channels and user interface was on tv was very poor"
1021,Marian,2021-06-08,4.5,Post code Easy to walk into town and nice quiet location with excellent staff Finding it! Hotel entrance cannot be located using hotel post code Visitors need to be warned that entrance is in a different post code
1022,Sue,2021-06-06,3.5,"Nice hotel. Excellent staff. Comfy pillows. Hard bed. VERY loud aircon. Staff were VERY good. The bed was really hard, and the Aircon was so loud! I didn’t get any sleep at all due to this and unfortunately I couldn’t turn it off as the room was VERY hot. The shower had mold 🙈"
1023,Richard,2021-06-05,4.0,"Very good Friendly staff greeting on arrival, cleanliness, facilities in room and breakfast Location due to roadwork diversions. Bed was very uncomfortable and creaked badly throughout the night when moving - did not sleep a wink."
1024,Phill,2021-06-04,4.0,"Pleasant stay with a comfy bed We have stayed few times before but this time the breakfast was not good, the cooked breakfast wasnt hot and dried out. This was disappointed as we were looking forward to a good hot breakfast. We did request a quite room but was given room right next to lift so we had to request a room change. The breakfast and no information on how to access your car park as it took us 20 mins driving around trying g to find the way in due to all the building works and road closures."
1025,Paula,2021-06-03,4.0,"Great location - loved Bristol Location was great, central to everything. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend!"

1030,Joana,2021-06-01,4.0,"Best location to coordinate w/ trains (Temple Meads) and not far from the lively Castel Park area. Location to Temple Meads Station and Castle Park/canal. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful at all times. Bar has heated terrace and great outside space to accommodate people in the covid-times. Wine cart is good too. Some noise of the cleaners very early in the morning just outside my room, replenishing of amenities only happened when I asked at reception and quality of TP was below hotel standards."

1034,Violah,2021-05-30,3.5,It was ok Bed was too hard Location is ok though we initially could not find the entrance for the car park due to closed and not sign posted from the main road Breakfast was alright Soft mattress
1035,Joe,2021-05-29,4.5,Superb Staff friendly Are sure if cleaning rooms is viable but there 5 days no cleaning
1036,Gem,2021-05-26,3.75,Weekend at the garden. Clean room. Parking onsite even though this was a little expensive. Reception very busy on arrival and very difficult to hear. Could have got a hotel closer to the city for the same amount. Bed was very noisy.
1037,Andy,2021-05-25,4.5,"Superb The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was large and comfortable. The location was great. Nothing, everything was good."
1038,Patricia,2021-05-24,4.0,Very good Close to the centre. Parking charges.Limited parking spaces.
1039,Izabela,2021-05-23,4.5,"Ideal for a bit of fun, friendly staff and nice food Free welcome prosecco ❤️ the staff were very helpful, we could take the food inside the room so loved the Sunday breakfast in bed 🛏️🍳 The information about bar opening times (24h everyday for residents) was wrong and very disappointing"
1040,Joseph,2021-05-23,3.5,"It was pleasant, and I’ll happily stay there again. Bed was comfy and facilities were good. Nice to have an iron and ironing board (some hotels don’t have them now). My door handle was broken on the Saturday night, luckily it didn’t derail my plans but it was a bit of a pain."
1041,Eleanor,2021-05-22,4.5,Comfortable room with friendly welcoming staff. Excellent choice of food for breakfast. Very convenient location - short walk from Temple Meads station. I would rate the dinner in the restaurant lower than the breakfast.
1042,Aidan,2021-05-22,4.0,"A clean, modern and friendly city centre hotel, good value for money for a business traveller. Very friendly welcome at reception. Room was spacious and comfortable. Bed was comfy and I slept very well. Large TV on the wall. Good free wifi. Nice bathroom with a good shower. Nice freshly cooked breakfast. All very Covid safe but relaxed. Nothing really, it was spot on for a business traveller."

1044,Caterina,2021-05-04,4.0,Very good Lovely room with park view Everything was ok
1045,Malika,2024-04-30,2.0,"I have stayed in this hotel several times, but will probably not return. The location is excellent, but the car park is limited and expensive. There should be reference to a cheaper car park on the other side of the hotel. The breakfast was excellent, but otherwise the food menu is limited, portions are smaller than before and quite expensive. Last orders in the restaurant and for room service is at 9.30 pm and food service closes at 10 pm. For early departures, there are no breakfast options. The restaurant gets over-crowded and busy with groups travelling. Other customers at the hotel must sit and eat in the small bar section with a wide screen mostly on sports (soccer) channels. I had booked a room with king-size bed, fridge, laptop safe and balcony. There are no rooms with balcony and also got a room on the noisy street side, not park side. There was a small safe, but no laptop safe and no fridge. The room cost also included bathrobe and slippers that were not in the room and were not provided by the hotel. The management blamed Booking com and agreed to refund only £20 per night. No refund for not having breakfast upon early departure. The manager of the reception, Peter was rather rude and inattentive. This has happened before, too, when my restaurant meals were charged to my room although I paid for the in the restaurant. That led to a long exchange with the hotel to sort out the overcharges.."
1046,Baldwin,2024-04-29,5.0,Great time Staff were brilliant. We arrived early and were checked in to the room. All were friendly and accommodating

1055,Nataliia,2024-04-18,5.0,"Super enjoyable My stay at the Hilton hotel was great with fancy stuff and nice people. The staff were really kind and helpful, and they made my stay super enjoyable. I think you should stay at the Hilton hotel if you want a cozy and friendly experience. Nothing"

1057,Paine,2024-04-14,2.5,"good location. Poor facilities I slept well. The room and shower were comfortable The internet didn't work when I arrived there. I was told to ring reception on 0, when I checked in, if I had any problems. I rang reception 3 times and no one picked up the phone. I held on at least 2 mins each time."

1060,Mark,2024-04-06,1.0,"Very poor The staff are excellent and tried their best to help. Excellent breakfast and comfortable evening bar. Probably the most uncomfortable bed I've ever tried to sleep in, even after a mattress topper was added I still struggled to get a good night's sleep. Way too hard for me!"
1061,Lisa,2024-04-03,3.0,"Would not come back. Staff fabulous. Room really small, hot and not usual standard I have experienced from Hilton. Terrible nights sleep."
1062,Sarah,2024-04-03,2.5,"Mediocre, did not live up the price. Fair size car park with spaces. Loved the fact it had fridge in the room. Great you provide free nice smelling toiletries. Rooms smaller than similar chain hotels. Rooms seemed dated, zero view out the window, bed was too small. Lacked plugs on both sides of bed for phone/ watch charging. Bathroom as very compact. Sadly breakfast was not as nice to taste or as nice of an experience as other chain hotels. Nit as central in the city as thought. Car park fee was extortionate!"

1067,Madhubanti,2024-03-27,3.0,"May return The staff is very friendly, the Bristol station. The hotel is close to Saint Nicholas market, And a short taxi ride away from Glochester shopping area. Are you the only thing I would give feedback on is that the breakfast didn’t have bread - it ran out by the time I got to it."

1070,Louise,2024-03-25,5.0,"Exceptional We were only staying one night but this hotel was so nice. The staff were friendly, and the room was so nice. Nothing to complain about. Being disabled, we were able to park right outside, and the staff had placed us in a lovely room on the ground floor which was accessible for disabled persons. We didn't use any other facilities other than the room so cannot comment on the restaurant etc, but from what we could see it looked lovely."
1071,Derek,2024-03-24,0.5,"Bar closes far too early and food was expensive and poor Room was ok Breakfast wasn’t great Error on bill causing fraud alert, staff couldn’t explain but when checked out staff explained it was an error. I paid for parking and staff put a note in system to say we would be there for 5 nights but I since been issued a £100 fine for one of the nights. Very poor organization"
1072,Robin,2024-03-22,2.0,"OK but pricey for what was provided. The receptionists were exceptionally helpful and considerate. One of them helped us find our destination within Bristol. Another provided a walking stick when I was limping and arranged for my wife to have fresh milk. The room was small and with very little space to hang clothes. Also, the bedside lights did not work."
1073,Mary,2024-03-21,3.0,"Perfect location, friendly staff - would stay here again. Perfect location, near the train. The staff were all friendly and knowledgeable, helpful. Room was very clean. Very nice desk chair and desk. Only one of the self serve coffee machines was working at breakfast. I'm okay with self serve coffee but it's annoying to make people wait in line to make their own coffee. The coffee & tea supplies in the room were not replenished for my second morning. This was disappointing. The bed was a tad hard but okay. The shower room is looking dated."
1074,Dodden,2024-03-18,1.0,"Very poor Location was good . Bar closed early ,no minibar in the room .carpets where filthy. Furniture was old and full of scratches and holes. Fornthebprice, it was shocking we couldn't turn the heating down. So it was so so hot."
1075,Anita,2024-03-18,3.0,As expected Room was good and majority of staff were helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was sufficient and good value if included in the price at time of booking. The location is excellent especially if exploring further destination by train. There was an issue with the prepaid breakfasts paid via booking.com however did not show on the booking The Hilton had. We were charged again and double for parking - all got sorted out eventually but it took several trips to the reception desk and one member was abrupt - event though the issue was with them.
1076,Patrick,2024-03-14,5.0,I enjoyed my visit. Everything was fine.
1077,Tracy,2024-03-10,3.0,"Adequate. Easy check in, parking, nice staff. Small room, small double bed. No water in room , only left out one towel in bathroom. Very adequate but not good value for Money."
1078,Jennie,2024-03-09,5.0,Lovely hotel and staff Clean and tidy Well maintained Breakfast was amazing Parking was a nightmare
1079,Stanwah,2024-03-07,3.0,Good hotel let down by some minor points Good clean hotel with friendly staff. Location okay not fantastic as there wasnt a great deal in the local area Bed was on wheels so was somewhat noisey Room was cold as air conditioning constantly blew out cold air despite trying to increase the temperature Pillows didnt hold their shape and where somewhat uncomfortable to sleep on
1080,Roger,2024-03-06,0.5,Bad housekeeping Perfectly ok hotel. Well located. Pleasant staff. . BUT woke up to find dried bloodstained linen on bed ( bottom pillow and edge of duvet) which had either not been changed and hidden or laundered bloodstained linen has been used. Either way NOT acceptable. Reception staff very apologetic but housekeeping outsourced. Pursuing complaint through booking.com as they can't issue compensation directly which they would have done with a direct booking.
1081,Hebden,2024-03-04,3.0,"Could be better. Staff were helpful and pleasant. Nice restaurant. Very hard bed. Basic, bland room. Toilet didn't flush fully. Noisy young guests next door causing problems until 3.30am until I confronted them. :("

1083,Ian,2024-03-02,2.5,Passable Was allocated a disabled room A disabled room
1084,Samuel,2024-02-24,2.5,Okay but not worth the money Welcoming staff in the restaurant and at front desk The room had not been cleaned properly on arrival (empty bottles) and I had the worst pizza I have ever seen or eaten from this Hotel
1085,William,2024-02-22,5.0,Exceptional Close to railway station comfortable great breakfast Nothing to dislike
1086,Richard,2024-02-22,2.0,Would not stay again. Reception staff polite and efficient. Good location. Well presented. Difficult to access with very limited car parking. Bed uncomfortable as base not solid. Dreadfull shower as temperature fluctuated from freezing cold to dangerously hot without mixer being touched.
1087,Laura,2024-02-21,2.0,"Overpriced and disappointing The location was central and close to attractions. Easy to reach from the coach and railway stations. Breakfast options were good, as were the timings (until 11am at the weekend, which gives you the chance of a lovely lie-in without missing it!) My room felt dark and cramped - sitting on the loo, the toilet roll holder was poking my arm, and I am of average size! There were stains on the carpets and the TV remote control only worked some of the time. No instructions were given on check-in about breakfast (which was included in my room rate), and when I went down in the morning there were no staff at the breakfast buffet and I had to go and ask at reception, where they weren't particularly polite. Overall, not of the standard I was expecting for £100+ per night."
1088,Andrea,2024-02-20,1.0,"Overrated: the fourth star is there for the Hilton name, not the quality of service  The absolutely filthy state of the Herman Miller chair in the room left me disgusted. The cleaner barged into the room without knocking around 9am."
1089,Claire,2024-02-18,1.5,"Run down hotel, that’s need renovation! The reception staff seemed friendly - the bar and restaurant staff kept asking us to leave feedback with their names so they could get a bonus! The room smelt like sewerage, the drainage is clearly an issue. The air con in the room didn’t work, the sink was cracked and the room was run down… 2 wines cost me £25…"
1090,Mckayla,2024-02-18,1.5,"If you order vegan, it won't be vegan. The room was pretty modern and I was on the ground floor. Staff upon check in were friendly. No tissues behind toilet. No conditioner in shower. Menu states Vegan food supplied but the nightime staff told me that isn't true and they just give everyone non vegan food and don't say anything (I was enquiry about the VE 24hour pizza. This is absolutely disgusting. I have a dairy allergy, I could have died. Sausages and mushrooms at breakfast were undercooked. Absolutely not work the £180 (plus breakfast)."
1091,Isabelle,2024-02-18,3.0,Not worth the dreadful trek through one way streets and imperfect diversions. Clean I location Lack of snacks etc Small bathroom
1092,Manonamission,2024-02-18,2.5,"Corporate room, with onsite parking, and regrettably dreadful breakfast. Good location within a 5-10 min walk of shopping, cultural places, harbourside, and a foodie quarter. Having its own car parking is a huge bonus in busy thriving cities such as Bristol. Sound proofing of the room from the traffic was excellent. In the room, was an empty and working fridge which meant we could chill wine, some proper milk(!), and some fresh nibbles. There was also a safe which was appreciated. Staff were all very pleasant and accommodating. The room was quite 'corporate' and devoid of character. And it felt quite cramped. Coffee/Tea provisions were miserly. Only one towel was in the bathroom though luckily we found another in the wardrobe. Initially we were allocated a twin room despite having booked a king bed, which meant having to traipse back down to reception to have it resolved - which it was. Car parking is quite pricey and feels it's exploiting the fact it is onsite -I guess cheaper alternatives are a short walk away. Biggest disappointment was the cooked breakfast buffet in the morning - undercooked tomatoes (how the?), leathery bacon, anaemic(!) tasteless sausages, rubbery(!) scrambled eggs. It was truly dreadful. I wished I'd chosen continental. (Note - we did find out that you can order eggs any way you want but would have been helpful to know when we entered)."
1093,Alice,2024-02-17,5.0,"Comfortable and convenient - set me up for the days work ahead Excellent location for my work in Bristol - comfortable and convenient, good shower and clean bathroom. Breakfast was lovely with good selection. Really appreciated being able to leave my bag after checking out, and to pick it up after my day's work. The chair for the desk in my room seemed to some water stains on the seat which made it feel a bit shabby compared to the high standard elsewhere."
1094,Klaudia,2024-02-16,5.0,Very friendly and helpful staff Location and great service Nothing
1095,Hannah,2024-02-15,3.0,"Service absolutely amazing but not the best room The staff were absolutely amazing from start to finish, literally couldn’t fault them despite the hotel being busy. The breakfast was great. To be honest the actual room and bathroom looked a bit tired and dated. For the price I don’t feel it met Hilton’s usual high standard. This was a valentines night away with my partner and I was a bit embarrassed at how underwhelmed he was on entering the room."
1096,Ruth,2024-02-14,5.0,Exceptional Very comfortable beds and super helpful staff Overpriced biscuits and water
1097,Dakota,2024-02-12,1.5,"Great location but poor hotel Location is great here, bus stop directly outside the entrance of hotel, trains station and city centre a few minutes walk. Breakfast had a good selection of food and drinks and was overall quite tasty. Our first room, had a whole in the ceiling and side of arm chairs had been ripped off as well as our aircon not working at all. Our 2nd room - aircon would work by blowing out air however temp control stated ‘failure’ and wold not heat up so we were cold all night. The beds are only a double and ridiculously uncomfortable. The mattress if not firm but rock solid. The pillows although they look fluffy squash down to virtually flat. Very basic and minimalistic room. For the name, I expected more for my money."
1098,Elizabeth,2024-02-10,5.0,"Ideal location for the theatre Excellent location for the train station and the Hippodrome theatre. Nice room,comfy bed and a good breakfast. Staff friendly and helpful."

1100,Angela,2024-02-05,5.0,Good stay in Bristol Good breakfast and evening nibbles in Recess restaurant. Friendly staff. Not a lot of space in the room.
1101,Jeff,2024-02-05,2.5,"Passable Breakfast was excellent Room was very small, not as clean as I would have expected, carpet and curtains dirty. Bed very noisy and therefore uncomfortable as the wooden base creaked every time you moved."
1102,Shannon,2024-02-04,2.5,Not worth the money Close to the Center Small bathroom that was damaged in several places. The surrounding area to the hotel was a building site.
1103,John,2024-02-04,3.0,"Pleasant  Shower was not working properly, the temperature control was not working properly, either to hot or to cold, could not get the right temperature because it was faulty. Only one big towel and 2 small towels in bathroom, 2 big towels were needed."
1104,Stephen,2024-01-29,5.0,Great Location for a weekend in Bristol Fantastic location. Clean comfortable rooms with good shower. Comfortable bed and room was sound proofed. Nothing
1105,David,2024-01-27,2.0,"Poor, Breakfast OK. Room extremely cold. Was offered a different room or a radiator. Rather than change room chose the latter bur was then supplied with a fan heater that was a noisy and crude way of heating that could not be left on for long periods."
1106,David,2024-01-14,2.5,"Good location, but hotel room only just adequate and in need of refurbishment. Good location, easy access from railway station and easy walk into city centre, friendly reception and restaurant staff. Room was tired, carpet stained, missing paint on skirting board in bedroom. Whilst room was reasonably sized, there was very little space between the bed and the wall on one side yet other side of bed was a large open space."
1107,Amir,2024-01-14,2.5,"Tired rooms and bit average. Great location, handy for the station and town. Very basic, tired looking rooms. Main light in the room didn’t work, was only one towel in the bathroom, and a very stained chair in the room. Parking was also £20 where advertised as £16."
1108,James,2024-01-14,1.0,"Wouldn’t recommend  Overpriced for what it is, room wasn’t very clean"
1109,Alison,2024-01-13,3.0,Fine but nothing special Clean Friendly Staff Rooms were very small and basic. No biscuits on the tea tray was disappointingly stingy. Shower seal was coming off
1110,Suzanne,2024-01-12,5.0,Excellent hotel. Wouldn’t stay again because of parking Good position for town centre. Clean rooms. Good breakfast Parking! Had to pay £10 in nearby car park as the 20 odd spaces in hotel were full of builders working nearby. So had to wait until they finished before parking for £20 overnight in hotel car park. The receptionist told me they let them park as they make money from them! Surely customers come first!
1111,Anwen,2024-01-07,3.0,"You get what you pay for Location Room wasn't as clean as I'd like, but worn and dated. Apple juice at breakfast was fermented and mouldy"

1115,Kelly,2024-01-02,3.0,"It was a nice hotel but not worth the price. Clean room and easy location to where we needed to be. The breakfast was nice in the morning and the front desk staff were helpful as our dinner booking was cancelled by the hotel. The room was very small for a queen room and the price. Parking I would expect to be better for the £20 you have to pay it’s just Right by a main road with no security? We had a squeaky bed and a fousty smell wafting through the room which we think was from the air vents. The room was tiny and nothing amazing in there besides a fridge so I’m unsure what the extra value of the queen room was for. The staff in the bar in the evening barely spoke the atmosphere was dyer! No music considering it was NYE, we felt like they didn’t want us there."
1116,Katryna,2023-12-30,2.0,Disappointing I was really disappointed with the room as it was looking out onto a building site
1117,Stephen,2023-12-28,3.0,"Chritmas and Boxing Day City Break. Friendliness and helpfulness of staff. Heating in room did not work however given portable heater in the room which was adequate. TV selection was poor and channel selection software didn't appear to work , very few channels to select which was dissapointing. Bed mattresses also hard which was uncomfortable."
1118,John,2023-12-28,5.0,Excellent As above Finding the Hotel
1119,Tracy,2023-12-26,5.0,"Was perfect, definitely will stay again. Lovely staff, comfy bed, spotlessly clean and delicious breakfast. Nothing"
1120,Amy,2023-12-21,2.5,"Passable Great location, ideally located near the train station and 10/15 minute walk into the center. Rooms decent size and clean. Good selection at breakfast. The hotel has not dealt with my complaint in relation to noise during my stay. We were told a week prior to our stay the restaurant would be closed to a private function. Not an issue as planned to eat in the city but the hotel placed us on floors one and three with no consideration of the noise we would experience from the function until gone midnight both nights. It's a shame as the hotel was perfect for location and somewhere I would like to stay again had they acknowledged our concerns better. It was clean and the bed were comfy, my only concern was the noise from the functions. However I'm reluctant to return due to the poor customer service from the reception staff and management. The hotel had five floors.I think they could have considered putting us higher up to avoid the noise and away from.guests staying for the function as we had a lot of slammed doors and shouting until gone midnight both nights. Also they could have reminders around hotel for guests to be respectful to other guests staying at the hotel. The room also had poor lighting and were quite dark in the bedroom area."
1121,Catherine,2023-12-19,1.0,"I will never come back It was close to the train station I was put in a room on the first floor near the front of the hotel and I could hear people chatting while smoking in front of the hotel like they were in my room. The hotel was very noisy. I was then sent to a room on the 5th floor with a leak in the shower and the heater was broken. The heaters in both rooms were very very noisy, the noise was worse than if a car was in the room and in the new room it did not even work. I had to go to the front desk and they gave me a space heater. No heater in the middle of winter is unacceptable for a room at 200 euros a night. Moreover the remote for the TV did not work. Unfortunately, I cannot add the video here to show what it was like. The pictures on booking and the reality in the hotel are very different. The furniture are old and the carpet is very old."
1122,Christakis,2023-12-17,5.0,"Exceptional Staff (Maria checked us in) were extremely, professional, courteous and accommodating. 10/10"
1123,Ian,2023-12-11,2.5,"Passable  Disappointed that there was no bar or restaurant for either of the nights of our stay due to private functions. Even though we were told about this after we had booked, this is not an acceptable level of service for what we paid."
1124,Ruth,2023-12-10,1.5,Awful  To be told at 9.30am 15 minutes after arriving no bar or restaurant available in the evening was appalling as we like to use the hotel facilities in the evening nor was this highlighted when booking this hotel when we come away we don’t want to sit in a cold lobby I will Not book this hotel again as I took this up with reception and they couldn’t care less. And god forbid that I wanted to pay cash for my drink on 2 occasions to be told no it’s card the staff would only take my cash when I explained to them that I didn’t have a card!
1125,Jamie,2023-12-08,3.0,Pleasant Good location Rainhead shower needed and not hot enough. King bed was just two twin beds pushed together and tv not working.
1126,Deborah,2023-12-06,2.0,So bad that I cancelled a booking for next year. The reception staff were good. Bathroom ok but no stock of loo paper and not replaced until requested. No towels replaced in room. Dirty stained chair. Had to bring my own hangers as not enough for 2 people. Lack of choice of meals on first night due to coach party having buffet. Ended up with a starter. Parking expensive. Drinks in bar restuarant expensive. Setting not very good either. Felt more like a premier inn or travel lodge.
1127,Sarah,2023-12-06,1.0,Wish I had never stayed there Breakfast was good TV was not working properly Carparking was £20 for 24hrs not mentioned anywhere could not buy for 12 A simple order for dinner wrong poor quality Carpet had stains on it Water kept going cold in shower poor pressure Fire Alarm went off at 6.55 for just long enough to wake us up and not able to go back to sleep sign downstairs said fire alarm was the following morning at 11am
1128,Woodward,2023-12-06,3.0,"The hotel was fine but we have been to Bristol on quite a few occasions and have stayed in better . The breakfast was very nice, but the location was a little far out for us. Allow no one used the shower. It was leaking and by the morning the bathroom floor was wet.

1130,Sean,2023-12-06,3.0,Pleasant location next to train station staffing levels were poor with breakfast area looking shabby due to staff not able to keep up with cleaning due to amount of people eating. for a hilton hotel it felt tired inside.
1131,Joshi,2023-12-05,2.0,Disappointing The rooms are tired. The AC makes too much noise and the AC instructions sticker does not match the actual controls. Small room.. Not worth £150 that I paid for a night stay. Excellent staff and breakfast. Comfy bed.
1132,Jack,2023-12-05,1.5,"Poor  Couldn't control the heating in the room (you were supposed to be able to, but it wasn't working in mine), creakiest bed I've ever slept in, had a 'do not disturb' sign on the door that was ignored by housekeeping."

1136,Mrs,2023-12-03,3.0,"Pleasant Some of the staff were professional, but I feel they would benefit from better training, to make the customers feel welcome on they stay. We thought this property was not good value for money. There was only one comfortable seat to relax in in the bar, and that was just inside the door where everyone was going in and out for a smoke. The rooms had no sofa or comfortable chair so all together you couldn't sit and enjoy a drink anywhere. The hair dryer in our room was melted, so I thought unsafe to use. There was no heating in the rooms and no extra blankets, so I was awake most of the night, shivering.."

Staff were not really helpful we arrived very late 11:00 pm and the hotel restaurant was closed, we asked if they could recommend anything they were not helpful. Also I had asked for a quiet and spacious room, they responded by email saying they would facilitate my request however on arrival we were given a horrible room facing the construction site, and first thing in the morning there was a lot of noise, we barely had a decent sleep. We had asked for a late check out and we were told we can only stay extra 30 mins even though the hotel wasn't busy.I was disappointed for the money i paid"

Aircon didn’t work in the room, staff was helpful and got me into another room with working aircon which was more comfortable- but old fashioned dial rather than being able to set the temperature. Noisy near the main road, could do with better sound insulation and bed wasn’t very comfortable or supportive. Just all seemed very old fashioned and not worth the money spent,"

1157,Cath,2023-11-03,1.0,"Hot and stuffy room and unprofessional male receptionist let down an otherwise nice hotel. Clean room, good shower, comfy beds The room was so stuffy and sweltering despite it being cool outside in October and the window only opened a tiny amount. The air conditioning was useless and very noisy - we came home a night early as both were recovering from colds so we were already blocked up. The worse part overall was the reaction of the male grey haired receptionist with glasses. On the morning of our second day we decided to go home early so I went to reception only to hand in the room cards and check out. I wasn't expecting any refund and didn't really want to explain anything and we were so tired we just wanted to get home. After making me wait for a few minutes until he served me (unapologetically) while he did some admin from the previous guest, I pleasantly said I just wanted to check out and handed him the cards. He looked at his screen and said ""but you're staying for 2 nights"" - I explained that we weren't feeling good and that the room had been unbearable hot and stuffy so we had had a bad night and just wanted to go home. he replies ""Well, you'll have to pay for the second night"" without making eye contact staring at his computer. I'd already paid for the stay when I checked in and hadn't even mentioned not paying for the second night. I was so taken aback and foggy headed that I just said ""I've already paid"" and he handed me the card of the manager in case we wanted a refund. I was amazed at his response and in hindsight I wish I had been more on the ball. Rather than saying something like, ""Im sorry to hear that"" / ""maybe we can move you to a cooler room or ""did you try the air conditioning? I came away feeling as if we were treated like we were not worthy to be staying there and were trying something on, not like a valued guest at all. This member of staff needs some customer service refresher training, or perhaps a new job where he isn't dealing with customers."
1158,Navy,2023-11-02,5.0,"Good VFM room in convenient location Good location beside the train station. Professional staff. The carpets, curtains and upholstery were all a little ""tired"". I'm sure a deep clean would fix it. Hard to do when you're kept busy!"
1159,Carl,2023-10-30,5.0,"Great location for train & city centre Breakfast, location, gym, facilities, staff All good except shower control of hot water. Buckets of good pressure hot water but the thermostatic control went from very hot to freezing cold at the slightest touch. Maintenance issue only and did not affect our great stay."
1160,Nigel,2023-10-30,2.5,"Good location but pricey Good location, helpful friendly staff. Rooms were clean. The toiletries supplies were good quality and smelled great. Beds were very comfy. Air con wasn't working in both our rooms. There was building work right opposite and they were very noisy from 7am on a Sunday morning. We weren't told about this in advance. Shower was leaking. Rooms were very dated. For some reason a tiny room had two large chairs in it that were just getting in the way."

I have been returning to this hotel for the repeat work I have as they were so helpful every time I have stayed.
1167,Michael,2023-10-20,2.5,The hotel served the purpose in that it was central. However we felt it was overpriced and in need of updating The location and the breakfast. The staff were friendly and helpful The room and corridors looked tired and shabby. Our room was very small with the bathroom like a caravan size bathroom. The curtains and carpets had stains. No bottled water in the room which we feel should be standard when you are paying the rate we did
1168,Leslie,2023-10-18,3.0,It was just Okay. Restaurant and staff were excellent Room had many problems which we addressed to reception. They apologized and offered us a discount on the room. That never happened. We were still charged the full amount that we were quoted. No refund ever issued back to our credit card as promised.

1173,Andrew,2023-10-10,1.0,Overpriced and unsatisfactory best thing about the stay was leaving after checkout. Breakfast! The hotel was surrounded by road closures and a building site.

1198,Isabelle,2023-09-16,2.5,"Passable Friendly staff 1)Being charged £20 for parking. The initial email received a few minutes after booking said £16, I contacted the hotel to ask about blue badge parking because my friend has mobility issues. Was told they have 3 but it is on a first come first served basis. (and incidently, those three spaces are quite far from the entrance/reception area - far from ideal. ) 2) Difficult to find. The hotel is easy to see from Temple Way, but finding the entrance to the car park/hotel entrance was difficult. It is poorly signposted and a bit of a nightmare. 3) The hotel accommodation is average. We booked a room with a king-size bed and there was very little room to move around the bed, the room felt very small. The room description mentions an ergodynamic chair, which was the only chair in the room and quite uncomfortable.. The furniture hasn't been updated for a while. Bed side sockets could be more accessible. Don't be deceived by the ""Hilton"" name, this feels like an inferior budget hotel, and what you save on the so called free breakfadt in the room description is taken off you in parking fees."

There were splashs of something all over the wall next to the mirror, the quilt cover on one bed was stained and the bathroom fixtures were in disrepair and had rusted to a degree. I expected a better breakfast selection given the star rating of this hotel, and the standard of the cooked items on offer was sub standard at best. I expected better quality for the room rate I paid and I wouldn't recommend the Hilton chain."

The rooms were pretty much the same, I firstly booked the queen room with park view, I was offered an upgrade which seemed good to a king room, when we arrived we were given our room to fines it was a twin double, the reception staff were lovely and changed us to the room I had upgraded to, to find we were overlooking the main road and the only difference I could see was the size of the bed, the t.v had no menu as to what was on which can be annoying."

1214,Dawn,2023-08-29,5.0,Exceptional Staff friendly helpful room really good. Clean tidy I think that the catering team could provide at least 2 vegetables for breakfast so mushrooms and tomatoes not one or the other. Also a list of things on offer so poached eggs vegan sausages etc we had to ask. Prunes would be a welcomed addition to the fresh fruit range. Double checking room to make sure that the room service menu is actually in there.Ours was not.A map of Bristol in the room or on offer at reception would be great as well. And where was the Gideon bible ?????
1215,Richard,2023-08-28,5.0,"Great value for money, convenient for public transport and exceeded my expectations in every way. I was pleasantly surprised with everything about the hotel. i chose it based on price and location, which was perfect as was using public transport for a week of visiting family and friends. I have travelled a fair bit during the past year and hotel prices have been ludicrously high in most places. Everything, the staff, the comfortable bed, soundproofing from outside noise, breakfast, etc,etc. made my stay really enjoyable at a reasonable price. I was staying alone so maybe the room I had may be small for 2 people, but I would still recommend booking here. No criticism."

1231,Steven,2023-08-17,1.0,Poor no thank you Bristol Hilton The room was comfortable Aircon did not work 1. Parking not told until booking made that parking was £20 a day! I tried to cancel as we had travelled in 2 cars £40 as a guest on room that cost £82. 2. Roadworks were everywhere at the Hotel no message to inform us that all entrances were closed around hotel. Easy to warn customers in advance! 3. At breakfast my partner was rudely approached that we didn’t have breakfast on our booking which was totally incorrect! So I was made to back to room to bring my phone and show proof of the breakfast! Staff should know!! Aircon I’m room was not working at all and when approached next day the staff said we could have got a fan at night. Ut that’s not cool air that’s just blowing warm air around. Overall poor

1240,Kim,2023-08-07,2.0,Ok  Poor access by car
1241,Wojciech,2023-08-05,5.0,"My favourite place to stay in Bristol. Staff was very friendly. They have even changed the room for the one I preferred. Great breakfast and clean room. Earlier check-ins than 3 pm would be advantageous. Also, better breakfast offer for more vegetables."
1242,Marion,2023-08-04,1.5,Poor  The rooms are very out of date and not worth the money
1243,Gam,2023-08-04,5.0,"Had a pleasant stay and would definitely stay there if we visit Bristol again. Located at a very convenient and quite part of the town. Very comfortable room with plenty of space and clean. Very nice restaurant and bar, foods were really good. Breakfast was plentiful and the good thing is that breakfast was laid out in different part ie. main breakfast in one corner, pastries drinks & coffee in other area so it avoided crowding in one place everyone queuing in most of the other hotels. Couple bottles of mineral water in room would have been nice."
1244,Kirsten,2023-08-03,5.0,"Great stay and can recommend Great breakfast, great people at frontdesk and we could check in early Coffe mashine in restaurant"
1245,Duncan,2023-08-03,1.5,"Not great. The young lad behind the bar on Saturday 29th July was very helpful, as was the girl organising the breakfasts on Sunday morning. Apart from the two staff above, we found the staff unhelpful and surly, even being ignored as we checked out on the Sunday."
1246,Jane,2023-08-03,5.0,"Great hotel for the price Staff were friendly. Hotel was smart and clean (and reception area smelt nice). Small room and double bed were comfortable. Limited parking, so best to have a Plan B in case car park is full. Overall, a great hotel for the price."
1247,David,2023-08-02,5.0,Highly recommended hotel. A lovely hotel in an excellent location with very friendly staff and a superb breakfast.
1248,Merete,2023-08-01,5.0,"Exceptional Really good costumer service. Got a late check out without extra costs. Wonderful breakfast. Luggage keeping before and after the stay. Easy to walk around the city from the hotel. That check in was pretty late, at 15.00. Luckily we got to keep our luggage there, and got the room at 14.30."
1249,Steve,2023-07-30,2.5,"Would consider other options in future Location with parking. Staff wonderful, restaurant and menu choice very nice. Rooms becoming dated. Noisy ac which couldnt be turned off, coupled with creaky uncomfortable bed led to a very poor couple of nights sleep. Slow check out, invoice initially wrong. No one asked me how my stay was, if they had I would not have left this review"
1250,Penelope,2023-07-29,2.5,"Passable The breakfast was lovely and staff very friendly Our room was not clean, dirty cups left from previous people that had stayed and bathroom hadn't been cleaned, the bin had been left with ladies dirty sanitary products"
1251,Sarah,2023-07-29,0.5,"Disappointing as the location was really good. Location Sadly, we were delayed in being able to check in due to staff shortages. It took a long time to check in as we had to wait for a room to be available! The receptionist however was helpful and offered us complimentary drinks and a breakfast. Breakfast was not the best sadly the folllwing day."

1259,Lee,2023-07-17,3.0,"OK for a one nighter, but any longer, look elsewhere. The breakfast was very nice, the staff all very friendly and polite. very handy for the city centre. i liked the provision of a fridge empty toiletry bottles, broken pump on toiletry bottle, Showerhead was full of limescale. Quite a small room and even smaller bathroom this considering i was 'upgraded' to a King room, too small, and once the luggage bags where in, no room to pass the bed. When i booked i was offered a city view, i actually received a main road and a large overgrown tree view it was very very noisy all throughout the night. The desk chair provided was heavily stained, no complimentary biscuits with the coffee and tea. and finally i thought the charge of £20 to park my car, as a guest, on site was a little extortionate."
1260,Justine,2023-07-17,2.5,Not worth 385.00 for 3 nights Smelt nice Room was to small . Pillows were awful.

1265,Christopher,2023-07-12,1.5,"Grubby room with a sleepless night Comfortable bed. When breakfast actually arrived it was enjoyable. I had asked for some poached eggs but had to wait 20 mins (chef was busy frying eggs). Air con in my room was very loud and so I had a sleepless night. Room was generally grubby with broken panels, missing bits under the sink etc. It just felt cheap (dare I say, nasty) and old. No drinking water in the room. Really not what I would expect of a Hilton."

1272,Chris,2023-07-09,5.0,"Really, really good for a chain hotel, felt very good value for money Great location in a quieter part of the city centre. Room spacious enough for a 2-night stay, and spotlessly clean. Bar and restaurant area bright and open. Nice little outside terrace for evening drinks. Great breakfast. And, what really sets is apart, very happy and friendly staff throughout. Parking relatively limited, though there is a public car park just up the road."

Some corrections were made. I was informed upon arrival that booking the breakfast would be cheaper if booked the previous day. Although, staying alone at the hotel, my son joined me for the breakfast on 29 May and I paid for two breakfasts on 28 May. On 30 May, I had breakfast alone and paid for it on 29 May, but was charged for two full breakfasts. I am still waiting for their refund."
1280,Ann,2023-06-26,3.0,"The Premier Inn up the road does a much better breakfast and the beds are just as comfortable Location, and staff were friendly The breakfast was the worst I've ever had in a Hilton Hotel. Very limited choice, the hot dishes were unappetising to look at, so I didn't even try one. Poor quality and selection of breads. The pastries looked dry and straight out of a commercial freezer and the muffins were tiny and dry."
1281,Kerry,2023-06-26,2.5,"Avoid if you can find better value with allocated parking. Clean, good sized bed. Convenient lift. Convenient bar facility. Kettle/drinks/furniture/tv provided. Nice clean towels. Very small bathroom. Noisy air conditioner with no control for on/off. Very poor parking. Disabled at far end of car park. Once fee paid, no guarantee of space and no refund policy. Too keen to charge fee and had to find out for ourselves that there was an overspill car park, which was free! Stayed 2 nights but coffee/tea not refilled. Room not cleaned/no bins emptied."

1289,Richard,2023-06-16,3.0,"If you are happy to stay in a room that resembles a hostel then stay here. Staff were friendly and walking distance to train station. -Rooms decor looks like its from the 70s - Dustiest room ive ever stayed in. Each morning i woke up my eyes were stinging, nose iching and lungs very irritated. I don't have allergies so it must have been heavy with dust. - Bed was very uncomfortable and it smelt musty and old. - Aircon wasn't cold. - Room was tiny - I had 2 terrible nights of very broken sleep. - Im surprised the Hilton would put their name on this hotel to be honest."
1290,Gordon,2023-06-15,5.0,I thought Hilton Garden Inn very comfortable and in a convenient location. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hygiene was of a very high standard. The food was very good. I cannot think of anything I did not like.

1298,Maxine,2023-06-03,2.5,"Room and restaurant service fine. Male Receptionist in wrong job!  We checked to see if there were electric charging points. When we got there the 3 points were occupied by non-electric cars which remained for our entire 20 hour stay. There is no system for checking number plates, so they couldn’t be contacted. When my husband politely complained, the (male) receptionist told him he was being aggressive!! We had huge difficulties in finding the hotel entrance as there are road works and no signage. The receptionist on duty when we arrived (Bailey) was very apologetic and upgraded our room."

I found the bed was a bit high so had to take a run and jump to get up there,much to the delight of my granddaughter.we loved our room. The hotel is quite a walk into shopping area,which would be ok if I didn’t have a painful back,not anything to do with the hotel of course, but if I came again I would choose somewhercloser to town. The tea in the room was organic , and not much milk etc.but the wonderful evening staff found me some English tea and supplied milk. But these were just niggles from someone my age."

Apparently they have 175 rooms and about 50 parking spaces which if it's available you can pay $20 a day for parking.. however that does not guarantee you a parking spot when you come back to the parking lot.. I did get reimbursed for my charges on parking but it just was frustrating coming back at night and there's no parking spaces and then you got to go out at night trying to find one on the street somewhere where you don't get a ticket

1335,Andrew,2023-04-18,1.0,"Building Site The reception staff were very welcoming on our arrival and gave great information on various sites in Bristol. Where do I start? I booked a room with a city view and despite 75% of the Hotel having this I was given a room facing a building site and awoke to find 3 builders directly opposite my window hammering scaffolding together! The mattress was too hars and the pilliwa had no support whatsoever leading to a night of very patchy sleep. Breakfast was barely lukewarm and the bacon was almost raw. So disappointing to have paid for something that was not delivered. Some kind of recompense is definitely in order, I would never use Hilton again!"

1339,Ask,2023-04-13,2.0,Value for money - below standard. Location is great. Staff were fairly helpful especially Ms. Bailey. Male staff could do with a bit of CS retraining. The bed was awful. I could feel the springs. TV screen I believe is quite old ( remote is over used) and so pretty poor on brightness (remote worn out so cannot really adjust brightness). Why are there so much storage spaces - room feels very crammed. Carpets old - perhaps a thorough cleaning is in order. Sorry for the negative feedback. Remember this is Hilton! Expectations are high as the room rates are also high.

1342,Stephen,2023-04-09,1.0,Wish I'd stayed at the Premier Inn instead. Location was ok Comedy shower with inwards opening door so you can't get in and close it! Design probably necessitated by too small bathroom. Room seemed poorly prepared. Needed a good hoovering. Tea and coffee facilities not replenished and cups and spoons needed a wash. Bed very creaky and hard.
1343,Dudley,2023-04-08,5.0,very professional very comfortable. Breakfast was absolutely amazing and the shower was divine. shower was absolutely amazing and the bed was extremely comfortable I believe there wasn’t anything I dislike at this place
1344,Richard,2023-04-07,3.0,Pleasant  We were not advised that access to the hotel by car was a nightmare due to a combination of a need to find a way to the back of the hotel/car park and the extensive building works taking place in the area. Also a room in a 4 star hotel should provide a spare and more than two breakfast tea sachets - along with others.
1345,Amanda,2023-04-06,5.0,"Exceptional From the moment we walked in the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the reception staff, we stayed for 2 nights and our room was on floor 5, it was very clean, tea and coffee provided, a hairdryer, iron & ironing board, towels, shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, the beds were so comfy and the room was quite. We had breakfast, which you can have full breakfast, continental, fruit, waffles, tea coffee, juices. Hotel is close to shops pubs restaurants, about 15 minute walk through temple park (opposite hotel )then turn right up to Bristol Bridge, reception will give you a map and show you. We will definitely recommend and would stay again. For us there was nothing to dislike."
1346,Allen,2023-04-03,3.0,"Pleasant Friendly and professional staff especially Anna on reception Heating in room not working, having to change rooms late at night was not good when we were very tired"
1347,Kearney,2023-04-03,5.0,"Exceptional Near to the town centre ,very friendly staff, breakfast was lovely"
1348,Gemma,2023-04-01,2.0,"It was somewhere to put our head down but wouldn’t recommend or come back. Staff were pleasant and location was easy to find. The restaurant area was modern and looked well presented. The rooms were extremely plain, the cream carpets were stained and looked dirty. The bed was the worst thing of all. It was extremely uncomfortable, hard and noisy when moving in bed. The noise would wake me/partner up every time I tossed and turned. The parking cost was extremely expensive too."
1349,Jemma,2023-03-30,3.0,"Pleasant basic, good location, the bed was very noisy."
1350,Anne,2023-03-29,5.0,Great overnight stay to pick up a new car. A great hotel to stay with parking. Good service in the restaurant. Great shower and comfortable bed. Very easy check in. The weather!!!
1351,Mikee,2023-03-28,5.0,Exceptional Breakfast was great
1352,Luis,2023-03-27,5.0,Exceptional The staff is simply amazing.
1353,Ian,2023-03-27,3.0,"Pleasant friendly staff, breakfast felt like we were in a Travelodge which was shame for an upgraded room it felt like a standard room The breakfast wasn't what we expected especially for a Hilton hotel"
1354,Matthew,2023-03-27,1.0,"A far cry from what I expected from the 'Hilton' brand. I was compensated, with a free meal, for the various mistakes made by the hotel reception staff. When I arrived, I was told my booking did not include breakfast (which I had booked). Desiring breakfast, I was asked to pay there and then. Fine. But the card machine was broken. So I paid in cash and was told it would be taken off may bill when I checked out. When I ate in the restaurant that evening with my colleague, for which we asked to be billed separately, they billed us incorrectly - the billed my colleague for everything. So we had to pend 10 minutes sorting this out on checkout next morning. Also during checkout, I was told (by a different staff member) that I had overpaid for breakfast because my original booking did in fact include breakfast. Again this cost about 5 minutes of checkout time. In all, the reception experience was really dire. Nobody seemed to know what they were doing ir why mistakes had been made. As I said, this was helped by the removal of charge for my evening meal. However, my morning at the Hilton had already been tarnished by a rude breakfast chef. Still tired, I stood at the counter playing some hot items on my plate, when out of nowhere I was barred at by the chef for not putting the bacon tongs on a special resting plate in front of the tray. I had in fact picked up the tongs from where I;d left them, in the tray. I was taken aback by this rudeness - how are guests supposed to know this detail? the chef was doing nothing else than watch people do this over again. He could have replaced the tongs himself, or at least said 'good morning' first and perhaps 'sorry, sir, would you mind leaving the tongs on the plate in front"". When I made it clear that I was put out by his conduct, he started arguing with me, about how I should do what I was told. Really ridiculous. It raised stress levels that I really didn't need to be raised and is so easily avoidable. In short, the staff experience during my stay was pretty poor - either through basic incompetence or rudeness."
1355,Craig,2023-03-20,5.0,Great location and amazing staff location is excellent nothing
1356,Vicky,2023-03-20,5.0,A very nice and relaxing stay. The staff were great and showed care and professionalism when approaching my sisters condition (coeliac). I was made to feel comfortable and relaxed. The food was very good and was served in good time. The room was lovely and we didn't hear any outdoor noise. There was no information in the room about the time of breakfast or if food was available to order to the room.
1357,Liz,2023-03-19,1.5,"Very disappointed would not stay here again  Towels that were yellow and smelt stale and musty. Most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in , wooden frame creaked with every movement. Shower temperature could not be controlled"
1358,Serge,2023-03-17,2.5,"Passable  No hand soap at basin, only 2 sheets of kleenex, no bags for sanitary towels (though not reqd. male). Not noticed on arrival 'cos hidden by curtain, window open all night, hence cold, and air con trying to maintain temp ran all the time! Mentioned to reception."
1359,Iain,2023-03-13,3.0,"Good location, friendly staff, but the room had some basic problems. Great location near the train station, really friendly staff, easy check-in. No blankets or topsheet (in winter), the desk drawer was broken, and the shower door was a struggle to close. Nothing big, but it just felt a bit substandard."
1360,Daryl,2023-03-13,2.0,Disappointing Location was OK. Breakfast was great Room was small very tired Heating didn't work No tissues or bottled water
1361,Laura,2023-03-13,3.0,"Uncomfortable beds and too hot Good location with easy access to many attractions. There was less traffic noise than I was expecting. The man on the front desk was a bit snippy, if I'm honest. Yes we checked in 20 minutes early but he could have dropped the attitude. The rooms were far too hot and the bed was uncomfortable. The showerhead holder was held together with glue and wasn't secure, so kept falling on me. Overall, a very average hotel."
1362,Dave,2023-03-13,2.0,Disappointing Comfy bed Hot water Cleaners being loud talking Hoovers running in the hall ways from 9 am
1363,Sarah,2023-03-13,3.0,Not as good as we were expecting Breakfast was fantastic! The check in staff were really friendly and helpful The room was quite small and dated. Patches of mould in the bathroom. No hand wash
1364,Hannah,2023-03-10,5.0,"Great hotel Really friendly and helpful staff, great location, room was comfy and clean, parking available The breakfast was okay but there wasn't any tomatoes or mushrooms, things were not restocked when they ran out"
1365,Tim,2023-03-05,3.0,"Pleasant stay, good location, helpful staff. Staff were very helpful and polite when we discovered a problem with our original room - bad odour. Underlying mechanical noise in the room."
1366,Penny,2023-03-05,2.0,"Disappointing The breakfast was good quality and good value. The room was basic, the fridge wasn't switched on. We could not get it to work even though it was plugged in. There were no teaspoons to stir you coffer or tea.. it was chilly in the room and the warm air conditioning did not work. Apart from that the bed was comfy 😌"
1367,Bryce,2023-03-02,5.0,"Perfect hotel for a weekend city break Staff were very friendly and welcoming . Hotel was well managed , spotlessly clean and fresh . Substantial buffet breakfast included in my choice of booking. I think for some it would be to far out from the centre of Bristol for visitors who cannot walk great distances. On the plus side , close to transport links. Distance wasn’t a huge issue for me ."
1368,Jason,2023-03-01,2.5,It was ok  Very cold in room Thin duvet No additional bedding Air con VERY NOISEY
1369,Nigel,2023-02-27,5.0,Absolutely fantastic Brilliant
1370,05awhitehouse,2023-02-23,2.0,I wouldn't stay again. Very disappointed The breakfast and their fragrance in the reception £187 and the heater didn't work in the room. I was honestly shocked. A gas radiator had to be wheeled in. Beds were really uncomfortable too. I've had much better stays in a hostel. I'd recommend the ibis or holiday inn express nearby instead for the Cost difference.
1371,Lauren,2023-02-22,1.5,"Poor  uncomfortable HARD beds, cold room, heating sounded like an aeroplane taking off constantly so had to switch off. expensive stay for one night with poor facilities. very dated rooms."
1372,Donna,2023-02-21,2.0,it done the job but for a Hilton very poor the location was ok and wen u walked into the reception it smelt lovely the rooms was like a shoe box and wen the heating went on it was like a generator in the bedroom and for a Hilton it was very poor
1373,Sandra,2023-02-14,5.0,very enjoyable it was central located. very good position
1374,Lee,2023-02-14,2.5,"Stay Elsewhere Located in the centre of Bristol, which met my needs as i had a meeting nearby. First of all don't be taken in by booking.com offering a free upgrade, as all the rooms are exactly the same, and the bathrooms are tiny. The location of the hotel is decent, but trying to get access to it was a nightmare, with the one way system, roads closed and excessive building work nearby. The hotel itself was more like a Travelodge style, and something you don't really relate to, with the Hilton brand name. And the cleaners need to have a word with themselves, as the bin in the bathroom was full of used sanitary products, which i presume was left by the previous occupant, and when i informed reception, all they said was ""sorry about that"" and wasn't interested in the least. The breakfast wasn't really for me, as I'm not a fan of buffet style breakfasts."
1375,Paul,2023-02-13,2.5,"Nice hotel but felt a bit disappointed with the experience overall. I wouldn’t rush back. The hotel is well located and smartly decorated. The additional charge of £20 for parking for 24 hours was a bit excessive. We had to wait a fair amount of time to check in, as there were only two members of staff on the desk. The room we stayed in was decorated nicely and smart at first glance, but after spending some time in there, I noticed quite a few stains all over the carpet and a big stain on the curtains. Breakfast was another additional charge, which we had to wait another ten minutes for a table and the food was pretty standard."
1376,Paul,2023-02-12,3.0,"not a bad stay but wouldn't rush back. location was good for local destinations. also breakfast was great value. The rooms are small, The televisions are out dated as only really 5 channels. So the rooms look tired and could do with modernizing."
1377,Michelle,2023-02-08,2.0,"convenient close to train station and centre have stayed before and been very happy with room but this room was not nice. walls stained and dirty, paint chipped from skirting and walls. room looked uncared for."

1382,Timothy,2023-01-19,1.5,freezing ! location it was freezing in my room. the hotel provided and extra plug in radiator but it wasn’t powerful enough to heat the room. Hilton hotels vary so much in quality - this hotel is in desperate need of an update… especially the air con / heating situation.
1383,Sharon,2023-01-17,5.0,"hotel perfect close to the venue Restaurant quite expensive, quality not great"
1384,Yvonne,2023-01-16,5.0,"Excellent short stay Reception staff, cleanliness, facilities, breakfast..all excellent 👏 Paying £16 for parking"
1385,Smokybarnable,2023-01-07,2.5,More like two star hotel The breakfast was quite good. Many different options to choose from. Pretty short walk from train station. For a four star hotel this felt more like a two star. Really old and outdated tired room. Air conditioning difficult to operate. Very noisy street below our room. Overpriced and not cozy.
1386,Michelle,2023-01-07,3.0,disappointed because it was cold in the property clean it was very cold
1387,Justin,2023-01-05,0.5,Rubbish Location ok The bathroom was dirty and stafff rude and Iv rang to complain not a phone call back very rude I call it and if I don’t hear from anyone one I will put the photos of the bathroom up for other to see
1388,Von,2023-01-03,2.5,"Dispute the minute and insignificant difficulties we experienced during our stay, this was more than made up for by the The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. They assisted with advice on local attractions, with calling taxi services, and with extra assistance when needed. Perfect customer service. Everything was very clean with essentials being catered for e.g. shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer. As a wheelchair user, I was very impressed that the hotel had the initiative to use sensor rather than pedal bins in their disabled toilets (this is a bugbear of mine) ❤️ I am a wheelchair user. Although an accessible room was made available; the inside was furnished with carpet, making movement within the room more energy consuming; also there was a lip on the door frame, making it difficult to enter the room (chair tipping and opening a fire door is hard); and the initial room we were directed to had electrical issues (no plugs working)."
1389,Kokila,2022-12-31,5.0,"Exceptional The short footpath from the back access to the Knights Templar Church ruins. Beautiful and fascinating Medieval structure, the preserved exterior of it. Everything else except... Air con noisy in room. Shower was cool/cold."

1391,Nigel,2022-12-29,3.0,Pleasant Hotel is well placed and well appointed with comfortable rooms. During my stay there was an issue with water supply resulting in no hot water and while I realise this was not caused by the hotel I was only offered an explanation by staff when asking specifically about the problem and there was no apology for the disruption. Quality of the breakfast was poor on the occasion I stayed.

Manager was very helpful and friendly thank you :) The hotel room didn’t lock at all there was no need for a room card…. so please check before you stay, we only found out once we returned from an outing in which we left our belongings in the room. There was also food left in the fridge."

All in all a very disappointing experience"
1403,Kamaljit,2022-12-02,3.0,Basic but clean Pleasant and friendly staff. Hotel is basic but clean. Toiletries weren't good and smelt awful. Decor is basic and needs updating. Some problem with water coming from tap and shower for a period in the morning. It was just a trickle.

1451,Christopher,2022-09-18,2.5,"Location great, feel its a little expensive for the facilities and standard level off room Lactation was perfect for us as we just a short walk away from the Hippodrome for a show. Plenty of choice at breakfast and food was tasty. Upon arrival I was informed at reception that there is a £16 fee to use the hotel carpark. Nowhere did I see this mentioned when booking the hotel. I have never had to do this in any other hotel I've visited. I feel this extra charge made my stay not great value for money with this extra charge on top."

1457,Alexander,2022-09-09,2.0,"Not worth the money! Location Ground floor accessible room allocated when requested high floor room, dated in places, bathroom sliding door didn’t open and close properly. Not asked how my Stay was at reception checking out and hot breakfast was cold- bacon and hash brown."

1459,Lou,2022-09-08,2.5,Urgent refurbishment required Nothing Now a very tired hotel. Needs total refurbishment to meet the Hilton group standards! Definitely not worth the money
1460,Sara,2022-09-04,5.0,"Exceptional Great location, very clean and modern. Friendly.,helpful staff, good value buffet breakfast with great selection. The shower wasn't as powerful as we like."
1461,Ben,2022-09-04,2.5,"Passable I had high hopes for this hotel as I associate the Hilton with nice properties. When we arrived at our room it absolutely stank of cigarette smoke. There was constant noise throughout the night in the corridor which was not stopped by anyone . The bed wasn’t very comfortable . to be fair, the staff were all very pleasant it was just the room that let it down- we paid a little more to stay in this nicer hotel and would have had a better time in a cheaper competitor ."
1462,Karin,2022-08-30,5.0,Just what we were looking for. Great value and location close to the city centre. very friendly helpful staff. rel pillows too big
1463,Bland,2022-08-30,3.0,"All in all positive experience, would return staff were extremely friendly and helpful. light didn’t work in wardrobe, no shower gel in bottle in the shower. Attention to detail with these things could be improved"
1464,Traveller,2022-08-30,1.5,"Not value for money  Breakfast was poor quality, poached eggs were drowned in vinegar, cheese was dry and curling and salad was old Room hadn’t been cleaned properly and was dusty, soaps were empty and hadn’t been refilled No room cleaning on the third day Pillows very thin No plug socket on both sides of bed"
1465,Kevin,2022-08-29,3.0,clean and tidy but not again due to price and location. location parking and run down area of the city
1466,Edwin,2022-08-29,3.0,"It was ok. for the price goodish. It was clean and the staff delightful Over my life I have stayed at many Hiltons, all very good, to mention Park Lane , London and many times at The Gatwick Hilton, delightful. I was mislead maybe because of the name Hilton, The Hotel I stayed in was not a Hilton, my fault as I should have considered the price more, but there it is, it was just an average good hotel."
1467,Julia,2022-08-29,2.5,Bristol trip Location good and the knight templer history in close proximity Very hard bed. The bed had wheels made alot of noise especially whilst turning in bed.. One morning the breakfast was cold I had to as ask for it to be microwaved.
1468,Mathew,2022-08-23,2.5,Disappointed. Expected more from the Hilton brand.. Breakfast was as expected Unable to get served food on both evenings of our stay. Arrived early evening expecting to be able to eat in the hotel restaurant- unable to be served as the Restuarant had a block booking on both nights. Very disappointed. Not even offered a snack or sandwich 😦
1469,Allan,2022-08-23,1.0,This straw broke the camel’s (and my) back Location is brilliant for my office. Staff are welcoming and friendly despite the challenges they have to overcome. Beds are the worst I have ever slept in (including wartime German bunks) Air conditioning was so noisy it couldn’t be used at night despite 20 degree heat outside Desk light didn’t work so couldn’t work in the evening. Reported it but nobody came to sort it out. Room was not cleaned or replenished for the two nights I was there The restaurant couldn’t feed staying guests for the two nights because of large coach parties booked in Such a shame because our two businesses use this hotel on a regular basis but we’re moving up the road.
1470,Alexander,2022-08-21,1.5,"Poor Air con didn't work, so we were moved to another room by the really nice staff. They sorted this ASAP. Amazing beds! Very clean and nice decor. Our floor smelled of weed, I think the people in the room opposite were smoking it. Creeped through our door and all our stuff started to smell of it slightly. The TV's in the room are awful. Old, non HD, wouldn't work as intended. We found it really slow/hard to change channels etc."
1471,Paul,2022-08-21,3.0,"We were a little disappointed with certain aspects of the room we were allocated The staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast was good. Overall, the cleanliness of the room and shower room was good. Charge of £16 to Park in the hotel car park was rather high. The bed and pillows were very hard and difficult to sleep on. Bottles of shower gel/shampoo in the shower were all empty. Carpet was rather tired with old stains"
1472,Ceri,2022-08-16,1.5,Wouldn’t stay here again Some staff were lovely. Room not ready upon arrival even though I’d stated an arrival time. Dirty linen in corridors every day. Beds uncomfortable and creaking.Breakfast poor overcooked bacon undercooked sausages and cold eggs. Restaurant closed one night no prior notice given. Everything
1473,Amelia,2022-08-15,5.0,"Enjoyable , relaxing , great service Facilities , staff , lovely food at restaurant and the choice at breakfast . Bedroom was nice Carpark was very expensive saying you’ve paid a lot already booking a room . Also air con not very powerful in the rooms especially during the hot weather"
1474,Matt,2022-08-15,0.5,"Very bad nights sleep Location to harbour side The room was stiflingly hot, the air conditioning was not working across the whole hotel. I asked for a fan which the staff provided but it just blew hot air around the room. We did not sleep at all... I expected a lot more from a Hilton hotel. The was also no pre warning of this, had there been we'd have chosen a different hotel!"
1475,Minnette,2022-08-12,5.0,"we come every year, great hotel great staff it was easily accessible, clean and refreshing lemon water was on tap in reception brilliant the cooler didn’t work but we’re offered another room but we were just along from my brothers room"
1476,Elke,2022-08-11,3.0,Pleasant Location was good and the park behind the hotel was beautiful. The staff were nice. It was really expensive for what it was and U looked on other days and the price was a lot less and included breakfast. We paid £260 for two night twin room and breakfast wasn't included - although I thought it was supposed to be. It was really loud on our first night over night.
1477,Mrs,2022-08-10,3.0,"Pleasant, but with flaws..... Best thing ,i have to say was the chef and restaurant staff,for our breakfast the following morning...I have ms and eat particuler food combinations..Not totally strange, but most places, find requests hard at times...My husband enjoyed his big breakfast immensely(he's a normal)..and mine 2 eggs on avocado(no toast) ...perfect...even made me a smoothie to drink...Great start to the day and rounded, a not so great start to our break to, excellent....People sometimes need to remember ,that it's the small things that count............... Reception on arrival...Was a hot day, and our journey was full of traffic, not the hotels fault granted...BUT,..We were due to check-in at 3pm and didnt arrive till 4.15...to find room not ready??..Sitting in lobby and left with the option of 'choc or crisps' ...no...So as receptionist didnt see the need to give/suggest another ready room, i did her job and approached to ask for another ready room...Granted........See not hard...BUT would have been better some forsight on her part....The Hilton Garden Inn, not a chain that i would think needed a customer service skills reminder...........!"

1483,Steven,2022-08-06,5.0,"Great hotel to visit Friendly service, Annie and Jenny on front desk were so kind and helpful. Annie went over and above to help us with accommodation for late arrival of my son who needed 2 rooms for his family which made a difficult situation easily sorted out. Can't thank her enough also for giving us ground floor room as my wife's legs were bad and she doesn't like lifts. Wonderful experience all round and will definitely be back on our next visit to Bristol. Lovely staff good breakfast EXCELLENT."
1484,Samantha,2022-08-06,5.0,"The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and we had a wonderful stay! I love the property, it’s always clean and tidy and the rooms are great value for money. But the staff are the greatest. Nothing to dislike"

1486,Tammie,2022-08-04,3.0,"Could have been better Staff were really pleasant and helpful. Restaurant and bar area was lovely and breakfast was great. Our room was an accessible room and felt a little snug. Bed was small but comfortable. Window led out onto the street making the room feel a little overlooked and the rubber seal around the window was loose and hanging. The bathroom was brilliant - plenty of room with excellent facilities but the door would not close properly. The ceiling especially, but also the walls and skirt boards were marked or scuffed, giving the room an overall tired feel."

1488,Michael,2022-08-04,5.0,"Could not have wished for a better stay, made very welcomed and even the weather held.

The bathroom was a little small, could not turn the heating right down but that could be me"
1489,Natalie,2022-08-02,5.0,Exceptional Hotel was Ok bed comfortable and nice shower. For the price of £9.50 breakfast was not worth is very sparse options and what was there wasn't great. Coffee there was terrible. overall for the price of the room I paid £320 for two nights it was not worth it.
1490,Mark,2022-07-31,2.5,Basic and not a value for money Room was basic but ok The hotel is weary and in need of some renovations.
1491,David,2022-07-31,2.5,"Disappointing - not like I expect a Hilton to be The staff were very helpful Room was too hot, bed was tiny, roadworks all round the hotel made it impossible to get to using sat nav, and had to end up ringing hotel.

The full English breakfasts was cooked lovely. they had a really good range of other options too, such as fruit cereals meats /cheese ect. They made it really special for us by popping proceco in our room on ice. At a reasonable charge.They called to confirm everything before our stay too! Thankyou to all the staff we will be back again. We didn't have any issues with the rooms or facility's but some mini toothpaste in the room?"

1501,Linda,2022-07-15,3.0,"Have had much better experience at other Hilton’s . it had a wardrobe in the room ( missing at premier inns) fridge was very handy . The shower was pathetic no pressure what so ever , hard mattress, very hard and uncomfortable pillows, bar person unhelpful , I can’t believe you don’t stock a 2nd bottle of Malibu . the measure was the last bit in the bottom but due to it being about 3mm short of the full measured barman refused to serve it , he refused to see if you had further stock just said you didn’t without looking . A bit of a disappointing visit . your standards appear to have dropped."
1502,Brian,2022-07-12,3.0,"Pokey room and don't arrive hungry! Check in/out was efficient Access with a car is impossible. You have to turn into a one-way street, going the wrong way, from the main road. Otherwise, you can't access it. GoogleMaps can't even find the correct entrance. No filter coffee for breakfast - only Americano from a full automatic. Dreadful. I arrived at 22:15 and couldn't even get a sandwich. The kitchen closes at 21:45 and there's nothing nearby. I ended up walking 2km to a McD and eating it in a bus shelter!"

1510,Michelle,2022-06-28,3.0,Hard mattress and nothing extra to justify paying the Hilton price. Close to the train station and some shops and restaurants are not too far away. The bed was too hard. Considering the hotel was a Hilton I expected something more.

1524,Anthea,2022-06-13,2.5,"Short Break Friendly staff, comfy bed, nice small gym with modern equipment and clean communal areas. Terrible parking. Bays should be allocated on booking to allow guests to come and go as they please rather than be to scared to drive as they will not get a space on return. Stains on the blackout blinds looked like oil, room small for two adults, no usb points in these modern times, room was clean but looked a bit old fashioned. Small bathroom, paint flaking above shower. Bit far from restaurants if you have to walk as you don't want to lose your parking space."

Room great and an amazingly good breakfast The only thing I didn't like was seeing the red indicator below this box that I am writing in slowly change to green as I type....there was nothing that we could fault with our stay at Browns. I am sure that many other people go and stay at places with the sole purpose to find fault...if only they bothered to engage with the people who run and work in hospitality not treat them and what they do with disdain and a negative outlook. It's green now, so I'll stop!"
1550,Joanne,2022-05-07,2.5,avoid at the weekend if you like to sleep room was clean and comfortable. bed and bathroom fine. nice park to look out on to. whole corridor on which we stayed became a party venue with people rolling in at 0230 shouting singing banging doors. managed to drown out the party noise by hiking up the aircon but could still hear the doors banging as they went from room to room. kept awake from 0230 until the sun came up about 0530. reception useless. no signs anywhere asking people to be quiet when coming in late. no security to deal with the yobs. Travelodge and Premier Inn have family corridors and signage asking people to be considerate when coming in late. reception said that it was too difficult for the Hilton to arrange this. won’t be back. very disappointed. if you can’t sleep properly at a hotel it’s failed really hasn’t it?

1565,Rachel,2022-04-17,3.0,"Extremely Disappointing Property was in a good location. Rooms are tired and dirty. The bed was on wheels and had to be the loudest bed I’ve ever slept on. Noise levels were high, hoovering early in the morning. Would not stay again."
1566,Eric,2022-04-15,5.0,A great break to celebrate our anniversary. Room had nice view and was quiet. The hotel was close to the railway station with a very easy walk. We had an evening meal which was well prepared and the staff were cheerful and attentive. Shower room extraction fan not working

1571,Henry,2022-04-05,5.0,"One night stay, very comfortable and very pleasant and helpful staff. I stayed on the 4th floor and the room was really clean and tidy. There was not much noise other than what you would expect from a hotel. It's not that it put me off the hotel, as it didn't, but the facility to have water to drink in the room would have been an added bonus, Though there is a massive water cooler in the reception, it's not practical to come up and down from the 4th floor to get some."
1572,Andrew,2022-04-04,5.0,Exceptional The best hotel 🏨 👌 All of it the room was great and the food thank you
1573,Keris,2022-04-04,5.0,Exceptional Staff very friendly and accommodating
1574,Colin,2022-04-04,3.0,"frustrating Hilton to me is synonymous with quality which to be honest was found a little wanting. staff were pretty good when you pointed things out to them. had some discount on bills because of things going wrong. Booked king room, shown into a normal room. had to be relocated once we pointed this out . TV non functional which apparently was the same in all the rooms, staff had reported it apparently but it was an issue for all of our stay and had been for the previous week. Bit of plastic bag found in my soup, directions to hotel need updating due to all the construction work taking place in the vicinity,"
1575,Samantha,2022-04-04,5.0,"Great 👍 Breakfast was great. Staff very friendly and helpful. Room & whole hotel was very clean Only 2 tv channels working but reception staff provided free drinks as compensation, so we were quite happy!"

1577,Fiona,2022-04-01,5.0,"Exceptional Ease of walking into town - you're by the waterfront within 10 minutes. The actual hotel isn't in the nicest location, but we knew that before we arrived, so weren't diaappointed."
1578,Timothy,2022-03-28,1.5,Poor The cocktails Being over charged at the end of are stay though the mistake of the hotel staff.and the large amount of dust in our room also and the lack of information in the room.and the breakfast was absolutely disgusting.
1579,Allan,2022-03-28,3.0,"Enjoyed Bristol with the hotel being close to Temple Meads and the water ferry. Handy for Temple Meads and not too far to walk to the city centre. The hotel is clean and modern i.e. with the uniformity that goes with new-builds. For the price I would have expected more space in the room and en-suite. The hotel is having problems with its supplier and many of the electronics don't work adequately - wi-fi and tv. Breakfast was buffet style and over-priced, with the lamp-warmers seemingly placed too high to adequately warm the food."

1581,Bernice,2022-03-24,5.0,Exceptional The decor was lovely .. beautiful dining room .. staff were extremely helpful . There was a lovely smell of a diffuser that I really liked The noise when you opened the window but that’s only to be expected due to the location
1582,Christopher,2022-03-24,1.5,Poor Location room was no where near the same standard as other city centre Hilton’s we have stayed in and way to much money for the lack of quality.
1583,Helen,2022-03-21,5.0,"every member do staff were amazing especially Peter and Annie on the desk. great rooms, good view and great shower and toiletries and fantastic friendly staff nothing"
1584,Melissa,2022-03-20,5.0,"Well-situated, clean and complete amenities First hotel with a laundry room instead of the overpriced laundry services. it was super helpful. for me this was the best perk ever. breakfast is good with various choices for every taste, gym is clean, view to park is nice. close to the train station, which is convenient. Friendly staff. Overall very satisfied."
1585,Dimple,2022-03-20,2.5,"Passable Location, staff, breakfast was good but not available for long enough. Room wasnt super clean, was run down. Toiletries available were limited. Disappointing for a hilton."
1586,Dan,2022-03-20,2.0,"Room was fine, facilities not. Night staff also rude. Room was clean One tv channel worked, asked the staff about it ended up with two members of staff in my room at unsocial-able hours trying to get to wire at the back of the tv when I told them it was already not possible as I had looked myself they insisted on staying in the room and messing with the remote which again I had told them I had already done so and then became rude when I asked them to leave and stayed for more longer than needed."
1587,Tony,2022-03-18,2.0,"overpriced, room price inflated due to Cheltenham race’s which we were unaware room rate was £100 dearer than normal and location small room, very small bathroom, noisy heating system"
1588,Clare,2022-03-14,2.0,"ok, I suppose! good location! uncomfortable bed, no water or fresh milk in the refrigerator. bed unmade on arrival! small bathroom. Tv was very slow to work! staff were lovely apart from one gentleman on the Monday morning!"
1589,Alison,2022-03-13,2.5,"Passable Location very good, hotel seemed in reasonable condition Two nights in a row I was awake between 3am and 4.30am with noise of drunk people in rooms nearby and in the hallway. I let the hotel know after the first night, they sent me a message to apologise and said they would keep an eye out the next night. The 2nd night was worse. Music and people in room next door, people in corridor shouting to try find their room because they couldn't find key or remember where they were staying, trying random doors, slamming doors. I gave the feedback to the receptionist as I checked out and she apologised and says it wasn't within their control. I beg to differ. I have travelled at lot with work over the years and this was not acceptable; its your hotel, you make the rules. You knew there was potential for disturbance and did not take responsibility."
1590,Charlotte,2022-03-06,2.5,Passable Location was good Beds were really uncomfortable. Doors banging throughout the night until 3am. Worst nights sleep I’ve had in a long time. Room was tiny.

1592,Sandra,2022-03-01,5.0,Exceptional Great location near train station and shopping centre.. Super friendly and helpful staff.. The only fault personal to me was the bed was to firm.. took some getting used to.. But a lot of people like a firm bed..

The breakfast had a good variety of choice and was well presented and good quality. The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. There was nothing to fault
1596,Joanne,2022-02-24,3.0,"Nice stay but overpriced Room was very clean but quite small despite upgrading. Location was good, Breakfast was excellent. Staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant was very overpriced so ate out Stayed at a premier inn for the first night and felt the extra 40 pounds extra to stay at the Hilton didn't warrant the price. Premier had much larger rooms, nice bar and restaurant. However breakfast was not as good as the Hilton. Unfortunately due to location and value for money I would return to the premier Inn which is a shame."

1606,Chloe,2022-02-06,1.0,"poor  we were given our room key at check in, went to our room to find is was already occupied, what was supposed to be our treat night away was completely turned upside down. we complained at reception to be told we gave you the wrong room number, no effort made to right the wrongs. I will be leaving reviews on social media platforms and trip advisor. we paid £114 for a stay that was a complete shamble."
1607,Lowri,2022-01-30,5.0,Great location and staff couldn’t be more helpful. It was a pleasure to stay here and would not hesitate to re-book when Great location and customer service. There were a couple of stains on the curtains but did not affect function in anyway.

There was also somewhere to store luggage The bed definitely was not as comfortable as I was expecting from a Hilton. The bar was also very basic and standard, I was hoping for something a bit more stylish or special. Not a great deal of selection of drinks. It didnt feel any better than a budget hotel."
1610,Lois,2022-01-26,2.5,"stay was ok but unacceptable that the fire alarm went off at 2.15am due to other guests setting it off by accident. no a clean, great location fire alarm going off at 2.15am"

1613,Paul,2022-01-24,3.0,"Nice enough but never coming back, overpriced for what you get. Friendly staff, good location. Parking on site (albeit chargeable) Room was small, bed too firm, pillows were awful had a terrible sleep. For some reason there was an extra chair in the room that did nothing but get in the way as it was too big. Breakfast was OK but items had been sat around for a while - the poached eggs were hard boiled."
1614,Ei,2022-01-23,5.0,Exceptional I couldn't express how much I was satisfied with this Hilton Garden Inn. The room was extremely clean and we can smell the good washing from the blankets and the pillows. The people who give services were also nice and polite. 100% Thumb-up!

1622,Elizabeth,2022-01-05,3.0,Disappointing but didn't ruin our stay. The hotel was clean The room was a lot smaller than expected especially after paying for an upgrade. The king sized bed was two singles pushed together and the 'garden view' was the road.

1632,Serena,2021-12-20,0.5,"Unsafe  There were guests banging on the walls, screaming in the hallway and knocking on the room of my door right the way through the night. At 3.30am I went downstairs to tell reception, and as I came back up to my room after this - a man in nothing but his underwear was stood outside my hotel room door. I felt extremely uncomfortable and unsafe. After telling the night staff, the noise stopped for about 30 minutes then commenced again at 4am. Myself and my friend in my twin room got no sleep. My friend decided to leave the hotel at 5.30am because all the banging and knocking on our door made them have a panic attack. I did not feel safe either and did not get any sleep"

1662,Laura,2021-11-16,5.0,"A very nice, clean, comfortable hotel to spend a couple of nights in Bristol The room was surprisingly nice! I had not expected it to look so new and modern and it was impeccably clean. The bed was big and EXTREMELY comfortable - my partner has back issues and this mattress was one of the few during our trip that he felt at ease sleeping on. The place had plenty of mirrors for getting ready to go out for a night or for a walkabout in the morning. It also had a lot of storage available in the room. The hotel provided shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap, and body lotion (as per usual), but they smelled very nice and didn't feel cheap like so many often do. The wifi was very strong and we had no issues getting online. The room was very quiet. We didn't hear any of the other guests or anyone on the street outside during our stay despite only staying on the first floor. The view from the windows of the park across was nice, though best experienced in the day as not much could be seen at night. The hotel was very easy to navigate. Parking was very simple. We were able to get a 24-hour parking pass from the time of our arrival and keep the car in the small lot just in front of the hotel making our worries about leaving our car in a lot down the street unnecessary. The fee for the 24-hour stay was only £16, very affordable compared to the other park and pay options in the area. The staff were very helpful at check-in and check-out. Nothing comes to mind - the stay was very pleasant and everything you would hope for from a night in a hotel in a new city. The only blip was with the parking fee. We thought we paid the fee at check-in but the clerk was a bit busy and must not have completed the transaction so we received a bill for parking in the morning after thinking that we had already paid for it. It was easily worked out at the front desk at checkout and the money had not been taken from our account. So it was a non-issue in the end."

1667,Keith,2021-11-15,3.0,"Adequate were not at the hotel due to being out all day. The closeness to Temple Mead Station. The room being ready before normal check in. The well trained staff. The room was of adequate size but rather tired , stains to carpet, dressing table drawers falling to pieces so drawers did not shut. we had booked into the Recess bar /restaurant . we had looked at the on line menu and the prices seemed reasonable although menu was not very extensive . We arrived for our 6.30 booking the the noise from a large group of drinkers was horrendous - not good when you suffer from tinnitus; the menu was even more reduced; the prices had gone up and the portions very small my husbands piece of fish was the size of a childs portion. My Husband received a charge docket which he signed very surprised to find additional charges for service and and tips. If there was a note on the menu re these charges it was that small it was missed."

It´s a in a good location, short walk from the centre, nice and helpful staff. The Rooms are outdate and in dire need of update, carpets were dirty, desk chair was old and tired, arm ripped and it would not hold it´s position. The room was dirty and could have used better cleaning. Check out made us loose our train into London as the nightshift had refunded my payment and I was charged again in the morning. But helpful manager sorted it out but it took a bit of time."

All the food was barely warm and made worse with thick cold plates. Example _ eggs fried and left to get cold for ages, scrambled eggs over cooked and almost cold ,along with everything else, no where near worth the money. Try eating a breakfast at 8.30 am and see if you agree"

1692,Stuartvilla,2021-10-24,2.0,"Poor sleep on first of 2 nights. We went as to run a race the first of our two mornings. However very disturbed sleep on our first of two nights. TV in the next room was on full volume on our return at 11 pm. Could never sleep through this, after 3 hours at 2 AM I phoned reception who then came quickly. They entered the room 436 and muted the TV. Ruined our rest and our run was nothing like we thought it would be,due to lack of sleep. Everything else was great,but the main reason for our stay was to have a goodnight sleep for our run. Room 434 was very nice, but why no porter to check floors? it was obvious to us in the corridor that TV was way too loud. Why do TVs need such loud volume in a hotel? A real shame as many lovely things to say of the hotel but our memories are all about our lack of sleep. Alter maximum volume on TVs maybe then this could never have happened."

The TV was almost useless in our room, poor signal and very few channels with no TV guide or info. Quite disappointing for an expensive room. There are minimal facilities but this is understandable given the location and size."

1696,Mae,2021-10-13,3.0,Pleasant It was clean and accessible. At night I can hear pipes or some noise that sound like water or someone running a bath or something. It went on all evening and I’m a light sleeper so I count sleep. That’s a big deal for me.
1697,Taylor,2021-10-11,2.0,"Kinda like a one night stand, alright for a one off but wouldn't go again Close walk to the city centre. First off I put in my notes that we were celebrating a birthday weekend and if they could make it special, they replied saying they have put it in their notes. Absolutely nothing on arrival. Also paying for parking on site is a massive downfall to the location."

1699,Bea,2021-10-07,2.5,"This hotel does not deserve your custom . The room was a standard size, and the bathroom had a good shower with good hot water. The room had a good wardrobe and storage space, which is a rarity. Breakfast, which I paid for includes in the price, was really good, including plant based options. The hotel restaurant had reasonable food. Small portions and some unreasonably expensive but others a good value for money. Restaurant/breakfast staff were really nice. The hotel fitness room was small and rather basic (i.e no barbells). The hotel is 10 mins from the train station and 10mins from the city centre. Although on a busy road I didn't find the room noisy, although truth be said I never have trouble sleeping! The hotel has a ""no housekeeping "" policy at the moment. This meant I had to take my dirty mugs to reception and ask for clean mugs, my room was not hoovered during my stay, let alone the rest of the room tidied. To suggest this is because of ""COVID safety measures"" is an insult to your customers, considering that all the staff (including and particularly the housekeeping staff) are about their business without wearing masks and that there is no contact between the housekeeping staff and the guest during housekeeping. This is blunt cost cutting disguised as a COVID measure. When I challenged reception about this I was told that I had been misinformed (despite the fact I was given a written notice specifying no housekeeping will be done) housekeeping was available if booked the evening before...I don't know, perhaps the virus takes exception when it's told someone will do the room in advance? I'm not sure whether I'm more crosses about the lack of service or the insult of the hotel trying to pretend it's about COVID. And of course no harm will happen to me for not having housekeeping for a few days, but if I pay for a hotel it's because I want that extra pampering, otherwise, I book an Airbnb which is cheaper and where I do my own hoovering and pot washing. This hotel does not deserve your custom and your hard earned cash."
1700,Julie,2021-10-03,5.0,"Good location, very clean. Excellent wifi The hotel was very well located, 5 mins walk from Temple Meads station and right in the city. The staff were very helpful providing us with extra toiletries on request and arranging a taxi to the airport for us. The room was very comfortable and clean and quiet despite being on a main road. The wifi was excellent. Lovely shower and heated mirror that cleared instantly. Good hairdryer, iron and ironing board in room. Very impressed - will stay there again"
1701,Jonathan,2021-09-29,2.5,Passable Location good For the price the room was very small. Mid week meal at home was far better than the supposed chef at work for the evening meal. Breakfast okay but cold. Not value for money in my experience and wouldn’t stay at a Hilton again. Very over rated.

Much better value for nicer hotels can be found in city centre Location to Bristol city centre and friendliness and helpfulness of the staff Value is terrible. Nearly 200 euros (not including breakfast) for 1 night given how utilitarian the hotel is. It is not a pretty hotel. I stayed in the Leonardo Hotel across the road during the same weekend for less than half the price, which is a lot more luxurious, larger bedroom and bathroom."

Little desk to be able to work too and easy to regulate the temperature of the room to stay cool. Cannot fault any part of it, very much a thumbs up from me."
1720,Jose,2021-09-01,1.5,"Please avoid - Waffle machine for breakfast Did feel COVID-unfriendly as there was someone self-isolating in the room just in front of us and every time we entered or left our room there were leftovers in the hallway: trash, food plates, you name it. I'm unsure if that person had tested positive or not, but surely if halfway through their stay they test positive the risks for other guests is quite high? Especially given that they were allowed to receive things outside of their room door by their friends/family/whomever and we even saw the self-isolating person inside the room with an open door chatting to the person that had just brought them something. Other things that made the stay subpar: - Not in the city centre - Bathroom was *extremely* small. Two people cannot stand up in that bathroom unless one of them is inside the shower. - Ceiling painting in the bathroom was peeling off - Paid extra for garden views. The views were quite limited, and I would definitely not call that a garden - Waiters at breakfast were quite pushy to take our plates away even mid-eating. It even happened twice that they only asked if it was ok to pick our plates AFTER they had actually picked them up - 99% sure that the 'pain au chocolat' they offer for breakfast is the DIY you can buy at the supermarket were you put two cylinders of chocolate inside the dough and then oven it for 20 mins."

The location was ideal and walking distance to everything. I would advise to park at the Bristol Temple Quarter car park near the train station because the hotel car park was full. The restaurant manager is great and super friendly. All was great"
1723,Shellane,2021-08-30,3.0,"An okay week but could have been better. Good location, close to family and destination of occasion for travel. Very nice and quiet area, really nice staff. Easy walk into city Centre and shopping mall. Close to beautiful sights and a few good restaurants too. It would have been nice if at least breakfast was included in the price. Cost for parking is ridiculous with no consideration to the amount already paid for room. Not all buttons worked on the remote control, did not even have access to the tv guide.It being Civid times and house keeping not cleaning rooms while people are staying, supplying enough tea, coffee, toilet rolls and such for the time staying would be more convenient than having to ask each time we run out."

1727,Hannah,2021-08-27,2.0,"Wouldn't recommend, unclean and loud Location was great Room wasnt very clean, hairs everywhere, bathroom/shower unclean with marks - would be disappointed with this normally, let alone during the pandemic. We had stayed at this same hotel last September and we enjoyed our stay then with no cleanliness issues, but we were really disappointed this time. Air conditioning unit was also very loud, too loud for sleeping. We switched it off part way through the night but then it had a bright green flashing light when switched off which also wasn't ideal for sleeping. Parking is very expensive, even for the area. Breakfast was overcooked. Overall wouldn't recommend."
1728,Brian,2021-08-26,2.5,"Passable It was in close proximity to train station and city centre. Also, was clean. I had upgraded to a King-size room. However, it transpired upon my asking questions to reception, that the upgrade, was just the bed size, not the room size. The bathroom was very small and compact, in fact, I could touch both sides with my arms outstretched, and the King-size bed, made the main room feel even smaller! Also, car parking at £16 a day was expensive."
1729,Stacey,2021-08-24,2.5,It was ok. I did have higher expectations of the Hilton brand which unfortunately were not met The location of the hotel was good Parking was quite pricey. When I checked in I informed staff I would be keeping my car in the car park my whole stay and was told this was not going to be an issue. While out one day. I received a call from a member of staff asking me to move my car as there were tree surgeons in the car park. I said I could not as I was out and asked why I was not informed the night before. I received quite a rude response from the member of staff and raised it with reception on my return. While I received an apology it did not take away from how I felt.

It was good size TV on the room and also that there was an iron and ironing board provided in the room was something.which no other hotels I have experienced before have ever provided. . Based on where there was no room service provided whilst there it would of been better if there was a bit more coffee and tea sachets provided on the room to last longer for the period as there was no room service to top them up through out the time there .

Check-in slightly delayed but would appear to have been a booking.com issue but soon resolved and we were in the room. We had a Queen room, nice view, very clean and tidy and the air con was nice and cool! We had a few drinks sat outside in the sun and were served superbly by Leonardo and Carla, very attentive, always looking if we needed another drink and were super quick in getting drinks as well. Leonardo has a cracking sense of humour and made the stay complete! We will be staying here again 5* Nothing, this hotel is excellent!"

1752,Emma,2021-07-28,5.0,"Great location The hotel is 7 mins walk from the station and about 15 mins from the shopping centre. The staff are super friendly and welcoming. As someone who doesn’t look well off (and I’m not!), Hilton’s are quite fancy for me so I was worried that I may get judged as I have in some places but nope, super friendly staff and they told me about their Hilton Honors programme so I could check in early (I arrived 3 hours before check in). I would highly recommend the hotel. The location is perfect (it’s next to a small park too), the staff are nice, room is clean, bed is comfy! I arrived at breakfast 30 mins after they opened and the “hot” food was a little cold. They are kept warmed but was surprised at how cold it was considering I wasn’t there much after opening. But saying this, there is a decent amount of choices, hot food (eggs, sausages - everything for a fry up. Waffle maker, toast, yoghurt, fruit, pastries, cereal. There is also lots of drink options (coffee machine with takeaway cups), juices and water. Also (not the end of the world), but the TV didn’t have many channels but was told there would be cable TV. Also couldn’t access the TV guide so had to flick through to see what is on. It would have been helpful to have a note on channels and also how to order room service (and a menu). Overall, these cons are very minor but would be nice as improvement. I would still stay here again."

The hotel is adjacent to our offices in Bristol and is my preferred location for its location, facilities and parking. The staff were outstanding from the moment I arrived till my departure. I specifically applaud the chef and restaurant staff at breakfast. As ever, all the reception and front of house staff were welcoming, unfailingly courteous and patient.. The team exceeded expectations. Nothing could be better it was excellent, and a delightful return to one of my favourite business hotels."

1798,Kirsty,2021-05-06,2.0,"Disappointing for the money spent The staff were very helpful, and it was great to be able to use the gym (they had a booking system for one person at a time). After staying in other 4* hotels in Bristol's city centre I feel this was not good value for money. The room was smaller than others I had stayed in - which is fine, but the bathroom was TINY. You didn't even have room to dry yourself after a shower! I'm also highly disappointed with the amount I had to pay for parking. For 5 days this essentially cost me an extra £100. There are hotels in Bristol offering free parking so feel ripped off. Food was also disappointing, though I did only have room service on one occasion."

Felt really uncomfortable on arrival from receptionist. Better welcome No masks Screens were up Offer to help with luggage I asked for the best room as I am working on a TV show.

3004,Anna,2024-04-30,4.0,Staff as helpful and pleasant as possible though Given how new the hotel is and the price I was surprised by how worn and dirty some things were.Like seating in restaurent area and chairs in room The shower was backing up the drain. It would be good given the long ramos up to the terminal for an 80 yr old to pull a suitcase for trolleys to be available at the hotelI got one the night before and brought it down - a palaver

The staff are the stand out attribute, clearly great training takes place and the staff were extremely helpful, and a real asset to the hotel. The breakfast could be improved significantly. The dinner menu whilst good variety, the quality of the food has room for improvement. The desk chairs in the room were sticky, I think it’s from the type of material they are made from."
3012,Betty,2024-04-26,3.5,"Our stay helped us to recharge ready for our long drive home. After a long flight during the night, the hotel was much appreciated and the member of staff that greeted us was most helpful and welcoming. Decor of our room and public areas looked dated and tired."

Room was clean and beds comfortamble as well as the bathroom was well equipped. Location of the hotel allowed fast access by walk to the departure hall. Thank you for a good stay. Here only to complain a bit abot the size of the room as there was not a good space between table and bed and not comfortable to sit behingd the table.
3021,Ben,2024-04-21,4.0,"My Stay at Hamption by Hilton Bristol Airport Hotel is very well located being a couple of minutes walk to the terminal. Staff was very friendly and chatty. Glad they had gym facility, can do some workout on the spin bike or treadmill. The air conditioning system wasn't working in the room I was assigned, had to swap rooms and staff was helpful to sort that issue. I didn't find the bed to comfy, didn't sleep well, it felt a bit hard, in my opinion."

I would stay there again Clean, close to the terminal and better facilities than expected The hotel website does not make it clear that food is available in the evening or that there is a bar so we purchased an M&S picnic which wasted some time for us. You could make that more explicit on your website"
3029,Jane,2024-04-19,4.5,"We had a good sleep which was the main purpose for the stay. Very quiet rooms, very comfortable beds and exceptionally clean. The take-away breakfast was poor - very unappetising - but we had no other choice as we had an early departure from the airport."

Extensive selection of breakfast food and good choices of meals / snacks on other menus. Clean, comfortable room facilities. If rooms with baths are available , I prefer a bath and a shower."
3036,William,2024-04-14,4.0,"Good Situation. Room very clean and well appointed. Dinner was good. Poor selection for early risers needing to grab breakfast to go. Only croissants available. Also, room price expensive but balanced by ease of access to airport terminal."
3037,Ruth,2024-04-13,4.5,"Always clean & friendly, great breakfast Clean room, quiet and great breakfast Detour in the rain as rear entrance was closed was not appreciated in the middle of the night with luggage & child in tow!"

3041,Carolyn,2024-04-11,4.5,"Superb All as expected, stayed here numerous times And always had the best service. N/a"
3042,John,2024-04-11,4.5,"Fine. As expected. Friendly staff, comfortable room, good breakfast, perfect location The price is rather high for the quality here. It is within easy walking distance of the terminal, so perhaps worth it, but it seems to me they are milking a captive audience. I f you want to stay at Bristol airport, you have to stay here, and you are paying substantially more than the quality would otherwise demand for that. The biggest other problem is that the parking situation is awful. The parking at Bristol is abysmal, and it would be really helpful if the hotel parking was at least competitive, pricewise. Going away for a three or four day business trip, you really want to be able to park at the hotel and pick up your car their upon return. At the current pricing this is not practical,"

3046,Charlotte,2024-04-09,4.5,"Lovely, helpful staff, clean comfortable rooms and a great breakfast (and waffle irons!) It was nice, modern and the rooms were lovely, clean and high quality. The room was all ready for us to stay so we just came in and went straight to bed, after a long journey. The bed was quite firm, but that’s just personal preference. The air con in the room was a bit noisy, so we ended up switching it off."
3047,Ian,2024-04-09,4.0,Ok Proximity from airport Not enough milk in room

3051,Alessio,2024-04-08,3.5,Perfect for an early-morning flight. Early breakfast (from 4.00 am) is a great idea ! Wifi was quite fast and stable. 4-minutes walk to the Airport is a great advantage. Price was a bit too high.

3054,Alison,2024-04-06,4.0,"Lovely hotel. Great room and breakfast. Parking pricey I liked the helpful staff at reception. The room is very clean. Bedding comfortable. Tea facility good. No complaints at all. The room was also quiet which is very important to me. Great breakfast too. My only complaint is we had to pay £45 for our car park in the hotel, from approximately 10 pm till 6am. I think it’s expensive tbh. Parking overnight was £45 - too expensive"
3055,Catherine,2024-04-06,4.0,"Great location for an overnight stay before your flight Friendly, welcoming staff at reception. Our room was clean and comfortable. Perfect location for an overnight stay before an early morning check in. Breakfast was included."
3056,Leonie,2024-04-06,4.5,"Really good Extremely convenient for airport as on site. Very quiet too. Comfortable beds, lovely linen, pillow a bit hard for me but now I’m being fussy! I think if hadn’t got time or timing didn’t work out ,to have breakfast it would be a bit galling to have no option to not purchase breakfast as included in price."

3059,Dainis,2024-04-05,4.0,"Good but expensive option for connection flight for one night. Really close to airport (by walk 3-5 min under roof, it was raining so it helps). Little gym, but nothing to see around. We stay just for overnight and this was ok. Breakfast could be better for this money (we paid 200 eur per night)."
3060,Sales,2024-04-05,4.0,Very good  Poor Food Selection
3061,Emma,2024-04-04,4.5,"Clean ,comfortable and pleasant Breakfast buffet at 4 in the morning was excellent i I wasn't expecting anything to be open that time,considering we had to be at the the airport at 5 room was clean&comfortable Nothing really but if anything woukd like to see a bit more on the dinner menu as not many options"
3062,Jon,2024-04-04,3.5,"Great staff and location, room lovely and clean. Uncomfortable pillows made for restless night. Staff were lovely. Location is brilliant, food and drink were great. We found the pillows very uncomfortable, so didn’t sleep very well."
3063,Angela,2024-04-04,3.5,"Good value and great location Check in was fast and good, staff gave all info we needed. room was clean and comfortable. beds very comfortable. morning call was offered. breakfast has plenty of options. no shuttle to the terminal if the weather is bad, works affected the pathway to the hotel"
3064,Indigo_01,2024-04-04,4.0,"Very good Stylish, friendly and convenient. Can be a bit noisy still at night due to location."
3065,Hunter,2024-04-03,4.5,Superb Ideal location Friendly and professional staff Would recommend
3066,Chris,2024-04-02,4.5,"Best airport hotel ever 😊 Great location, smart clean rooms and amazing staff! All good 👍"
3067,Lorna,2024-04-02,4.5,an ideal location when travelling from Bristol airport Nice welcome near midnight and a barman still able to let us buy a whisky... After a long day's travelling. A clean and comfortable room with air con/heating that was responsive. Satisfactory breakfast There wasn't anything
3068,Chris,2024-04-02,4.0,Very good Closeness to the airport Finding out that the parking at the hotel was £45 for a night when I was already booked in to the next door multi storey for the following day. I could have just added an extra day to the parking in the multi storey.
3069,Gareth,2024-04-02,3.5,Convenient but facilities poor Location and convenience to terminal The bar options and restaurant menu Seating quality in bar/restaurant
3070,Pauline,2024-04-01,4.5,Superb Rooms good & breakfast good The performance to pay to get a drink at the bar. Seemed crazy bar staff couldn't take payment and had to go to reception to set a tab up. Price for it was a bit steep as well.
3071,Barbara,2024-03-31,3.5,"Great location but painfully expensive for the time I was there. Brand new hotel, nice room, 3 minute walk to airport so perfectly located. The price!!!! You really do have to pay through the nose for the convenience of being right by the airport. But it's not like anyone will be staying for anything other than hours. It would be good if they had a different ptrice structure so that you could rent the room for 12 hours ."
3072,Amber,2024-03-30,4.0,"Friendly staff, clean spacious rooms, clarity on suites needed We loved the checking in experience - Cameron was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious, clean and as expected (we booked adjoining interconnected rooms as a family suite). The only issue was the inability to specify that we wanted one room as a,twin instead of a double. We had hoped to put the children in a twin room but instead had to do one parent one child per double bed, which didn't result in great sleep for anyone."
3073,Lauren,2024-03-30,4.5,"Perfect for before an early flight Cameron who checked us in was professional and polite, had a lovely friendly manner as he chatted to my family. Breakfast had a good selection All okay"
3074,Janet,2024-03-30,4.0,"Easily accessible to the airport, clean and tidy hotel The flight was to early to have breakfast A bit costly"
3075,Barbara,2024-03-30,4.5,Couldn't be better under the circumstances of our travel. Friendly and helpful staff. Easy checking in even though we arrived late. Decent breakfast & comfortable room to fall into when arriving exhausted. Thank you. The common seating area could have been better cleaned.
3076,Brian,2024-03-29,4.5,"Short but sweet. The first time we stayed at this location, very convenient as our arrival was late. We were impressed. The room was very loved the bed and shower. The breakfast was nice. No decaffeinated coffee in the room."
3077,Brownj13,2024-03-29,4.5,"Comfortable, clean and friendly friendly and very central No issues"
3078,Lyn,2024-03-29,4.0,handy for the airport so handy for the airport - we dragged off a late flight into the hotel in minutes to catch up with our sleep. The nightime staff on reception were lovely. we weren't sure whether we could eat late so bought sandwiches in the airport before coming over. breakfast is served until 10 - a little later would be helpful given the comings and goings of people using this type of hotel (& the price)
3079,Carl,2024-03-29,4.0,Very good So close to airport room and food was great
3080,Gary,2024-03-29,4.5,"Excellent location the hotel cleanliness was excellent Location, cleanliness, the room, and food was great. I would certainly use this hotel again. Nothing"
3081,Christopher,2024-03-29,4.5,"Ideal for our purposes would be happy to stay there again if flying from Bristol Airport. Very friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast selection even very early in the morning. The room was clean and had everything we needed for our short stay. Proximity to Bristol airport was ideal. Being unable to pay cash for drinks and food."
3082,Stephanie,2024-03-28,4.5,Ideal for airport Location excellent. Always clean and comfortable. Lovely quality toiletries and spacious shower with shower head not fixed which is great for washing hair without drowning. Varied buffet breakfast. Dinner available in the evening fortunately as nothing else around and fair price at around £15 for a main. Nice wine stocked too 😂 One odd thing. The bathroom sink is set quite far back in its surround. Have to lean quite far in which is a bit uncomfortable. Be nice to have a magnifying mirror if possible one day.
3083,Andrea,2024-03-27,4.5,Well worth taking the stress out of an early flight Perfect
3084,June,2024-03-26,4.5,Comfortable hotel marred by parking charge Disgusting price for parking unexplained in website. Would never book again £60 to park in a hotel car park!!!! Rip off parking could never recommend hotel to others
3085,Peter,2024-03-25,4.0,"very good, convenient, evening meal disappointing room breakfast evening meal"
3086,Robert,2024-03-25,3.5,Convenient stay when flying Very convenient next to the airport when having an early flight. Room was tidy and had everything needed for a one night stay. Quiet and quite comfy beds. The staff at reception the were very pleasant. The breakfast. Ok it is a part of the price you pay when you stay (we paid £154 for one night) but compared to other hotels who offer this I would expect a bit better quality when paying that amount per night. Everything seemed very unhealthily greasy especially the hash browns!
3087,Paul,2024-03-23,4.0,Very good Proximity to terminal. All good. The bed
3088,Sean,2024-03-23,4.5,"Very relaxing - perfect way to start our holiday Room was quiet, bed very comfortable. Did not have breakfast due to early flight, but had a drink and meal in the bar the previous evening. Drinks and meals were lovely."
3089,James,2024-03-22,4.5,"Superb Strategic position, very friendly staff and spacious room with everything you may need. Quite expensive obviously because it’s literally next to the terminal. What I found ridiculous is the 45 £ parking fee for a hotel guest that arrives at 21.00 and leaves at 08.00. That is a total rip-off, the rest is fair overall, including the restaurant and bar (not bad at all)"
3090,Sharon,2024-03-22,3.5,Good WE had an early flight so it took the pressure off in the morning as it's a short walk through to the terminal. Basic but good. Food was OK so it was fine for what we needed. Fine for what we needed
3091,Ian,2024-03-22,3.5,"Have been previously, and the price has increased, but not the eating experience. The room was fine. The food was overpriced. Chairs somewhat uncomfortable for eating. Lower prices for the standard received."
3092,Madeleine,2024-03-22,4.0,Very good Location is very convenient for late arrivals/ early departures. Lovely buffet breakfast A little pricey. The receptionist told us to go to the short stay carpark to get an Uber but Uber told us that we could have waited in the warm hotel as they come in and validate the hotel car park ticket :(
3093,Boothman,2024-03-21,3.5,Good We liked the proximity to the airport. Drinks were reasonable prices and good quality drinks. Very friendly staff. Carole and the younger lad behind the bar. Sorry I didn't catch your name. We had a wake up call too as we had an early flight. Also breakfast was served from 4 am which was perfect to grab some coffee before we left. The bar / lounge area wasn't very warm. The food wasn't the best. I only had a toasted sandwich.
3094,Amy,2024-03-21,4.5,Easy airport access perfect for young families Perfect location to stay with our toddler before an earlier flight. Breakfast was easy to access and staff were brilliant.
3095,Mary,2024-03-20,4.0,"Very good Location , comfortable bed, good shower , well maintained,service was efficient and it ticked all the boxes for catering."
3096,Louise,2024-03-20,4.0,"Comfortable hotel to stay in if arriving late, or leaving from the airport early. The location next to the airport was very convenient. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The toom was totally silent so the soundproofing was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The noticeboard for the flights was very useful. The television had no access to Netflix or other apps which was a bit frustrating. The reception and dining area felt chilly, and the decor was too grey and uniform."
3097,Burdett,2024-03-19,4.0,Very good Close to airport. Breakfast was good. Room was ideal. Cost of parking
3098,Perkins,2024-03-19,4.0,Excellent The staff were very friendly Nothing came to mind
3099,Alessandra,2024-03-18,4.0,This is a very good location near the airport I liked the croissants and coffee
3100,Colin,2024-03-18,4.0,"Very good Well designed and comfortable room, bed and shower room. Close to the airport so very convenient for our trip to and from Málaga The lunchtime food menu was not good and very little choice for people with allergies. Very expensive also."
3101,Ian,2024-03-18,4.5,Superb Location Breakfast Room
3102,Suzanne,2024-03-18,4.0,Very good  Unable to open a window due to building work
3103,Josephine,2024-03-18,4.0,"First stay, so pleased with the location and accommodation. Clean, modern, comfortable bed, lovely bathroom. Very short, easy walk from departures/arrivals Nothing, perfect for an airport stay"
3104,Kelly,2024-03-17,3.5,"Good Staff very friendly with my daughter Food was awful, cheesy chips must of been done in a microwave they were all congealed together, daughter had mac and cheese that had grease running off it"
3105,Caroline,2024-03-17,4.5,Airport stopover Perfect location for overnight stay at airport
3106,Brian,2024-03-16,4.0,"Have stayed a few times now and always find it comfortable and qiet in roowish we could book direct. Liked room, staff, breakfast. Usually get better price NOT booking direct. Would like better choice for meals and perhaps better presented. Walk from Terminal so far at present (realise the building going on) especially at our age (Seniors) but got assistance to Terminal when leaving."
3107,Bethaney,2024-03-15,3.5,"Lovely rooms - eat before you arrive Lovely room, nice clean and comfortable. The staff member who checked us in was lovely. Very close to the airport making it very easy for our 7am flight, expensive for a nights stay however for the convenience it was worth the price. The food. Very expensive poor quality food, had I known it would be the case we probably would have eaten before arrival. £40 for 2 Pepsis, 1 panini and a very tasteless chicken korma. I wouldn’t mind the price had the food been good. The young girl on the bar I dealt with was also quite rude, when I asked if I could pay cash she literally laughed in my face and said “there’s literally a sign right there that says card only” pointing at it. The smallest printed sign on front of the till, no mention of it on the menus. Rooms great, food definitely needs improvement."
3108,Judith,2024-03-15,4.5,"Great hotel and great food We have stayed here since it opened , it has a lovely atmosphere It has gone up in price quite a bit"
3109,Jane,2024-03-15,4.0,Apart from the works - perfect - staying again! Proximity to airport Unfortunately major works meant a walk around the road which lugging a heavy case was not ideal. Still not far but not ideal when it says its a two minute walk to the airport and in fact maybe six - in the rain!
3110,Michael,2024-03-13,4.0,"Nice accommodation, poor food The location of course, right next to the airport We’ve stayed at this hotel several times and the big thing that lets it down every single time is the poor quality of the food. It really is not good. Considering the price of the hotel, it should be much better."
3111,Ann,2024-03-13,3.5,Very convenient and glad of early breakfast Location for airport was reason for booking Bath in room
3112,Margaret,2024-03-13,4.5,Excellent location for flights with very nice clean and comfortable rooms Clean - location - excellent bed - very nice bathroom - staff were helpful The breakfast breads could be a bit more varied. It’s a solid but not exciting breakfast
3113,Kim,2024-03-12,4.0,"Would recommend. Had very early flight, so convenient. Very comfortable and easy check-in/out. There is no undercover walkway and it was raining, arriving and leaving!"
3114,Duane,2024-03-12,4.5,Superb easy walk to airport price
3115,Ian,2024-03-12,4.0,Pretty well as expected Most of it Supper
3116,Lorraine,2024-03-11,4.0,Very good Good hotel and team Dragging bags around due to airport works
3117,Ann,2024-03-11,3.5,Very convenient for airport not sure if I’d stay Convenient location. Nice rooms Check in took nearly an hour even with a booking confirmation and was very a stressful process. Staff were quite vacant and service was extremely slow even though it was not that busy. Rooms were very nice but reception area was like a departure lounge. Strange post office style queuing system by the bar. Very expensive.
3118,Jacqueline,2024-03-10,4.0,Room styling exceeded expectations. Shower excellent. Lots of pillows. Location good. Would have preferred muesli to cornflakes. Cereal selection
3119,Matthew,2024-03-10,4.5,A perfect way to start your holiday. Very close to terminal; clean and comfortable. And no aircraft noise. Exceptionally clean. Very helpful and friendly staff. Maybe a packet of biscuits on the room would be nice.
3120,Alan,2024-03-10,3.5,"Complete the covered walk to the terminal and this would be great improvement on a very nice hotel. Very comfortable room, cleanliness excellent, staff friendly and helpfull, although some of the reception staff seemed a little inexperienced. Location very good. Meals (breakfast and dinner) satisfactory. The sliding door on the toilet/shower room (there would have been room for a conventional hinged door). On opening the door to the toilet, it covered the wardrobe access. A big problem was the lack of a full covered walkway to the airport terminal. Only about one third was covered and we were soaked after the 2-3 minute walk."
3121,Gillian,2024-03-10,4.0,Would book again Free breakfast was good. Sadly on the outward journey early banging from building works
3122,Philip,2024-03-09,3.5,Good Checked in and was given a key to a room already occupied. Complained and got a free dinner. Went to the bar later and paid £15!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for a large scotch. The price of a large scotch
3123,Helen,2024-03-09,4.0,"Very handy for the terminal building Convenient, clean & good facilities Expensive"
3124,Ian,2024-03-09,3.5,Good Excellent and friendly staff Evening meals are basic but that's probably fine for an airport hotel.
3125,Barbara,2024-03-08,4.0,Good location Location Long walk from the hotel to the airport pushing a heavy suitcase. Please install a more direct route so people do not have to walk all the way around the car park.
3126,Roy,2024-03-07,4.0,Overall very good. Room Staff Shower drain seemed to be partially blocked
3127,Svitlana,2024-03-06,4.0,Comfortable and quiet hotel in convenient location Despite being so close to the airport it was very quiet in the room . Comfortable beds so had a good few hours sleep before our flight . Early breakfast . A bit pricey for one night stay .
3128,Nick,2024-03-06,3.5,Good Location Cooked breakfast is poor quality
3129,J,2024-03-06,4.5,Good and would use this hotel again when next in Bristol Great Location and lovely room Nothing
3130,Ann,2024-03-05,4.0,"Comfortable overnight stay in perfect airport location Location, comfort, and professional and friendly staff. Breakfast - vegetarian sausages were horrible. Linda McCartney or Richmond meatless sausages are far superior and inexpensive. No soya milk."
3131,Margaret,2024-03-05,4.5,Very comfortable well located hotel. Well situated for early morning start. Modern well equipped comfortable room Bit pricey
3132,Ian,2024-03-04,4.5,Superb Breakfast Room Atmosphere in bar Proximity to Bristol Airport terminal building
3133,Ruth,2024-03-04,4.0,Very good Convenience to departures. Nice breakfast from very early. Clean quiet room Nil
3134,Byron,2024-03-04,4.0,Value for money hotel located close to airport Hotel was very clean and all staff I spoke with professional & friendly Due to the on going building works the walk to the hotel from airport following the directions along the road was much longer than expected and would suggest difficult for older travellers. Cash not being excepted to pay for food and drinks was a surprise.
3135,Blin,2024-03-03,4.0,Very good all
3136,Andrea,2024-03-03,3.5,Good location Location for airport. Asked for a lower room as don't use lifts and was offered an easy access room. The room turned out to be a fully disabled room which had a very clinical smell and having stayed here before was not up to the normal standard. Arrived late and decided to have a drink in the bar but sadly none of the tables had been cleaned. The staff were removing glasses from tables and leaving notices on them asking people to bear with them until they wiped the tables Couldn't really understand why this couldn't be done at the time of clearing
3137,Lisa,2024-03-03,4.5,Really good. Proximity to airport. Comfortable Good facilities The bar seemed slow and badly organised
3138,Jan,2024-03-02,3.5,Ok Close to airport Very poor menu
3139,Maria,2024-03-02,3.5,Ok Its convenient for the airport Price a bit high. And a glass of wine is costly
3140,Angela,2024-02-29,4.0,Very good On the airport. Decent breakfast. Staff helpful and friendly. Bed quite hard. Room was cold on arrival and heating had been turned up high to get it warm but then would be too hot - the temperature on the thermostat did not seem to be working properly. Shower not very hot.
3141,Jill,2024-02-29,4.5,Ok Location Restaurant?
3142,John,2024-02-29,4.0,Ok Modern and clean Uncovered access from airport to hotel
3143,Peter,2024-02-28,4.0,Good for travellers using the airport Early breakfast from 4am with hot breakfast from 6pm. Limited choice of menu for evening meal. Thought hotel price was a bit high.
3144,Neal,2024-02-27,4.5,"Brilliant airport location Excellent stop over for flight from Bristol. Continental breakfast was fine for a very early flight. Very quiet, clean and comfortable. Staff very helpful."
3145,Julia,2024-02-27,4.5,Great peace of mind & relaxing start when taking an early flight. Great choice of breakfast at very early time With the problem of access to hotel currently limited to door from carpark only. When you have a heavy suitcase & you are over 65 there should be some sort of shuttle offered to reach airport . It’s a steeper & longer climb than from the front door.
3146,Beverley,2024-02-26,4.0,Breakfast fruit was off. Surfaces in the bedroom had not been wiped properly. Staff were excellent. Still feels new. Reasonably well maintained. Location
3147,Aneeta,2024-02-26,4.5,Fab stay as rooms were great. Great beds and pillows were comfortable. Food was great and beds were super comfortable.
3148,Sarah,2024-02-25,4.0,"Very pleasant airport hotel Staff were extremely helpful, very comfortable generally, Breakfast was good and it was all surprisingly nice for an airport hotel. Evening food prices were reasonable. Evening food was ok but not oustanding."
3149,Rosalind,2024-02-25,4.0,Served the purpose after a late flight arrival Convenience; quiet
3150,Paul,2024-02-25,4.0,"Friendly staff, clean room and good breakfast Breakfast was excellent. Only having one comfy chair in the bedroom"
3151,Michael,2024-02-25,4.5,Convenient (usually) and comfortable Everything No shuttle service to the airport terminal which is more important during the building works as the walkway is closed. Took us 20minutes pushing 3 suitcases up a long hill in the rain at 4am
3152,Gerard,2024-02-24,4.5,Clean comfortable hotel close to airport. Staff very attentive. Close to airport
3153,Ana,2024-02-23,4.0,Very good It is just next to the terminal !! Very handy !! Very comfy travelling with children !!!
3154,Chris,2024-02-23,4.0,"Great for early starts at the airport! Friendly staff, great location and quiet rooms despite proximity to the airport Food selection was fairly limited, and also a little utilitarian"
3155,Katherine,2024-02-23,4.5,"The best option for overnight at Bristol airports Easy to reach from the airport, very clean and well equipped room ."
3156,Sandra,2024-02-22,3.5,Good Convenient for airport. Evening food was not good with a very processed limited menu.
3157,Andrew,2024-02-22,3.5,Easy access to airport Easy access to airport Lucily we had parking already in the Airport as it was £55 per night at the hotel Road works made access not so easy
3158,Richard,2024-02-22,4.0,Very good Ideal for early morning flight A long walk due to building work around hotel
3159,Vicki,2024-02-21,4.0,Very good Location Very cold
3160,Eileen,2024-02-21,4.0,Early flight so good to have a nice room and breakfast. Good sized room Bathroom door did not close properly.
3161,Tracey,2024-02-21,4.0,Great location for the airport but disappointed at the additional parking charges The location The outrageous parking charge!
3162,Debbie,2024-02-21,4.5,Perfect Perfect location for travelling from the airport Nothing
3163,Jon,2024-02-21,4.0,Convenient and suitable for a short rest between flights Quiet and comfortable room
3164,Merilyn,2024-02-21,4.5,"So so convenient for an early bird flight. I travel to Jerez de la Frontera regularly to do flamenco classes with teachers there. Not exactly leisure nor work. It’s a long journey and to save time and money I invariable catch a very early flight. I can then travel on from Malaga to Seville and then Jerez. The hotel stay makes that possible and I can leave the car in the Silvee parking and go to bed in comfort. The breakfast in the morning is a bit grundgy - but I do have a particular diet (no dairy milk, no factory bread, only organic). It is included with the price though. This time we had to take a long detour walking to avoid building work. Never mind all wirth it. The staff are great. The rooms excellent."
3165,Stroud,2024-02-21,4.0,"Overall worth booking if you’ve got an early flight. Good facilities and no noise considering so close to airport. Very clean, great staff. Convenient for airport Quite expensive."
3166,Kim,2024-02-20,4.0,On the whole ok for one night breakfast was very good Very clean and beds very comfortable Very disappointed with the evening meal from restaurant. Jacket potato was rotten on the inside on one meal and lettuce stale and brown on the other meal both had to be sent back and changed
3167,Mike,2024-02-20,4.5,Superb Location and modern styling of the decor
3168,Kerry,2024-02-20,3.5,Convenient for Bristol Airport. This is a convenient hotel for the airport. The rooms were good. They were quiet and the beds were comfy. The shower was good. Handy to get food and drinks in the hotel. Free breakfast. It will be better when the building work is completed so you're closer to the airport and don't have the slope. It is quite expensive. We didn't get breakfast as were leaving extremely early so would prefer to not have to pay for it.
3169,David,2024-02-20,4.5,Superb Very comfortable room breakfast was excellent for early departure of our flight Not really anything
3170,Julie,2024-02-20,4.0,Great value with complimentary breakfast Excellent proximity to the airport Not the hotels fault but building work being done started at 8am so early wake up call after a late flight
3171,Sutherland,2024-02-19,4.0,"Comfortable, good breakfast. Clean and comfortable Expensive for what it is, not great value for money. Probably because it’s near an airport"

3174,Andrew,2024-02-19,4.0,"A lot of money for a couple of hours sleep.otherwise excellent location and staff Location Parking Technology failed getting in and out, had to sit and wait. Had to pay for breakfast, we were unable to have due to flight time. There should have been a reduction. We got drenched getting to airport as walk way closed, not sure why, from hotel to other carport did not effect hotel."
3175,Patricia,2024-02-18,4.5,"Great. Will stay again. Location, breakfast starts at 4am this is perfect. Great facilities. 5 minutes walking distance from airport. Staff not very friendly."

3177,Stephen,2024-02-18,4.5,"Great location and friendly staff, comfortable quiet room. Really like this hotel, great location and really good staff - friendly and helpful. Nice, quiet room, comfortable bed, slept well. The dinner food was not very good and expensive for what it was. We got absolutely soaked walking round the pedestrian diversion around the work on the extension."
3178,Andrew,2024-02-18,4.5,Would stay again Access to airport Expensive for one night no pRking

3186,Annette,2024-02-15,4.0,"convenient, easy convenience second bed was sofa bed"
3187,Paul,2024-02-14,4.5,Excellent location Location and ease of getting breakfast. Nothing
3188,Victor,2024-02-14,4.0,Good location nice hotel Location and nice room The entrance from the bus was closed so I had to walk completely around the hotel. Also could not get a VAT receipt even though Booking. Com said air could get a receipt if I asked for it at reception. Reception said they could not issue one and I had to ask Bookjng.com
3189,Alfred,2024-02-14,4.0,"A lovely stay in a very comfortable and convenient hotel Breakfast and previous evening meal were excellent. Room nice as was the ensuite Location slightly spoiled by the sink hole closing the shortcut to / from the airport - particularly Shan I walked the long detour to the hotel, in the dark,not knowing where I was going. It was both tiring and a little scary. Had I known beforehand - eg by text - then I could have planned"
3190,Andrea,2024-02-13,4.0,"Clean and comfortable, will use again. Clean and comfortable, staff were friendly Bit of a palaver getting into airport with the building works that are happening, I am not very mobile so it was a bit of a slog. Very long hair on one of the plates our food came on."
3191,Chris,2024-02-13,3.5,Great for convenience It was conveniently situated Its facilities were typical of a transit hotel
3192,Toby,2024-02-13,4.5,Superb Great hotel when making an eaeyl flight or arriving home late. It's just outside the terminal. The footpath was closed this stay so had a walk around the car park to get to terminal but not a big issue.
3193,Heather,2024-02-12,3.5,Good 2 large single beds with generous duvets. Toiletries provided. Self service breakfast ok. Room was cool and heating did not help. Only 1 hook in bathroom for clothes or damp bath towels. Construction work going on outside the wing we were in. Drilling started at 8am
3194,Susan,2024-02-12,4.0,Very good Breakfast Room was freezing when we arrived. Took us a couple of hours to warm up
3195,Cazzaj16,2024-02-12,4.5,Superb Staff were very friendly on check-in and check-out. Can't hear anything from outside within the rooms so was very quiet (we were not airport side). Breakfast was lovely and bed super clean with a nice mattress Pillows too soft but that's just my preference. Cutlery for breakfast had water stains and hadn't been polished
3196,Christine,2024-02-11,4.0,It was perfect for our necessity to be near to the airport Convenient
3197,Leanne,2024-02-11,3.5,Good Lovely and clean That’s the side entrance was closed and we had to walk all the way around in the pouring down rain was soaked when we got to airport would have been nice to be told this
3198,Anne,2024-02-11,4.0,"Very good Convenient, clean and spacious. Lovely bedroom and bathroom. It was all good"
3199,Geogiana,2024-02-10,4.5,"Great hotel, great location, best hotel to start a holiday, definitely recommend it Location, cleanliness, staff, services The sofa bed was not perfectly comfortable"
3200,Esmé,2024-02-09,4.5,Superb Convenient for early morning flight check-in. No warning that hotel footpath was deviated from the terminal due to ongoing works and in pouring rain arrived wet and with wet luggage.
3201,Carl,2024-02-09,4.0,"Very enjoyable, would definitely recommend to others. Breakfast was very good, evening meal also very good, staff excellent."
3202,Roderick,2024-02-09,3.5,Good Clean comfy bed. Menu choice. Poor access to terminal - use of transport was helpful. Poor ventilation options. AC noisy
3203,Linda,2024-02-08,3.5,"Clean and comfortable, and very close to airport. Good location, within walking distance of the airport All good"
3204,Gwyneth,2024-02-08,4.0,Just ok. Proximity to airport. Breakfast. Complications with reception. Parking charges. Lack of cosy atmosphere.
3205,Sheila,2024-02-08,4.0,A really good place to stay if you have an early flight Proximity to the airport. Helpful staff. Comfortable room. Very good breakfast even at 4am The bar menu food was not great. No/one in our party was really impressed with what they ordered. My cheese sandwich has such a this slice of cheese in it you could barely taste it. Bar area was also a little chilly.
3206,Migueljk,2024-02-08,4.5,Comfortable and relaxing All round great stay. Nothing to dislike
3207,Paul,2024-02-07,4.5,"Excellent choice for stop over before flying out of Bristol Airport or when returning. Well organised and good food for the type of hotel. Dinner ends at 10pm so a bit disappointing if you have a late flight we arrived at just after 10pm and dinner was finished. However, they do offer a room service with a limited menu."
3208,Godelieve,2024-02-07,4.0,"Staying there again for comfort and hope the restaurant will improve Cleanliness, comfort, very comfortable bed and pillows, quiet and a walk away from the terminals The food is not to the standard of the hotel at all. Very disappointing."
3209,Simon,2024-02-07,4.5,"Great way to start your holiday Great location, friendly and helpful team 👍"
3210,Nicola,2024-02-06,4.0,Very good Location Tap water in the toilette smelled funny. I forgot to report to the reception

3216,Anthony,2024-02-04,4.5,"Perfect o/n stop before the flight Very good clean rooms, everything required for o/n stay. Really close to airport, handy. All good"
3217,Julie,2024-02-04,4.0,1 night preflight Clean comfy beds close airport. Food poor qualiity ..room small as i paid extra queen..but more like a double..very expensive overall
3218,Robert,2024-02-02,4.5,"Great location - but park in Silver Zone not in the hotel car park! Excellent location, walking distance from airport Very expensive parking. In the end I parked in Silver Zone 12 hours early and paid them an extra £15 instead of the overnight £45 quoted by the hotel."
3219,Chris,2024-02-01,4.0,It was ok VERY CLOSE TO AIRPORT FOOD WASNT ALL THAT NICE AND IT WAS EXPENSIVE
3220,Paula,2024-02-01,4.5,It was very convenient it was a bit pricey Very close to airport It was cold in our room and thermostat want working
3221,Martin,2024-01-31,4.0,"Clean, comfortable and convenient. I liked the toast in the morning. Bed was comfortable and shower facilities were good. Was expensive for a solo traveller."
3222,Lynne,2024-01-31,4.5,Excellent choice for easy early morning flight. Close proximity to multi storey car park and airport building. One hour free parking for check in and luggage drop. Friendly helpful staff. Good evening meal. Early continental breakfast buffet excellent!
3223,Nigel,2024-01-30,4.5,"all good thanks - just what we needed proximity to the airport good breakfast included direct access from the airport. the access was closed due to ""weather problems""!"
3224,Philip,2024-01-30,4.5,"Convenient and comfortable hotel. Brilliant location for access to terminal buildings. Excellent sound proofing - considering it is at an airport, there was no exterior noise at all."
3225,Samantha,2024-01-30,4.5,Very convenient and while not cheap was worth it for the early start and the staff were very lovely A really big room which was great as we had ski bags and large suitcases. Everything was clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Plus breakfast started at 4.30 so we managed to eat something before our early flight. I didn’t realise it was included in the price! Work by Bristol airport meant we couldn’t walk as easily as usual to the terminal but that was not the hotels fault. Trolleys for luggage would have helped
3226,Angela,2024-01-29,4.0,Very good Very clean - great proximity to airport Nothing
3227,Wendy,2024-01-29,4.5,Definitely stay again. Left too early Small niggles...TV unplugged and socket hidden. No decaf coffee. No non dairy milk in room.

3230,Ceri-ann,2024-01-28,4.5,Superb Good food. Nice and quiet. Walk to the terminal. It was expensive for one night.
3231,Jackie,2024-01-27,3.5,"Good  We had the burger and chips and it's the worst burger I have ever had totally tasteless, shame on you hampton by hilton"

3234,Martin,2024-01-25,4.5,"Superb The bar staff working on the 24th were excellent, polite and efficient, even though they struggled opening a new bottle of rum. The good was served quickly and was just the right amount."
3235,Mary,2024-01-25,3.5,"Last minute booking Last minute booking in airport hotel The bed was very comfortable and a good size. The staff were efficient and welcoming. It was a filthy wet night so understandably wet leaves had been brought in on people's shoes, but they were still there in the morning. No vegan/ vegetarian options for breakfast"
3236,Lynda,2024-01-25,4.0,"Very good Nice clean,polite man on reception, although breakfast was continental was pleased with it Giving me a room that wasn't cleaned and tv chanel were poor for a English hotel when I got the second room was satisfied"
3237,Steve,2024-01-25,4.0,Family night stop over It’s always great to stay here the night before travelling The staff are always amazing And the food and facilities are pretty good also No waffle machine
3238,Sta,2024-01-25,4.0,Quiet & convenient Great location for access to the airport. The room was quiet & clean. Breakfast options were good.
3239,Ray,2024-01-25,3.5,"Served a purpose. Breakfast was well organised and delivered. Nice. Exit to airport terminal closed. Restaurant was disappointing, limited choice, but chosen meal acceptable. Side order forgotten."
3240,Jenny,2024-01-24,4.0,"Absolutely fine and the croissant were really good The hotel is clean and comfortable. Croissant at breakfast were good. The rooms are comfortable. The price I think is high for what is basically a upmarket Premier Inn. However, it is the only hotel by the airport so I can fully appreciate why there is a premium. We chose to pay the price as my husband had an early flight and we wanted to be as close as possible to the airport. We could have stayed at the Clifton Gorge Hotel Du Vin for the same price which would have been much more of a 'special' stay but as we basically just wanted a bed for the night this was fine. It is a hotel that offers what it says it will do. The staff member I dealt with at check-in was very friendly and helpful. Very small thing but I was surprised that there was only standard tea or coffee sachets in the room. I would have liked a green/peppermint/ or something similar before going to bed."
3241,Paul,2024-01-23,4.0,"Very convenient to Bristol airport, excellent location, great facilities and great people. Great location and spotlessly clean Very little to dislike, it was perfect for our overnight stay before travelling on."
3242,Tom,2024-01-22,4.5,Perfect for an early flight. Perfect for an early morning flight Nothing
3243,Marta,2024-01-21,4.5,"Fantastic option if you need to take an early flight The location couldn't be better if you need to take an early flight in the morning. It's right next to the airport. I have stayed in this hotel twice and both times the rooms were very nice and comfortable. I find the price quite expensive, considering that both times I booked was to be able to take an early flight in the morning, so I didn't feel like I had much time to enjoy the rooms or the complimentary breakfast."
3244,Neil,2024-01-21,4.5,"Superb Close to the airport, clean, nice big beds"
3245,James,2024-01-21,4.0,"comfortable and very convenient for airport--walkable. good breakfast, comfortable room, very convenient to airport choice of food in evening not very inspiring."
3246,Raymond,2024-01-21,4.0,Good hotel but as with all airport hotels slightly over priced Great location 5 min walk from terminal Food was very average
3247,Jane,2024-01-20,3.5,"Good hotel, ridiculous overnight car park charge Extremely convenient for early morning flight out of Bristol airport The new car park charge which was an eye watering £45 overnight! Even though we booked before this came in it was still applied. Would not stay there again for this reason"
3248,Martyn,2024-01-19,3.5,"It's ideal to fly. Food fine but self service. Great breakfast. Rather expensive. This is an airport hotel in a great position. Food was fine. It does the job. It was quite expensive because its onsite. You get up and walk to the terminal. Self srevice in an expensive hotel. Got to get up and queue every time yiou or anyone in your party wats another course or drink. It does the job but its not part of the holiday,"
3249,Richard,2024-01-19,4.5,Splendid Very convenient for Bristol Airport Nothing I can think of
3250,Tracey,2024-01-18,3.5,Very convenient for Airport Close to the airport Ideal for early flight Staff very friendly and helpful Had lots of puzzles and books with crayons for children which was great as I was with my 2 year old granddaughter Arrived at 7pm Really busy in the restaurant seemed short staffed and lots of food not available So had to settle for a pizza
3251,David,2024-01-17,4.0,Good Ok Facility outside the Hotel getting to the airport
3252,Michelle,2024-01-17,4.5,Superb very helpful lady on reception - apologies i didn't get her name
3253,Clive,2024-01-16,4.0,"Very good Breakfast good but would have liked hot option, we were too early.needed h Needed hot option for breakfast the only thing we were unhappy with but it would not stop us staying again.convenient for flight comfortable room ."
3254,Yvonne,2024-01-15,4.0,"Very good  Could do with better parking facilities, perhaps the option to leave and pick up on return if on the same day"
3255,Shepherd,2024-01-15,4.0,"Very good Location to airport, clean and comfy Too expensive room rate , no fried eggs at breakfast"
3256,Merilyn,2024-01-15,4.5,Decent food and very convenient for air travel. It is SO convenient for early flights from Bristol airport.
3257,Michelle,2024-01-15,4.0,Lovely stay nice staff We were going in our honeymoon the next day so the location is very good also staff were very friendly gave us a drink vouchers because we were on our honeymoon Al thou the food was ok think there could be more choice
3258,Alison,2024-01-14,4.0,"Overall good, staff a little inexperienced and offish upon first communication Location Nothing"
3259,Ian,2024-01-14,4.5,"Ian's stay at Hampton. The hotel was conveniently situated next to the airport, for an early flight to Paris. The shower and bathroom were excellent, and the bedroom was very comfortable. Nothing to report."
3260,Saj,2024-01-14,4.0,Staff were friendly and polite. We cannot fault them. Hotel was clean & tidy. I just felt it was all about the money The property was clean & tidy. I felt it was all about the money e.g when I ordered a glass of Prosecco and they took their time because they had to do the exact measurement for it.
3261,Niall,2024-01-13,4.0,"Very good Very convenient to the airport Very expensive parking. Not the hotels fault, I believe the rate is set by the Airport"
3262,Gary,2024-01-13,4.0,Ok Location Staff not attentive

3266,Gary,2024-01-11,4.0,Very good  Evening meal could have been so much better
3267,Christine,2024-01-11,4.5,Lovely hotel and friendly staff but rooms could have been warmer as it was a very cold night Good breakfast The duvet was too thin. It was a very cold night
3268,Maria,2024-01-11,4.0,"Pleasant and convenient Convenient location, clean and accessible. Good breakfast choices. Lunch and evening meal menus are pretty basic and are like heated up prepared meals rather than fresh cooked."
3269,Pearce,2024-01-10,3.5,Good The staff extremely helpful as I had a bad knee gave me a room on lower floor and brought drinks to my table first class. Ever time door leading out to airport opened draught was tiresome when eating. Sorry to say as a ex chef burger was awful dry bun not toasted a crime really shame as menu in my opinion wants living up not one fish dish and to many curries.
3270,Andrew,2024-01-10,4.0,I would use a different airport to avoid being taken advantage of due to the lack of competition in Only a 5 minute walk to the terminal. Food was good but drinks were excessively expensive. Just profiteering. Shame on you!
3271,Vix73,2024-01-09,4.5,"For one night only Location, food was good. Staff were helpful, polite and friendly. The fact that the hotel did not offer free parking for guests who are staying overnight."
3272,Susan,2024-01-09,4.0,Very good Excellent location for flying from the airport. Nice cooked breakfast.
3273,Revey,2024-01-09,4.5,. So glad we booked this part of our journey A safe evening chill before an early morning flight Couldn’t access the heating/air conditioning. There again we didn’t ask!
3274,Brendan,2024-01-09,4.0,"Ideal for a one night stay pre flight. Location. Walking distance to the airport departure lounge. Clean, safe hotel. It’s a bit bland. The food offering wasn’t great. A bit of a transit feel. Ok for a night but it’s definitely got the one night traveller feel."
3275,David,2024-01-09,4.0,First time using a stay at hotel for an early departure which was good. Quiet and cosy room with comfortable bed. More information about packaged breakfast available for early departure would have been appreciated plus quickest route out to airport.
3276,Roger,2024-01-09,4.0,"Convenient for a stop over. The location right next to the airport, very convenient. It’s a bit soulless.The bar set up was a bit strange. Served our purpose."
3277,Philip,2024-01-09,4.5,"Superb Nbr1 it was next to the Bristol Airport. It was clean and comfortable. Staff were ok. Hit my leg twice on the bedframe! The staff could have been freindlier I think.but over all it was good, the food was fab!!"

3283,Jan,2024-01-06,4.0,A bit expensive for what it is but it’s the best option for an early flight. Excellent location for early flight. It was clean and functional. Nothing to dislike.
3284,Lynne,2024-01-04,3.5,Feel a tiny bit ripped off by breakfast. Breakfast has clearly been cut back itcwas ok but not worth the outlay. Room was good all fine.
3285,Mike,2024-01-04,4.5,"Great place to stay on the way out early or returning later We had an early flight out from the airport the next day, so getting up at 5 am at the hotel was great with leaving two or three hours before this from home. Reception staff were great even had a little breakfast before we left. We would stay there again in the similar circumstances. No problems"
3286,Nicki,2024-01-04,3.5,"Good Comfortable room, great bathroom The breakfast was disappointing."

3290,Lloyd,2023-12-31,4.5,"Superb Every member of staff we encountered were incredibly friendly, helpful and welcoming."
3291,Maria,2023-12-31,4.5,"Very convenient for airport, comfortable and friendly staff. Convenient to airport, nice comfy beds. In my view, the basic lunch and dinner food menu lets the hotel down. Curry ‘special’ tastes like a standard supermarket microwave meal. Food always seems like it is just heated up prepared meals and not cooked from scratch. Ok but basic and not very appetising. Even the menu itself is like a piece of laminated card and does not look very professional. I think an improvement to the above will go a long way to promoting the image of a classier hotel."
3292,Hannah,2023-12-31,4.0,Functional Location next to the airport
3293,Katherine,2023-12-31,4.5,"Excellent receptionist The lady at reception was lovely, very professional and accommodating. Unfortunately I didn't get her name. Parking charge."

3295,Alison,2023-12-30,4.5,"Friendly, comfortable hotel with value for money Spacieux and comfortable room. Staff friendly and efficient. Breakfast varied and delicious."
3296,David,2023-12-29,4.0,Very good Ideal for on airport location with no need for a transfer bus Hotel is low down relative to the departure hall so even with ramps there is a longish haul out in the rain to get into the terminal
3297,Janine,2023-12-29,4.0,"Great stay in great location The staff were very efficient, the hotel was clean and comfortable and the fact that they provided breakfast from 4 am was fantastic for those with an early flight The bed and pillows were very firm"
3298,Jennifer,2023-12-28,3.5,"Ok, what l 3xoect3d. Breakfast very good. Bit of a limited menu for dinner. Couldn't open my window. Always have my bedroom window open at night even if only just a little bit."

3307,Nigel,2023-12-22,3.5,Good Pleasant staffat reception. Overrpriced drinks in bar.
3308,Shaun,2023-12-21,4.0,Very handy so close to airport but overpriced  Internet was very limited access.
3309,Zemir,2023-12-20,3.5,"Good Nice, clean and easy to access from the airport. Arrived a little earlier (before 2pm - which check in time). I was informed to await to 1pm so they will ensure that I can get my room. Came to reception to check in at 1.15pm but suddenly were asked to pay additional fee since I arrived before 2pm (= 20 pounds). Better situation awareness is needed - especially comparing to other Hilton Garden hotel - Birmingham which I stayed same week."
3310,Andrew,2023-12-20,4.5,Good location and facilities Convenient location Not much
3311,Joanna,2023-12-19,4.0,"Nice room, good location but not without issues. The beds are really comfy, rooms spacious and airy. Lovely bathroom. Breakfast was good. The location couldn't have been any better, literally just across the road from the terminal building. We had an issue with our room when we checked in. I won't go into details but the night manager seemed quite mortified by it. The next day we were given a can of pop and a bar of chocolate each by way of an apology. I think given the nature of our complaint and how much we paid for the room, this seemed a little insulting."
3312,Alan,2023-12-17,4.0,"Very good I bought an excellent burger and chips for my evening meal. But more of a choice of a set menu, more formal, evening meal which I would expect from a ""Hilton"" hotel instead of ""fast food"" would have been preferable. Breakfast was good, although the English breakfast could have started a little earlier because of early flights. I could not fault the room, clean and warm and even though just yards from the runway - no noise from aircraft!!! Usually not a hassle to get from the hotel to the departure lounge - but difficult when the site is being upgraded. The only fault I can state is the fact that, even though it was beyond the hotel's control, the area around the departure/arrival terminals were being, so called ""upgraded"". I believe that the hotel could have offered customers a free system for them and their baggage to have been taken to and from the terminals, instead of the 10 - 12 minute convoluted walk, when the walk would usually have taken 2-3 minutes! Wouldn't have been a problem except for the fact it was pouring with rain!! And a taxi for the 500 metre ride was quoted at £15!!!"
3313,Callum,2023-12-15,4.0,Very good The friendly staff and it was easy to walk to and from the airport terminal. Air conditioning was to high making sleep a little uncomfortable.
3314,Olof,2023-12-15,3.5,Convenient Rooom was cold and unheated Being cold in a premium priced property
3315,Rhiannon,2023-12-15,4.5,"Superb Rooms was very clean, very friendly staff and a good variety at breakfast. Family rooms were a bit of a squeeze for 3 people with suitcases."
3316,Jean,2023-12-14,4.0,The room was clean and comfortable and the people behind the desks were very helpful Help getting to the airport The decor is a bit dated and the seating in the bar areas were a bit shabby
3317,Tandy,2023-12-14,3.5,"OK, marred by check in issues! Proximity to the airport. Daisy on reception at check in was very pleasant and professional. Very rude Duty Manager( ?) at Check in. Think she was called Laura/Lauren? She needs to attend/re attend a Customer Services course!! There were some issues with the hotel card terminal not processing Visa Credit Cards and she did not handle it in a courteous or professional manner, unfortunately."
3318,Peter,2023-12-14,3.5,Good Location It's always a little expensive for a very short stay
3319,Almut,2023-12-12,3.5,A good stay in an overpriced hotel The hotel is within a few minutes walk from Bristol Airport. I booked it because of a very late arrival in Bristol. The hotel is overpriced and takes advantage of the only accommodation within easy reach of the airport.
3320,Mary-jane,2023-12-11,3.5,"Good The nearness to Bristol airport terminal The expensive wine, small main meal and poor coffee"
3321,Louise,2023-12-11,4.0,Good location. Download app to make check in quicker Location was good Car park building works made access difficult from main car park. Clearer details of onsite parking would be helpful

3323,Rhianydd,2023-12-10,4.0,"So handy! The staff are really friendly Breakfast is good,plenty of choice Location is perfect, of course The bed wasn't great. Everything my husband turned over,my whole body bounced!"

3325,Pamela,2023-12-09,3.5,"Comfortable but pricey Location perfect for the flight. Room comfortable. Clean. Food while the basic menu was nice. Reception staff were slow. The restaurant staff disorganised, the wine was not cold. For a Hilton expectations were sadly not meet. They have a captive audience."
3326,Michael,2023-12-08,4.0,Short Location Nothing but Premier inn do a proper breakfast and the shower is more powerful and there mattresses are better quality.But as there is no Premier at this location Hampton will have to do
3327,Richard,2023-12-08,3.5,One or two issues but otherwise good Very close to the airport You had to pay for the car park & the barrier for the car park is surrounded by curd stones which have a high lip at the ends& if you approach it from the car park at right angles it catches the car skirt as you have to get close to feed your ticket into the machine All under the same post code as the airport so if you are unfamiliar with the area it's awkward to find
3328,James,2023-12-07,4.0,"Great location, clean room but your paying for over the odds. The location is great The food was very average. And the price is high! It’s a fancy travel in at best."
3329,Pauline,2023-12-07,4.5,Great overnight stay after a long flight Staff friendly and helpful breakfast good room comfortable and quiet: Nothing
3330,Paul,2023-12-06,4.5,Perfect for our flight time (08.45) Was at airport for our flight We came down for breakfast at 6am when it starts and full English was Luke warm at best
3331,Cheryl,2023-12-04,4.5,Good comfortable accommodation. Comfortable beds and room. Location in airport grounds. Friendly staff. Good breakfast included. Bit pricey but airport hotels usually are due to location.

3335,Carol,2023-12-01,4.5,Good once we found how to get to it. Convenient to airport The pathway to the hotel from the airport was dreadful. The surface was bad for suitcase wheels and the signage was haphazard.
3336,Beverly,2023-12-01,4.5,Superb  Not having trolleys available to take multiple cases to airport. Had to walk to airport to find some and then bring them back to load up. No sound on TV BBC1
3337,Elaine,2023-12-01,4.5,"Great location for an early flight, but you pay a premium for the location Excellent location for an early flight at Bristol Airport. Room clean, well equipped, comfortable and quiet. Early breakfast available at 4am. Friendly staff. Expensive"

3339,Cat,2023-11-30,3.5,"Excellent location and ok stay Location excellent and staff very nice Cleanliness wasn’t great- hairs in the bed etc and it was expensive for what it was, even if location was great"
3340,Kevin,2023-11-29,3.5,"My review It was comfortable and clean, and the staff were friendly. The car park should be free for guests, the fact it's airport property is a you problem not a me problem and charging excessive fees for parking makes you look very bad 👎"
3341,Noriko,2023-11-29,4.5,"Clean and comfortable airport hotel Perfect location (easy access to the airport), clean and big room, very comfortable bed and pillows, helpful staff. All good"
3342,Joseph,2023-11-28,4.5,"Superb I needed somewhere to stay at the airport last minute after plans changed and this was ideal. The staff were friendly and the room spacious, clean and comfortable. It gave me peace of mind. Everything was fine."
3343,Jillian,2023-11-28,4.5,"Very good, I will use this hotel in the future. Reception. Food. Comfort. Lack of hotel directions in multi-storey car park."
3344,Simone,2023-11-27,4.0,Very good 24 hour reception Comfortable bed Uninspiring breakfast Rather expensive
3345,Caroline,2023-11-26,4.5,"Superb Great location, excellent staff and rooms were comfortable. The menu in the bar area wasn't very good."
3346,Carol,2023-11-26,3.5,Clean and comfortable room with very good staff at the bar and restaurant . Location was good for the airport but unfortunately getting into the airport was difficult due to all the work on the transport system changes. As above
3347,Anne,2023-11-26,3.5,"Due to its location will stay again, but not the 'whow' factor I expected. Easy access to Bristol Airport. Communal seating areas were very impersonal. Thought that for a top rated hotel that the facilities could have been more 'luxutious'."

3354,Tandy,2023-11-24,4.0,Not up to previous experience! Comfortable bed Brad in reception very helpful at checkout due to taxi issues Walk from airport too long due to exterior works. Workmen drilling at 9am… Unable to process my credit card via booking. com due to their “machine not working”.. stressful check in procedure
3355,Aled,2023-11-24,4.0,"Very good Location although lots of roadworks, which could be managed better The price is excessive"

3358,Godelieve,2023-11-22,4.0,"Absolutely worth staying here the night before an early flight! Quiet, lovely, comfortable room. Very clean and modern facilities, welcoming atmosphere The quality of the food available was not geared towards healthy eating. It would be nice to be able to have a more ‘healthy’ meal before travelling."
3359,Jacqueline,2023-11-21,4.0,Very good Perfect location to catch flight early next day Room was nice beds were confy
3360,Cherry,2023-11-20,4.5,Comfortable stay with nice breakfast Proximity to airport and comfort. Breakfast was also good. Redirection from airport (I realise that this is temporary during works) as these meant quite a long walk from the property
3361,Robert,2023-11-20,4.0,Very pleasant 1 night stay but can be expensive Great location by the airport Price could have been better
3362,Michael,2023-11-20,4.0,"An excellent place to stay if you have a flight from Bristol airport Ecelent car parking, Organization of disabled transport to terminal for my wife. Allocation of ground floor room as my wife's walking is poor Great that breakfast started at 4am as we had an early morning staff Excellent bar staff Front desk very busy at peak periods Room rather smelly when we first went in AirCon/Heating a challenge Construction at airport meant a long walk with luggage to terminal (this was not the hotels' fault)"
3363,Olaf,2023-11-20,3.5,"Comfy and quiet hotel close to airport Close to airport, quiet and comfortable rooms, spacious bar/restaurant Inflexible on booking cancellations, expensive for what is a glorified Premier Inn"
3364,Ann,2023-11-20,4.0,"Handy for an early morning flight. Clean, comfortable, easy airport access. The shower wasn’t working properly."
3365,Caroline,2023-11-19,4.0,"Great place to stay if you are flying out early in the morning. Good breakfast, beds are very comfortable. The walk across the car park is a bit tricky due to ongoing work."
3366,Susan,2023-11-19,4.5,"Very good Staff were very welcoming The walk from the hotel to the tunnel to go to the airport. Was very dark. As a woman on her own, was not good."
3367,Roger,2023-11-19,4.0,Ok.  Food very basic eg burgers curry etc. a steak would be good or a salad! Not cheap food but motorway service standard. Most of us off on holiday would prefer something better. And healthier.
3368,Trevor,2023-11-19,4.0,"Ideal for a short stay. Close to the airport, The breakfast was really good. Nothing."
3369,Elizabeth,2023-11-16,4.0,Convenient but bar very expensive. At the airport but roadworks so long wet walk to departures As above
3370,Paula,2023-11-16,4.5,Superb Pleasant and helpful staff member on arrival even though it was 1.30am.. room had everything needed for overnight stay .. great breakfast and lovely staff on check out sign posting from terminal due to construction is poor and needs more lightning .. dark and wet on arrival and was difficult to see how to get to hotel
3371,Frances,2023-11-15,4.0,"Very good Handy for the airport, quick food service Extra bed in family room was uncomfortable"
3372,Derek,2023-11-15,3.5,Ok as a transient hotel you would not want to stay otherwise Close to airport Current problems with walkway to airport making it harder to drag a suitcase uphill with no reduction in rates due to this issue.
3373,Lesley,2023-11-14,4.5,Useful for early departures and late arrivals Close to the airport Because of the building works on the airport the walk from airport to Hotel is longer and uncovered. Not great when you arrive and it’s raining and you have 2 hold bags and 2 cabin bags after a 5 week stay out of the country.
3374,Loveday,2023-11-14,4.0,"Great location but food awful Our rooms were booked for the wrong dates by Booking.com - but the Hilton did manage to find us a room for the night and although we didnt get two rooms they did give us one for the 3 of us which was find and didnt charge us, so I was grateful for that. Booking.com messed up and booked us for the wrong nights - so we didnt get the two rooms I had booked - but just one. Our room wasn't that clean (snot on the wall - yuck) but as we were so tired we just ignored it. Food was pretty awful for the price and too early to have breakfast."
3375,Ken,2023-11-13,4.5,"Very good hotel at airport, but pity about access pathway diversion due to renovation of car parking. Proximity to airport, early Continental breakfast and standard of facilities. The tortuous path to get to it from the airport building due to the renovations of airport parking. Bathroom has nowhere to hang towels after you shower."
3376,Nicole,2023-11-11,4.5,"Fabulous, convenient but expensive Convenience and excellent friendly staff Expensive"
3377,Monica,2023-11-11,4.0,Apart from the coffee I liked everything. I liked everything except the coffee machine. I think it would be good to have proper coffee to start the day. Coffee from a machine always tastes awful. I didn't bring a car but I think the car park is too expensive.
3378,Shona,2023-11-10,4.5,"One night stay. Thought I would hear planes going in and out, but somehow, no noise! Queing up to register. Had to wait a good while, at registration desk."

3381,Barry,2023-11-08,3.5,Comfortable and convenient Close to airport Convenient parking Cost of parking could have been included in price for at least 1 or2 nights. Other hotels give substantial discount or free parking if staying longer than one night
3382,Michael,2023-11-07,4.5,Superb Very comfortable Price per room
3383,Kevin,2023-11-07,3.5,"Satisfactory. Excellent service from staff, they could not have been more helpful. Check-in was easy. Room and bathroom comfortable and clean. Duvet so thin that I had to put on socks! Cooked breakfast - I would expect fried and/ or poached eggs, not scrambled; neither do hard-boiled ones suffice."
3384,Dawn,2023-11-07,3.5,"Great Staff, Clean, Beds need making more comfy xx Staff friendly and proffesional I shared a room with my daughter as we had an early flight. I slept in the sofa bed. It was very hard and uncomfortable."
3385,Carole,2023-11-06,3.5,Convenient but expensive Close to terminal Expensive Not much food choice Not even a reduced parking incentive
3386,Ttg,2023-11-06,3.5,"Pleasant stay but could do better The reception / checking in personnel were polite and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful and nice seating area and enjoyable. We ate in the restaurant, although limited choices the food was acceptable but nothing special. The room seemed quite basic for a Hampton by Hilton, the bathroom could do with more hooks to hang your clothing, towels and more room to place toiletries on seemed limited on places to put your belongings. The bed seemed small for a king room."
3387,Jayne,2023-11-06,4.5,"Superb The location was very convenient, the room was comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful. The only drawback for our stay was that there was a lot of work being carried out in the airport grounds therefore the distance to walk was much further , so less convenient."
3388,Julieta,2023-11-05,4.0,Very good Breakfast since 4am One side of the bed kept dropping me out the bed due to bent mattress
3389,Suzy,2023-11-05,4.5,One night as very early start at airport. Breakfast from 4 am so able to eat something before we left. Staff very helpfu Close to airport.
3390,Martin,2023-11-05,3.5,"Difficult and tricky. All our clothes are soaking. It was refreshing to see everything you needed was there, and the staff were exceptional The problem is that Bristol Airport is undergoing major infrastructure changes and it took over an hour to drive from the main road to the hotel. We then had to do bag drop in the airport and the walk was 10 minutes in pouring rain with no canopy shelter. we had the same journey in the morning to the airport in the pouring rain. We are going on a cruise so had four bags to drag through and made paths. It was very dangerous on the roads approaching the hotel with people resorting to walking in the dark in the rain with no street lights. The car rental place took nearly an hour to get from the hotel to drop off and back again. Had we known this we would’ve stayed somewhere else."
3391,Bruce,2023-11-05,4.5,"Good- staff, clean room, pretty good value. Breakfast good. Dinner only fair in my book. Clean The long walk to the hotel from the airport and back. No shuttle service. Cab £42 each way, not good!."
3392,Michael,2023-11-04,4.0,So convenient for airport with very early flight. Noted continental breakfast available from 0400.. Room was perfect. Up to expectation. Rather expensive for single occupancy.
3393,Kate,2023-11-04,4.5,Would use again if flight time necessitated a stay. Great little airport hotel. Disappointed by poor breakfast - not the best continental offering. No cooked option available until 6am
3394,William,2023-11-03,4.5,Atm very poor access The room was excellent so were the staff .breakfast very good We booked the hotel due to the location being very close to the terminal however due to works being carried out its is a nightmare to get to on foot deffinatly not suitable for most people young families elderly or the disabled in particular with no shuttle assistance available which caused myself and wife alot of anxiety which after strenuously complaining to the hotel they did arrange disabled assistance which should have already been in place ..apart from that the hotel is fine in all other respects
3395,Joodles,2023-11-03,4.0,"Very good Comfortable, convenient stay very close to the airport building."
3396,Lucy,2023-11-03,4.0,"Convenient, clean and a good family breakfast included Location, breakfast, cleanliness We had multiple payment amounts pending in bank. This was resolved within 48 hours but the total was pending 3 times resulting in over a £1000 pending in my bank account"
3397,Joseph,2023-11-03,4.0,Great location The location and cleanliness. But the construction works around make the walk quite long.Lovely staff. Sausages undercooked.

3402,Raymond,2023-10-29,4.0,Pricey due to location No breakfast Friendlier staff
3403,Colin,2023-10-29,4.0,"Very good hotel - if you can find it nice modern hotel with all the facilities you might want Well the problem for me was getting to the hotel. It's hidden away behind the multistory car park. Because of the work going on at Bristol Airport, you had to follow signs which weren't obvious to begin with!"
3404,John,2023-10-29,4.5,Overnight stay for early flight. Location Maintenance works.
3405,Nicola,2023-10-28,4.5,Fantastic choice for overnight stay before travel Welcoming staff 🙂. Great atmosphere and fantastic breakfast 👍🏻 Pillows a little hard
3406,Sophie,2023-10-28,4.5,perfect apart from we were tired from flight 1.30am so misheard breakfast time😬 location clean very comfortable no fridge breakfast finished at 10am (we thought it was 10.30am so were 7 mins late for breakfast so missed it😭)
3407,Joanne,2023-10-28,3.5,Convenient - but not as convenient as my last stay Clean and tidy Building works mean it’s not really an easy walk in the middle of the night and certainly not well lit and signposted. This work is extensive so travellers should be made aware on booking
3408,Olga,2023-10-28,3.5,Good option if one has an early or late flight Great location with a possibility to check in any time. Comfortable rooms. Good shower and beds. Very expensive. Breakfast could have been better.
3409,Ada,2023-10-27,3.5,"Apart from the debit card problem, the stay was as expected. The room, the staff and the breakfast The evening meal selection. The now extended walk from the airport The fact that my debit card (despite being perfectly valid and used that very evening in the restaurant0 was declined and I had to use a different one."
3410,Mary-jane,2023-10-26,4.5,Very good and useful The situation. Friendly staff....clean and welcoming. Good ample breakfast. £9 for a glass of wine!!!! Somewhat OTT...... Wine definitely to be avoided in the future!
3411,Penny,2023-10-26,4.5,Our first stay at this hotel Was great. Amazing bathroom and room.was huge for the three of us.
3412,David,2023-10-25,4.0,Great if you can find it from the terminal ??? all fine will use again The directions from the airport left alot to desire at one in the morrning having followed the guide ended up in the car park???
3413,Lauren,2023-10-25,4.5,"Lovely Staff were excellent, rooms are lovely and the soaps etc provided The path to the hotel from the airport and back to the airport wasn't clear. It was dark when we arrived and left and walked a long road way to get there when extremely tired after flight delays, in the rain, carrying luggage, when it's literally over the road. Clearer signposted paths needed. Some sort of construction was happening so maybe that's what's happening. Left too early to get any breakfast. Would be nice if there was a bagged up to go option"
3414,Sarah,2023-10-24,4.5,"Great Closeness to the airport, comfy room, great shower, best breakfast No bar fridge"
3415,Kath,2023-10-24,4.5,"Relaxing comfortable stay The location is perfect and we were lucky to be given a ground floor room. The receptionist was excellent, could not have been more helpful. The beds were super comfy and the breakfast was amazing with so much choice The bathroom was clean, but there was a leak coming from something. We were so tired that we just put up with it. I did report it when checking out the next day"
3416,Leo,2023-10-23,4.5,"A busy but comfortable hotel doing a good job of managing guests' needs. Evening food was very efficiently provided to a busy room, and it was good quality food. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Room was the quietest I have ever found in a hotel. Location is excellent. Bed was somewhat hard. TV remote broken."
3417,Leanne,2023-10-23,4.0,Very good How clean it was very comfortable 😌
3418,Jane,2023-10-23,4.5,Ideally situated for airport and comfortable room and helpful staff. Good standards all round. Helpful staff. Not the fault of the property in any way but due to ‘works’ in the airport arrivals area the route from the hotel with large suitcase and cabin suitcase in the rain was not great!
3419,Michelle,2023-10-23,4.0,"Very good A lovely hotel, so easy for flying early for holiday! Although a bit pricey. Price"

3421,Daniel,2023-10-22,3.5,"Good hotel, needs improving in certain areas Location, clean room, friendly staff Price of food is comparable with other hotels, snacks are overpriced to the point of exploitation Breakfast could be better, no brown sauce, no fried eggs, poor quality bacon and sausages. £7 pint served in warm glass so beer flat had to change twice"
3422,Jackie,2023-10-21,3.5,"necessary, not by choice  beds were hard, food choices poor expensive food and drinks"
3423,Paul,2023-10-20,4.0,"Well functioning, modern, ideally located Great location, very clean and well functioning. Beds and pillows super comfortable You queue for service at bar like your getting school dinner. Did not like this Hotel has no personality"
3424,Andrea,2023-10-19,4.0,Very good Reception manned when we arrived in the early hours - friendly staff. A good choice of vegan options at breakfast. All OK thanks.
3425,Laureana,2023-10-19,4.0,Very good -close to the airport -reasonable food. Enjoyed the early breakfast. -lovely and helpful staff - No charging plugs in the room. I had to borrow an adapter downstairs because I have spanish plugs on my phone charger. I would expect an airport hotel room to have USB plugs. -My towel in my room was stained with makeup. It had been cleaned but it is not inviting to use a towel that was staines.
3426,Jerry,2023-10-19,4.0,"Very good Clean, good breakfast Due to the car park works at the airport the access to the hotel is a much longer distance and is very poorly signposted"
3427,Patrick,2023-10-19,3.5,Comfortable and convenient for early morning flight Proximity to airport for early morning flight It was expensive
3428,Christopher,2023-10-19,3.5,"Good  Pedestrian access to terminal is very bad. Deviations more than double the required walking distance. Staff excuse that this is the airport not the hotel, shows that the hotel is not doing enough to improve the situation. Staff did not warn that the hotel was “cash free” and we were unable to purchase drinks unless using credit cards. A warning upon arrival is necessary."
3429,Katharine,2023-10-19,4.0,Very good Surprisingly pleasant reception area and rooms A bit expensive

3432,Georgina,2023-10-17,3.5,Good Our second room once we were relocated was fine. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast choices good. Stayed one night due to late flights snd was conveniently close to the airport and bus stands. Not impressed after checking into our room to find the toilet with dried black faecal matter all around the pan. Rang reception and she said she would sort it and hung up. We didn't know if we were meant to wait or go back to reception. After a short time elapsed we rang again to be told it was being dealt with. Then we were were ushered to a room on another floor. No apologies just a excuse that the cleaners make mistakes. Not at all pleasant to walk into after along day.

3436,Claire,2023-10-16,4.0,"Very good Very convenient for the airport, literally a 5 minute walk to the terminal door. Comfortable room, friendly staff. Nice restaurant area, not huge choice but food good. Last time I stayed last year there was a breakfast bag to take away if you were on an early flight which didn't happen this year. Seeing as breakfast is included in the price we felt this was a bit of a con. If you're not going to supply anything then there should be a choice of price with breakfast included or not."
3437,Yvonne,2023-10-16,3.5,"Comfortable, clean but expensive Location. Clean and comfortable Pricey"
3438,Sandra,2023-10-16,4.5,"Comfortable nights stay prior to my journey. Accessible to airport, easy check in, and friendly staff. Quiet too considering near the airport. Very clean. Nothing"
3439,Caldwell,2023-10-15,4.5,"It was really comfortable and easy - an excellent airport hotel. Bed exceptionally comfortable, room spacious and breakfast excellent. Slightly limited bar snacks and eating option late at night (when I arrived)."
3440,Michael,2023-10-15,4.5,All OK It was very convenient for the airport The trek from the coach park to the hotel.
3441,Lin,2023-10-15,4.5,Very comfortable quiet rooms with great facilities Clem modern rooms very well equipped with a great shower and lovely fluffy towels Great gym The price of two glasses of wine at the bar!! The path from the hotel to the terminal building was close for building work and the diversion was a very long way around
3442,Andrew,2023-10-15,4.5,Superb Unexpectedly good pre 6am breakfast
3443,Andrew,2023-10-13,4.5,Fine for the short time we stayed. Air conditioning in the eating area was too cold and uncomfortab Too early a flight for proper breakfast. Takeaway bag for breakfast supplied by hotel pretty unexciting. Breakfast bag
3444,Julie,2023-10-12,3.5,Okay At the airport All the work going on outside the building had to take my case a long way around
3445,Geoff,2023-10-12,4.0,"Convenient, did what it said on the can booked last minute, overnight stay, no issues Nothing"
3446,Ian,2023-10-12,4.0,"Will use again Clean, colour schemes were fine, staff were great, from check in to bar and supper and a super bright ‘good morning’ at 0350hrs. Breakfast and supper, although not stunning in choice, filled us with no complaints To be honest, given this is a Premier Inn level airport hotel, it was clean with a nice bed, sufficient room and the social areas were fine. There was nothing to dislike"
3447,Richard,2023-10-11,4.0,"Convenient for Early morning flight We have stayed here many times and as usual everything was great - however Bristol airport has changed over the last 5 years so its not such an attractive location to stay for travellers with 2 large bags and using Rental car as Avis etc ( who used to be just a short walk from the Hotel ) have moved(been moved ) to Silverstone Parking so you have to check in at the hotel, drop your bags, get an hour of free parking then drive out of the hotel car park , drop the car at Silver Stone parking then get the bus to the terminal - since there were no trolleys provided, I grabbed one at the Terminal and took it all the way to our room No trolleys at the hotel - long walk to terminal in the morning due to extensive Bristol Airport extensions to Car Parks etc - thats not the Hotel's fault but it makes it less attractive. That said for early morning flight still the best place to stay near the airport."
3448,Jacqui,2023-10-11,4.5,"Convenient, welcoming Clean & modern The restaurant was nice but the queuing system to order wasn’t great."
3449,Patricia,2023-10-10,4.0,Satisfactory Everything! Evening meal
3450,Michael,2023-10-09,4.0,Very good As an airport hotel it had everything you need. very clean. comfortable and efficient. Continental breakfast from 4.00am was perfect for an early flight. Parking by the hotel is very convenient and the hotel is close to the airport departures. nothing
3451,Lesley,2023-10-09,4.5,"Probably stay elsewhere and catch a shuttle bus next time we go away. Close to Airport, friendly helpful staff The detour walk to the airport whilst the building works in place. Fortunately it wasn’t raining. Would have been drenched if it had been. The food choice for evening meals was very limited."
3452,Asta,2023-10-09,3.5,"Good Nice room,lovely staff and very clean. Difficult to get with wheelchair from bus station. Long corridor till the room with wheelchair and luggage...not much space in room for disabled person and night light is impossible to turn on with arthritis in fingers. Comfortable beds,but child's bed edges very sharp."
3453,Wendy,2023-10-09,4.5,Convenient for early morning flight Convenient Bathroom sliding door was very stiff and heavy to open
3454,Kirstine,2023-10-09,4.0,"The hotel suited these weary travellers perfectly. In Bristol Airport. The perfect location for the weary traveller. Good reception at 3am. Nice, comfortable,clean room. with excellent sound proofing. Perfect after a long, tiring journey and flight. Wandering around the self service breakfast which closed ruthlessly at 10am."
3455,Deborah,2023-10-09,4.5,"Superb Staff very helpful and accommodating, bar at nightmare good, breakfast very tasty 😋"
3456,Michael,2023-10-09,3.5,"Clean and modern and quick access to the airport but the price is outrageous. It was easy to locate and a short walk to departures. The room was modern and had everything we needed and was clean and comfortable. Breakfast is included in the price but was of no use to us as we had an early flight. However the cost per night of this hotel stings! £180 to stay for 1 night is a little outrageous to be honest. Airport hotel or not! We could have parked for 2 weeks for less, which will be our preferred option if the price is still high when we are travelling from Bristol again."
3457,Tim,2023-10-09,4.5,Superb Near airport Great check in staff Nothing

3459,Mcmahon,2023-10-09,4.5,Superb Close to airport and very Accommodating
3460,Mcmahon,2023-10-09,4.5,Superb Close to airport and they are very accommodating Food can be hot and miss
3461,Margaret,2023-10-08,4.5,Close to airport perfect Great location to airport
3462,Melissa,2023-10-08,4.0,Very good Very good Nil
3463,Paula,2023-10-08,4.0,The location is fab. Will definitely be back. Room was lovely and quiet. Spotlessly clean. Location couldn’t have been better. The pillows were very uncomfortable which spoilt the quality of sleep. Breakfast was disappointing. It’s very expensive.
3464,David,2023-10-07,4.0,Clean and comfortable but don’t waste money eating their food. Clean and comfortable. The food was TERRIBLE. Clearly designed to be as profitable as possible for The Hilton Group and a miserable experience for the customer. The Singapore Noodles that I had were tasteless and such a mean portion that I was still hungry after finishing them.
3465,Elizabeth,2023-10-07,4.0,Very good Breakfast was great
3466,Alison,2023-10-07,4.0,"Convenient short stay How near it is to airport terminal, Comfy beds and breakfast Checking in, the receptionist asked for payment again, but i had already paid months in advance."
3467,Maureen,2023-10-07,4.0,Very good All very good breakfast and staff very helpful
3468,Annette21,2023-10-06,4.5,"staff friendly, welcoming, provided a carrier bag breakfast due to pre 4.00am departure is brilliant The hotel is right by the airport, but there were quite a lot of steps and I would not have managed them alone with a heavy suitcase. The room was excellent - clean and comfortable. We were at the back and able to go to bed at 9pm without being woken by noise of guests or flights. Breakfast to go was very much appreciated at 3.40 am! The food in the restaurant was not as good as I had expected: the choice was limited for me, and the burger and chips I ordered as a last resort was not overwhelming, just ok. My husband chose a curry and was very happy with that. It just shows how our tastes affect our reviews. So other guests would probably love the food choices!! I didn't like the two flights of steps between the hotel and the airport departures."
3469,Martin,2023-10-06,4.0,Very good Close to the airport. Clean. Friendly staff Quite expensive for a basic hotel.
3470,Penelope,2023-10-06,3.5,"An ideal location and a comfortable stay. The fact that the hotel is just across from the airport. I liked the comfort of the rooms and proximity to airport and coach station. I do not think the standard of breakfast matches the standard of the hotel generally. For instance, last time I stayed there was a choice of fruit and yogurt which seemed to have disappeared this time. I found the level of lighting in my room very low when I arrived in the middle of the night, and needed to quickly find things in my suitcase."
3471,Chris,2023-10-06,4.0,"Very good  The food was ok, not good."
3472,Jo,2023-10-06,4.5,"Modern, well thought out hotel built for comfort and convenience to the airport. Modern clean and fresh. Convenient to airport and yet well insulated and really quiet. Staff very friendly, efficient. Food very good. Everything was great."
3473,Bowden,2023-10-05,4.5,Superb Perfect hotel Nothing I did not like
3474,Claire,2023-10-05,4.0,"Site works at the moment The hotel is handy for a pre early flight stay. My husband has difficulty walking, but when we said we had assisted travel, a member of staff arranged for us to be picked up by the airport assistance staff. This was excellent, but I think the hotel needs to tell more of their staff about this facility, another member of staff suggested we could have got a taxi at about £15. There are site works going on between the airport and the hotel, so it was hard to get to the hotel."
3475,Linda,2023-10-05,3.5,hotel great once you got inside. outside not good. always a quiet and comfortable stay access was shocking on this occasion. building works all around the access making it dangerous and difficult. Couldn’t find a ramp access to the airport so had to carry luggage up lots of steep steps.
3476,Elizabeth,2023-10-04,4.5,Great location for airport stay Location close to terminal The very high costs of car parking at least the first night of staying should be complimentary
3477,Anne,2023-10-04,4.0,"Always good as the airport is over the road, but only flying so early will stop us thinking about alternative accommodat The proximity to the airport, the cleanliness, staff and included breakfast. The bed and pillows weren’t comfortable. We felt the mattress needed replacing."
3478,Anthony,2023-10-04,4.0,Nice hotel but expensive. Room and food available.
3479,Iftekhar,2023-10-04,4.0,Great location with lovely staff The location to Bristol airport is perfect Nothing to say
3480,Deborah,2023-10-03,4.0,"Very good good choice of breakfast , staff are friendly and helpful , great hotel to stay at before a flight from Bristol airport"
3481,Andrew,2023-10-03,4.5,"Extremely convenient, high quality, high price. Perfect position for the airport, comfortable, clean, exceptionally attentive staff and a really good breakfast starting early enough for the first flights. The parking arrangements are at first sight a little daunting; however the staff can help once you have the courage to pass through the barrier! The hotel is priced to exploit a captive market - don’t expect a discount. You pay for what you get convenience."
3482,Peter,2023-10-03,4.5,Good clean and convenient stay Convenient location for airport Slot of work going on around the airport surroundings
3483,Peter,2023-10-02,4.5,A really good end to our holiday on kos Top quality and value of the evening special on the menu and as always a good hotel breakfast The pathway to the airport was badly effected by construction
3484,Rebecca,2023-10-02,4.0,"Great, convenient and friendly staff Location is great for flights out of Bristol Airport and long stay parking adjacent. Staff really friendly and good bar/restaurant for evening meal. It’s quite expensive for one night stays. We left too early before breakfast was served but it would have been good if we could have been offered a continental breakfast/take away. Also couldn’t get anyone to help with the £5 drop off charge as it was so busy at reception so ended up paying it."
3485,Richard,2023-10-02,3.5,Overpriced for what it is. All about closeness to airport Close to airport terminal and spacious room The cost for what is little more than a travel lodge.
3486,Ian,2023-10-02,4.0,Very good Easy next to airport Nothing
3487,Wayne,2023-10-02,4.5,Great location but you pay for it. Very good hotel in general All as expected Cost is an issue that needs to be considered with this hotel
3488,Jennifer,2023-10-01,3.5,Good  Price
3489,Richard,2023-10-01,3.5,Convenient but overpriced Easy walking distance to the airport Rather soulless airport. Breakfast in the bag was very limited
3490,Graeme,2023-10-01,4.5,Superb Quiet room
3491,John,2023-10-01,4.5,"Fine- very much what I needed, very comfortable and convenient. Good room, perfect location for my purposes, food very good, both on arrival ( the pizza is great) and at Breakfast the next morning. Excellent service, very friendly and helpful staff. The parking was a bit more expensive than advertised, and very confusing. Also, foot access to the airport is rather convoluted due to construction work."
3492,Susan,2023-10-01,4.0,"Ideal place to stay if on an early morning flight Room was very good and the breakfast first class Explaining how to get to the Hotel carpark, when we phoned the hotel and asked for the instructions on how to find the car park, the instructions were vague and unclear. It cost us £7.50 as we parked in the wrong car park, when we arrived at the hotel and explained this to one of the staff they were very unhelpful about are suituation, saying it was very easy to find your carpark."
3493,Roger,2023-09-30,4.5,Superb Comfortable hotel and friendly staff. Bristol Airport. Renovations which will last for 18 months. Make access to the hotel difficult. A long walk in the pouring rain.
3494,Lesley-ann,2023-09-29,4.0,Convenient for airport Near airport Building works
3495,David,2023-09-29,3.5,Had to queue twice at reception. All very handy for airport. Were told we couldn't buy a drink at the bar until we had registered at reception to be able to do so. Had already stood in a queue to check in then had to go back and do it again. Never known anything like it - just to get a glass of wine!
3496,Alison,2023-09-29,4.0,"Ok for the convenience Mostly good. Rooms as nice as usual. Requested an extra sheet which was in the bedroom on arrival - very happy :) Staff are always nice Handy M&S in the airport terminal prior to departures (not overpriced) so we picked up a few nibbles. Early breakfast (03:00) take out was rubbish. Dry croissant, horrid apple juice and an apple or banana - that was it. Expected a much better selection for 'continental' -perhaps a portion of cheese and crackers if you don't like sweet for breakfast which I do not. Have had a much nicer breakfast at the hotel when our flight was later in the morning. Room was very nice, as expected, although it is overpriced for a room but I suppose you pay for the convenience being at the airport!"
3497,Dwayne,2023-09-29,4.0,Polite staff excellent service Convenience ￼to airport Overpriced
3498,Kathryn,2023-09-29,4.0,Very good Lovely reception staff. Everything clean and well maintained. Incredibly convenient location to the airport Price of food/drink at hotel. Having stayed here in July and paid £40 for two tiny servings of pasta and 2 glasses of red wine. Decided to get food from M and S at the airport. Much cheaper.
3499,Deborah,2023-09-28,3.5,Good Location Was expensive with no other alternative available
3500,Sasha,2023-09-27,4.0,Very good Great location. Nice hotel. Bathroom and rooms are lovely. The beds are so uncomfortable. Food was not great. The burger was poor.
3501,Michael,2023-09-26,3.5,"Clean, modern hotel ideally located for early morning flight. Breakfast & evening meal adequate but pricey. Room good, clean & everything worked. Super bed. Alarm call right on time. Helpful staff. Access to airport terminal through building site - not something that could be helped at present. Shower tray slippery."
3502,Barbara,2023-09-26,4.0,Good location and friendly staff. Location Not the easiest check-in process.
3503,Julia,2023-09-26,3.5,"It was OK for an early morning departure The staff were helpful, and the room was clean but basic. The food in the restaurant downstairs was awful. Because we were staying there specifically to fly out the next morning, we didn't want to head into town, so it was the only option. Also, there is no shuttle to the airport. It should be a short walk but the usual path was all dug up so we had to drag heavy cases a long way."
3504,Martine,2023-09-26,3.5,good enough for one night stay and perfect for flying.  no usb points. no little extras like toothpaste would have been useful. restaurant is horrible. no flexibility . rather cold in the room.
3505,Anne,2023-09-25,4.0,Great Very helpful staff Nothing
3506,Grantmavrata,2023-09-25,3.5,"Good, but not very good. Location to the airport was very convenient, even on very late arrival just gone midnight, signage was easy to follow through groundwork being done. Was expensive compared to other chains we often use. No USB sockets in the room, often quite common these days. Nobody greeting guests at breakfast. Details but expected a little more for over £200 for a night. It was a convenient option for a kate flight."
3507,John,2023-09-25,4.0,"Quite good overall Breakfast was ok I suspect scrambled eggs were powdered, bacon was hardly cooked."
3508,Hamish,2023-09-23,4.0,Very good Super efficient and friendly staff. Clean and spacious hotel. Perfect for an early morning flight.
3509,Julie,2023-09-23,4.5,"Excellent location It’s location on Bristol Airports site is so convenient Nice size room, slept extremely well Very clean and comfortable, staff lovely The evening meal quality was very poor, Shame it let the hotel down"
3510,Judy,2023-09-22,4.0,Overall very good Convenient generally very happy
3511,Gary,2023-09-21,3.5,We’ll stay there again if the need comes up Great location Midnight fire alarm wasn’t on our agenda. Not property fault.
3512,Norma,2023-09-21,4.0,Very good Close to airport
3513,Grahame,2023-09-20,4.0,Very good Enjoyed my stay apart from being woken by fire alarm at 12pm Fire alarm going off after being asleep for 2 hours. Didn't seem very organised.. Room no wasn't taken How did they know every body was out of building?
3514,Elizabeth,2023-09-19,4.5,"Lovely staff Friendly, helpful staff. Some snacks in the room would be appreciated."
3515,Michael,2023-09-19,4.0,Very good Location is key Price
3516,Graham,2023-09-19,3.5,Good Convenience to airport Better restaurant experience - menu was a bit basic
3517,Peter,2023-09-19,4.0,"Convenient The location was perfect and the very early morning breakfast was very convenient for early morning flights. It was disappointing that the free Wi-Fi did NOT have an internet connection, also that one of the bedside cabinets was broken. Not what I expected from a Hampton by Hilton hotel !"
3518,David,2023-09-18,4.5,"Very enjoyable, lovely breakfast Very clean & modern Didn’t expect to walk quite so far from the airport at 1oclock in the morning, but of cause road works need to be done."
3519,Frederic,2023-09-18,4.5,Superb  A/c too cold at the restaurant
3520,Bethan,2023-09-18,4.0,Great start to the holiday. Great location and early breakfast.
3521,Hugh,2023-09-17,4.0,"Great, smart, clean, handy hotel with friendly and professional staff! Good all round! The location is excellent for the airport, it could hardly be easier. The transport options to the airport all worked well without the pressure of an early start in the day if travel. Nothing springs to mind!"
3522,Robert,2023-09-17,3.5,Good place to stay before a morning flight from Bristol Large airy bar and restaurant area. Nothing to add
3523,Richard,2023-09-17,4.0,"Ideal location and easy to reach from the airport, was somewhat expensive due presumably to this Location ease of booking in and cleanliness of the hotel The shower room had a major issue with the run off to the drain and flooded the bathroom and entrance way to the bedroom area I informed the staff but the problem is obviously due to poor design"
3524,Ed,2023-09-17,4.0,Perfect place to stay after a late arrival Very close to arrivals. Bar open late. I think signage via the route to buses is a waste of time for arriving passengers. Survey better to direct left outside arrivals.
3525,Christine,2023-09-17,3.5,"Good Have used the hotel since built. Perfect for the airport. The price has virtually doubled. £180 for just one night, booked well in advance is a lot."
3526,Julian,2023-09-17,4.0,"Great staff, lovely room. Good bed. Good choice for breakfast. Location. Close to the airport The walk from the airport is a bit of a bomb site"
3527,Ruth,2023-09-17,4.5,"Lovely stay Clean & comfortable. Room was spacious. Good breakfast options. A short walk to the airport, very convenient. Buses to/from Bristol & Bath regularly a short walk from the hotel."
3528,Fiona,2023-09-16,4.0,Great location if you want to take the stress out of an early flight Location on the airport site as we had an early flight. Staff were friendly and helpful.
3529,Vinny,2023-09-16,3.5,"Good Lovely big room, comfortable bed No drinking water in the room Breakfast was very poor, cold plates,bacon and sausage looked boiled ,didn't even bother."
3530,Roland,2023-09-15,4.0,OK Reception very helpful for our late at night arrival Windows completely sealed. we wanted some fresh air
3531,Grant,2023-09-14,4.5,"Comfortable stay in good location with everything I needed. Having a decent gym with working equipment in good condition was really good. Meal options were fine. Bar comfortable. Male staff member on reception was a bit short with me when I asked about a receipt. He explained I would get it after I checked out as if I should know, I paid a lot of money the day before and needed to claim it back from my employer so it was important to me. I just needed a pleasant explanation."
3532,Thibault,2023-09-13,4.0,"The only way to stay near the airport + Location + Quality - Price, is way overpriced"
3533,Becky,2023-09-12,3.5,"Good The staff were friendly and helpful. I could share a room with my two daughters, making it more affordable. The room was ideal - clean, well designed and just what we needed. Food was pretty good and amazingly, breakfast was available from 4am so early flights don't have to mean missing breakfast! So super convenient for Bristol Airport - great to be able to walk from the carpark to the hotel and from the hotel to the airport. No complaints - exactly what we needed."
3534,Yoland,2023-09-12,4.0,Very good Perfect for what we needed before an early flight. Breakfast service starts early enough for those needing to leave early. Simple but tasty dinner choices.
3535,Helen,2023-09-11,4.0,We would stay again but hope for more pillows. Friendly helpful staff. Good size room Lack of pillows!!
3536,Andrew,2023-09-11,4.5,"Lovely rooms, great staff, need deep pockets Location was great, apart from the surrounding civil works to improve access, which was difficult to navigate amongst bus queues and barriers. Room was lovely, shame we only spent 4.5 hours in it due to our late arrival, Room not ready due to demand, and a very early departure. Clean and pleasant bar area, staff lovely. Overall pleased with the hotel. Breakfast was basic at the early time we needed to leave for our departure, and there was too little food on display, with no staff around to replenish the food items, mostly run out of choice. For the overnight stay cost, including breakfast, we were very disappointed, and hungry during our day of travel. This was a letdown for us, especially paying £230 for a single night, we expected a better Breakfast experience, and not need to spend more money on food during our travels. Also, drinks in the bar were very expensive, seems a captive audience are charged way over the normal going rate."
3537,Neil,2023-09-11,4.5,Superb Location. Cost.
3538,Diane,2023-09-11,4.0,Quite a lot of money for a large modern clean soulless room at convenient place for flight The breakfast was it's redeemable feature. I had croissants and fruit and yogurt and coffee. The breakfast was really good quality . Very pleased with the breakfast. It felt more homely and family orientated for the breakfast. A bit more heart and soul. Liked the decor and the happy slogans. It was a bit of a shock that you queued up to place an order for food. As my friend said an expensive MacDonalds. Coincidentally I ended up ordering the burger bun and chips. I felt starving hungry and needed something to fill me up. The burger was really good. So it worked 😁. Next time I would know what to expect. Might try another food option. Like the noodles for example. Just was expecting a sit down restaurant with table service like other airport hotels. I thought maybe they had trouble getting staff. The receptionist said there was no proper kitchen on site. Did not really like the atmosphere of the evening dining. Lovely chairs dining area but felt soulless in the evening. The company could have a better chance here to win hearts and minds.
3539,Christine,2023-09-11,4.0,Comfortable beds so well rested before a long day of travelling We had an early flight but the Continental breakfast had a good choice of items Separating drinks only from the food ordering queue might have been more efficient
3540,Anne,2023-09-10,3.5,Convenient overnight stay for departure flight. Within easy walking distance of airport. Comfortable bed in quiet room with air conditioning. Good breakfast. Evening meal was disappointing. The choice was limited so felt the meals on offer should have been of a higher standard. Curry has small amounts of chicken and no flavour.
3541,Linda,2023-09-10,4.0,Very good Beds Quality of jacket potatoes in restaurant
3542,Mike,2023-09-10,4.0,"Convenient The location couldn't be better. Enjoyed the curry Building work outside had bad signing, we walked a few hundred yards to go just a few, it was confirmed at reception that a lot of customers had suffered the same, it would have been good if someone had sorted it out so that we could have got there a lot more directly."
3543,Paul,2023-09-10,4.5,Superb Location is superb. Breakfast was excellent Could be a better walk way to get to the hotel from the airport
3544,Don,2023-09-09,4.5,"Overall our stay was great - but brief as we checked in late afternoon & checked out early next day Nice, clean room, very quiet which was appreciated as we had an early flight on checkout day. Staff were all helpful, courteous, and very good at what they do. Delicious food in the restaurant. And cold beer! Nothing really. Maybe the fact our Uber driver had to pay a fee - which was passed on to us - to drop us at the front entrance of the hotel."
3545,Kenneth,2023-09-08,3.5,"Good Quick check in,room had everything you need Bathroom was good,with good shower and toiletries. Great breakfast , good coffee and ample choice. It's the airport,so we know we are going to pay extra for most things,but felt this was taken to extreme. I stayed in a hotel at Heathrow,10 days previously,same company ,but half the price. Also felt bar prices were expensive,pint and gin and tonic 21pounds."
3546,Stacey,2023-09-08,4.0,Very good Nice welcome after a delayed flight
3547,Heulwenn,2023-09-08,4.0,Very good Easy check in and check out. Some staff were non talkative. Some would also ask you stuff to make conversation and were then very uninterested or wouldn't listen. Took a while to clean up any tables in the evening
3548,Glyn,2023-09-07,4.5,Latest stay Location facilities comfort Nothing
3549,Sarah,2023-09-06,4.0,"Small room but clean and good breakfast. Great location. Tasty breakfast with a lot of variety. Clean room and nice toiletries in bathroom. Nice and quiet - couldn’t hear outside noise at all, or other guests. Tiny room and small bed. For travellers arriving with a lot of luggage, as you would expect near an airport, there is next to no space for luggage. We had our daughter with us so the couch was made into a bed so no space in that part of the room for us to put anything. Pillows were very uncomfortable."
3550,Helen,2023-09-06,4.0,Very good Location is excellent Rooms are small for a family
3551,Kimberley,2023-09-06,3.5,"Good Breakfast was very good, so much variety. Great location for early morning flights with only walking distance to airport"
3552,Francis,2023-09-06,3.5,"Good Friendly staff, excellent facilities just a shame I didn't have more time to use them. Very close to the airport so easy for early morning flight. Not being able to sleep for as long."
3553,Christopher,2023-09-06,3.5,Great overnight stop for Bristol Airport Perfect location for Bristol Airport Nothing
3554,Sophie,2023-09-05,3.5,"Good value for money The room was very beautiful & rustic Italian, it was good value for money & the lady running it sent me a video on how to unlock the door, where the iron was etc & met me in a local restaurant to give me the key While it says private bathroom, this is separate from the room & there is a room in between. Which is fine but may be off putting for others as not clearly described"
3555,Pauline,2023-09-05,4.0,We had a very pleasant stay and the hotel is very convenient for the airport the room was large and very comfortable The bed was very comfortable The bathroom with a shower was very clean and spacious. The bar area and area where you order food are combined so when its busy there is a queue.
3556,Debbie,2023-09-05,4.0,Short walk from hotel Close to airport expensive for our few hours stay
3557,Raymond,2023-09-04,4.0,Very good So conveniently located by the airport and rooms are very comfortable and quiet
3558,Andrew,2023-09-04,4.0,Practical but canteen restaurant Close to airport Restaurant was basic for quality hotel
3559,Sara,2023-09-03,4.0,Convenient Conveniently located across from the terminal. Breakfast served from 4am. Kind staff. A bit pricy for what it is. Could use a renovation.
3560,Jane,2023-09-03,4.0,Very good Convenient for the airport
3561,Susan,2023-09-03,4.0,So convenient for airport I would come again. Distance to terminal. Pricey gin and tonic.
3562,William,2023-09-02,4.0,Very pleasant stay Everything was satisfactory -no complaints -would stay again if flying from Bristol
3563,Peter,2023-09-02,4.0,Location Location Location Location Location Location Evening dinner portions at the restaurant were small
3564,Richard,2023-09-01,3.5,Expensive Clean and modern Food from restaurant small portions and very expensive
3565,Marina,2023-09-01,4.0,Very good  The car park charged me £192 for an overnight stay on my credit card and my debit card. Not happy.
3566,Simon,2023-08-31,4.0,Very good Very convenient to the airport and the rooms were very well insulated against noise ( such as aircraft movements) snd lights. Our stay was too short
3567,Tracey,2023-08-31,4.5,"Convenient, clean Location Clean Staff excellence N/a"
3568,Jane,2023-08-31,4.5,Great place to stay for an early flight Location. Comfy bed. Good shower N/a

3571,Hazel,2023-08-30,4.5,Excellent for stay. Didn’t have time for much breakfast! What we had was good. Don’t know.
3572,Carey,2023-08-30,4.5,Very handy for Bristol Airport The closeness to the airport. We could walk from the hotel to the terminal within 5 or so minutes. It was quite a basic hotel and seemed very expensive for the facilities available.
3573,Beth,2023-08-30,4.0,"Super convenient for Bristol Airport, bit pricey but can walk to the terminal The shower design was really nice, very modern with quality soap and lotion provided. Lovely touch that they give you a breakfast bag to go if you leave early for a flight before the cooked breakfast starts. The mattress was good, not the most comfy I've ever had at a hotel, but good for the night. The pillows were very nice."
3574,Sonia,2023-08-30,4.5,"Nice relaxing way to start a holiday Convenient location to Bristol Airport, great way to start a holiday Limited evening meal menu"
3575,Maire,2023-08-28,4.5,An ideal spot for that early morning flight. This hotel is so close to the airport which was ideal for us with an early morning flight. A good choice of food available for the evening and a lovely choice for breakfast the following morning at 4am. The staff were so welcoming and helpful. Nothing.
3576,Julie,2023-08-28,4.0,"Great location, care with parking charges! Room was fine and great location for early flight Car parking charges not as advertised and managers attitude when challenged left allot to be desired. Get you don't own car park but don't advertise one rate on website and another at entrance to car park"
3577,Kirsteen,2023-08-28,4.0,Very good Large comfortable beds No charge points for phone in room
3578,Sally,2023-08-27,4.0,Very good Friendly and welcoming and excellent location
3579,Jerry,2023-08-27,4.0,Very good All Nothing
3580,Seamus,2023-08-27,3.5,Ideal location to airport for early flight Great location from the hotel - literally across the road. Nice early breakfast offering. Quite expensive for basic room but I did book it quite late. Food area was too busy for dinner.
3581,Emma,2023-08-26,4.0,"Great for early flights The staff were helpful, the room was great - spacious, well presented and modern, and the restaurant served a good choice of food. Service was good too. I wasn't impressed that I had to pay an additional fee for parking at the hotel. This should be included as part of the room price, as you would expect patrons of the property to be the only ones using the parking available."
3582,Christopher,2023-08-26,4.5,"As expected. Nice place to stay. All good, as expected. Clean and spotless. Lovely buffet breakfast. Ideally situated a short walk from the airport."
3583,Martha,2023-08-26,4.5,very comfortable beds and helpful staff. the hotel is in a super handy location a very short walk from the airport so is ideal. the prices are rather high I guess it is a captive market.
3584,Doreen,2023-08-26,4.5,A comfortable clean room and great location to the airport Location to airport. Able to walk there A little expensive for a single traveler
3585,Lynda,2023-08-26,4.5,"Excellent definitely recommend the hotel Early breakfast, 5 o’clock was more than adequate Nice quiet room Nothing to dislike at all"
3586,Julia,2023-08-24,4.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay and wished we'd got up earlier for a full breakfast. Exceptionally clean, very quiet and the early breakfast was fantastic. The frosted glass on the bathroom door although opaque, still allowed the silhouette image of the person in the bathroom and what they were doing could be seen by occupants in the bedroom."
3587,Krustine,2023-08-23,4.5,A comfortable place to rest weary heads 😊 Our easy jet flight was cancelled and delayed 12 hrs - last minute booking - met all our needs - we booked in at 2345hrs and left at 0445 - comfortable place to rest weary heads
3588,Pierce,2023-08-22,4.0,Adequate Location The system for serving drinks at the bar
3589,Julie,2023-08-21,4.5,Convenient overnight stop for early or late flights Our plane was delayed so we were late getting back to Bristol airport and rather than drive 2 hours in the middle of the night we found this hotel a convenient place to stay. Very comfortable bed and nice buffet breakfast. Staff very helpful too. Parking a little expensive but that’s airport hotels for you...
3590,Robert,2023-08-21,4.5,"Superb Great location, close to airport"
3591,Mary,2023-08-21,3.5,"Convenient but expensive airport hotel Location is great - a few minutes walk from airport terminal. Room is fine & breakfast ok. The company continues to use feather bedding, which I'm highly allergic to. I noted this when I made the booking & sent a subsequent message on booking.com but received no acknowledgement or response. However reception had a note & checked the bedding was hypoallergenic. So it was resolved BUT it would be much better if the company just stopped using this. I've stayed in many hotels in recent years across Europe, Asia & South America and it seems to be ONLY Hampton & Radisson hotels at UK airports that continue to use feathers & to refuse to put safety of guests first. PLEASE CAN THIS BE REVIEWED. I shouldn't have to make this request when I book at a hotel, especially at the prices charged. I am sure you take other allergies eg. peanuts seriously so it would be much appreciated - & easier for you -if you avoided risks by using the types of bedding now in use at the vast majority of hotels."
3592,Sara,2023-08-21,4.0,Clean comfortable and quiet! Location
3593,John,2023-08-20,4.0,good for early flight ok so you can get breakfast early but only continental free parking would of been nice
3594,Kylie,2023-08-20,4.5,"Great location, very convenient. Extremely comfortable stay before our early morning flight! The location was excellent - very easy for an early flight. We liked everything"
3595,Sian,2023-08-20,4.0,Very good Convenient Quite expensive
3596,Simon,2023-08-20,3.5,Good 2 min walk to departure. Overpriced
3597,Carol,2023-08-20,4.5,Great for an overnight stay Location. Walking distance to airport Limited menu in restaurant/bar
3598,Jayne,2023-08-20,4.0,Very convenient stay for airport - peaceful hotel in great location Location for airport Very clean Very quiet Menu choice could be better
3599,Gemma,2023-08-18,3.5,Comfortable and practical Perfect location for an early flight I paid double what my travel partner paid
3600,Lawrence,2023-08-18,4.0,Very good  Food menu poor and expensive
3601,Julija,2023-08-17,4.0,"Very good Location, facilities Price is too expensive"
3602,John,2023-08-17,4.5,"Great location, good value for money, helpful and friendly staff Location was excellent, arrival process was seamless, would certainly look at booking again. Nothing"
3603,Jon,2023-08-17,4.0,Convenient. Comfortable. Spacious. Clean. Great location for terminal for early morning flight Nothing
3604,Mark,2023-08-16,3.5,Easy start to our holiday! Great location. Staff were helpful. The food was expensive and poor quality.
3605,Martyn,2023-08-15,4.0,Did the job Functional Impersonal
3606,Lee,2023-08-15,4.0,"Very good Location superb,no stress for airport transfer"
3607,Nicola,2023-08-15,4.5,Perfect for overnight stay before early morning flight Very helpful reception staff
3608,Mark,2023-08-15,4.0,Very handy when you have an early flight The Hotel is on site at the airport so I often use it when I am flying early. Rooms are very nice and modern and exrtemely quiet. Stayed here more that once. Used the restaurant in the evening and breakfast in the morning which starts at 4am. Price is a lot higher than similar hotels (close to £200 a night) but they know you have little other option I suppose. Doesnt stop me using the hotel but the principle bothers me a bit!
3609,Graham,2023-08-15,4.0,Ideal location if rather expensive Clean and modern. Ideal location for early flight. Sink and shower drains not flowing well. Reported on departure and sure they will be fixed. Hotel has something of a monopoly for “on airport” location which probably explains rather high cost for very short stay.
3610,Bruce,2023-08-14,4.0,"Convenient It was basically an airport transfer hotel and the facilities suitable to cover passenger needs The convenience to the airport although, due to airports ground works we had to walk further than expected"
3611,Mark,2023-08-14,4.5,Convenient for airport very friendly and competent staff great breakfast Good breakfast staff very friendly and helpful Could always be cheaper Put times of breakfast and dinner on website
3612,Sally,2023-08-13,4.5,"Although we only stayed for 6 hours due to a delayed flight, everything was great! The lady on the desk at 3 in the morning (our plane was severely delayed) was lovely and smiley. The same can be said for the next shift. Breakfast was welcome and good as well as being included within the price. Nothing as far as I can see. The hotel served its purpose for us."
3613,Jonathan,2023-08-12,3.5,Flying from Bristol Lots of choice at Breakfast and good quality. Proximity to the airport. Service. Size of the room for a family of three.
3614,Michelle,2023-08-12,4.0,Did the job All fine for an airport hotel. Quite pricey.
3615,Susan,2023-08-12,3.5,The convenience of the hotel is the reason we choose to stay. I did not have breakfast but it looked very nice. The location is perfect for the Airport I think that the price of a glass of wine is outrageously expensive. I live in Spain and I could buy 6 bottles of wine for the price of one glass at the hotel. Apart from that our stay was very pleasant and was suitable for our onward flight.
3616,John,2023-08-12,4.5,I had great relaxing stay and a good night's rest before my early morning jounrey I enjoyed the evening meal Singapore Noodles was delicious. In the morning I had an early flight 7.20 am and found the buffet breakfast was great. It had a wide selection of items and catered to a variety of appetites. Queueing and placing an order at the bar could be improved especially these days if there is an app that can help in both placing and paying for an order. Much like Weatherspoons own app. That said the staff were very helpful and the human interaction was appreciated.
3617,Anne,2023-08-11,4.5,Perfect for an airport stop over Location to airport! Nothing
3618,Hannah,2023-08-11,3.5,"good booking in , airport , staff very helpful and always straightforward to check in and out always find it over priced for what it is"
3619,Julian,2023-08-10,4.5,Fantastic welcome at the front desk and clean and comfy room next to the airport. The location to the airport is perfect. The room was clean and modern. The weclome by Alex on the front desk was as welcoming as you could get and really informative. Lovely guy. A little bit pricey but you pay for the location and quality of hotel. It was worth it.
3620,Kathryn,2023-08-10,4.5,Very comfortable but would not normally pay this rate for a hotel. Purely because of location. Staff on reception very pleasant and helpful Very expensive
3621,Susan,2023-08-10,4.0,Stayed to be close to airport & went well Nice choice & good that it's included.
3622,Ruth,2023-08-10,4.5,"Always a pleasant stay, just need to adresss the bar area. The location. Right across the road from airport. Stayed here many times and still the queue at the bar to order drinks and food is ridiculous, up to 30 minute wait they need to come up with a new system."
3623,Cathleen,2023-08-10,4.5,Great for an overnight transit 250m walk to the airport which is great for an early flight and the room was very comfortable Nothing
3624,Katie,2023-08-09,4.0,"Convenient for airport stop over Easy access from airport, quiet Our room was far too small for 3 people - no space for luggage and very little space round bed to walk"
3625,Bridie,2023-08-09,4.0,"Comfortable, modern, relaxing Close proximity to the airport. Nice and modern, friendly staff. That you can’t use cash. Cash is legal tender."
3626,Samantha,2023-08-08,4.0,You feel like you're on holiday as soon as you step inside! Comfortable rooms and delicious breakfast. Super convenient for the airport. It's a little pricey and a bath would be good.
3627,Ann,2023-08-08,4.0,Excellent for overnight airport hotel Well placed for airport and bus station and very comfortable beds No usb charging points
3628,Chris,2023-08-08,4.0,Very good How clean the room was and how big it was for the money. Good sized sofa in room An airport hotel people use to catch early flights but they don't serve hot breakfast until 0600
3629,Lucy,2023-08-08,4.0,Very good Spacious and clean Staff very friendly and helpful Windows faced other rooms. This meant curtains had to be drawn almost always
3630,Mary,2023-08-07,4.0,Overall as expected and ideal location Location ideal for an early flight. The staff were very helpful especially at checkout when I experienced difficulty in finding a trolley as I had a lot of luggage. The receptionist went above and beyond to help me. It was quite pricey for the type of accommodation
3631,Jeremy,2023-08-07,4.0,Very good Clean and comfortable and close to check in for early morning flight.
3632,Neil,2023-08-06,4.5,"Convenient, very good quality hotel within 100m of the arrivals gate Great location. VERY quiet in spite of being on the airport. Good cooked breakfast buffet. Friendly late night reception staff. Nothing."
3633,Elaine,2023-08-06,4.0,"Perfect for a late flight home Convenient to the airport The sofa bed was very difficult to get in and out of, due to the metal frame protruding from the bed. Very easy to catch your leg"
3634,Thomas,2023-08-06,4.0,Convenient Convenient Nothing
3635,Arthur,2023-08-06,4.0,Good all round hotel shame about additional parking charge Breakfast was great room was excellent although a little pricey very close to airport which we could walk to Extra cost of £14.00 to park the car overnight
3636,Lynn,2023-08-05,4.5,Chose the hotel because of location for early flight. Met all expeditions and standards very good. Close to airport. Staff at Reception exceptional. Alex and Tom.
3637,Theresa,2023-08-05,4.0,Enjoyed the comfort of the room and the pillows were wonderful to sleep on . Quick and easy access from the airport. Lovely comfortable beds and lovely bathroom. We were very disappointed that there were no face flannels in our bathroom. We had to wash with the corner of one of the hand towels. We were amazed that there was a carpenter doing work in the sitting area of the restaurant when we went down to breakfast in the morning. Didn’t expect to have to listen to someone banging into the seat frames that he was installing in the seating area of the restaurant. Also we thought that the £14.50 parking charges were extortionate just for 1 nights parking. We didn’t check in to the hotel until the early hours of the morning.
3638,Margaret,2023-08-04,4.5,Comfortable and convenientl for airport Staff were helpful & friendly. Room was clean & comfortable. Breakfast was perfect for an early morning start Nothing
3639,Mark,2023-08-04,4.0,Recommended. Close proximity to the airport. Within walking distance. Excellent staff all round. The choice of food. But this is a minor gripe.
3640,Moira,2023-08-04,4.0,"Very good Very comfortable rooms. Accessible room with the adjoining room was perfect for our needs Breakfast was a little disappointing - it seemed like a good range but toaster didn't toast properly, horrible scrambled eggs, syrup for waffles didn't flow etc etc"
3641,Robert,2023-08-03,4.5,Was short stay but staff and presentation was very good Room very clean and look good well presented. Bed was nice and comfortable with lovely bedding. Breakfast was nice and tasty with plenty of choice. There was nothing I disliked
3642,Rebecca,2023-08-03,4.0,Very good Very clean and tidy Great location for airport departure and arrival Choice at breakfast was v v good Quietness of rooms Shower was Lovley and nice shower gel and hand soap Just thought the parking could have been included in the price
3643,Charlotte,2023-08-01,4.0,Very good Location and staff excellent. Rooms very clean and spacious. Pillows are awful!
3644,Paul,2023-08-01,3.5,No nonsense and a step from departure gates Location!! Utilitarian
3645,Laura,2023-08-01,4.0,Delivered where easyJet failed! Needed a room for the night after flight was cancelled. Being right at the airport it was convenient. Room was clean comfortable and welcomed after sitting in the airport for hours. Reception staff were patient and helpful with myself and the rest of the weary and disgruntled easyJet customers. Nothing. The hotel was great.
3646,Paul,2023-08-01,4.5,"excellent all round modern, clean, good food and drink and excellent staff could have done with spare pillows in rooms"
3647,Gerry,2023-08-01,4.0,"Very good Location, breakfast , quiet room"
3648,Anna,2023-07-31,4.0,"Location is good, but... It is SO convenient to be able to walk to the terminal if you're dropping someone off for a 4am check-in. The food is not great. Breakfast was especially disappointing - really terrible coffee, no bacon, rock hard (yesterdays?) croissants. At almost £200 a night for B&B, it was a shock to then also pay £14 for overnight parking (reduced from £45!!)."
3649,Gavin,2023-07-30,4.0,"The perfect stay over before an early flight! Location, comfort of the room and the quality of the food. The coffee at breakfast. I’d be prepared to pay more for a proper espresso!"
3650,Sarah,2023-07-30,3.5,"Good Stayed the night before an early morning departure. Easy to find on arrival to the airport via taxi. We didn't eat at the restaurant for dinner. Check in process was relatively straightforward. Staff at checkin and checkout were very helpful. Breakfast was served from early in the morning which was great and plenty of choice and food for everyone. No queues at the bar or restaurant at breakfast. The room was very quiet and couldn't hear any plane noise or people moving about in the corridors or rooms which was great. Would recommend to anyone with an early flight and that doesn't want the hassle of Bristol traffic in the morning The bar staff were disorganised - couldn't find items on the till, didn't seem to know their drinks menu, randomly selecting sizes of drinks etc. But overall the stay was good."
3651,Johnston,2023-07-30,4.0,Staff always friendly and welcoming. Hotel facilities always to high standard Location ideal for stay over for early flight. Access to parking and airport within easy walking distance All good
3652,Matthew,2023-07-30,4.0,"Nice hotel but got locked in the bathroom Great location, I like that we could get breakfast very early. The lock on the bathroom door didn't work properly. I got locked in the bathroom and couldn't get out. The door locked but I couldn't unlock it. Luckily my wife was able to open the door from the outside, but I'm not sure I would have got out if I had been travelling alone."
3653,Catherine,2023-07-30,4.0,Perfect for airport stay Location excellent for airport Breakfast is very tired. Needs fresh products.

3658,La,2023-07-28,4.5,A good night's sleep The location is the best bit about the hotel. I stay here every time I fly into Bristol airport. It's so convenient. A good night's sleep is certain in the hotel. The staff are friendly. No. It was all good.
3659,Julia,2023-07-28,4.0,"Very good The room,the staff, lovely big shower very comfortable. Restaurant lovely the breakfast superb. I didn't like the fact that although reception were aware of needing assistance from airport staff to collect me I had to keep pestering them to give me an answer from assistance and they arrived at least an hour late.also couldn't get TV to work with remote that was there.also an alarm went off at 3 a.m and reception brought in a ladder to sort it .apart from was ok"

3662,Hector,2023-07-26,4.0,Very good  Doors bang shut if not careful and therefore noisy
3663,Bcn,2023-07-26,4.0,"Good location for the airport The location was good as we were meeting a friend flying in to the airport. It was an hour drive to the Cotswolds which we planned to explore. I found the hotel very overpriced. It was one of the most expensive hotels on our trip and was nothing extraordinary. There was a big variety of food at the breakfast. The room was ok, nothing special. The staff were fairly friendly but nothing special either."
3664,Penny,2023-07-26,4.5,Great hotel with the loveliest staff Great location and great facilities. The gentleman at the reception was exceptionally helpful and considerate of our needs as a big family; it was clear he went above and beyond to ensure our rooms were as close together as possible. My sibling was also offered an emergency dental kit when they forgot to pack their toothbrush. It was a lovely stay all in all. It’s a shame there’s no hot breakfast until 6AM and we had to leave before that. The continental breakfast available was lovely though.
3665,Amy,2023-07-25,4.5,"Only stayed for 1 night but it was comfortable Breakfast was nice, good selection. Nice size bed. Cleanliness needs a little attentive to the shower."

3668,Joe,2023-07-24,3.5,"Facilities really nice, food terrible and price very expensive for just the night. Room was big, clean and was no noise. Good wasn’t the best, me and girlfriend had food night before there wasn’t many gluten free options for her and my meal was very bad had a burger and might be one of the worst ones I’ve ever had, breakfast in the morning was ok, for the price of one night staying there I would think the food would be much better and night time food wasn’t included so had to pay for that."
3669,Rachid,2023-07-24,4.0,Very good Praticable for an early flight Parking
3670,Colm,2023-07-23,3.5,"Nothing too exciting but nice staff and food was fairly decent. General airport hotel style., ie bland. I was VERY disappointed that we had to pay extra for parking for 1 night after already paying an extra £20 for my dog that slept on the floor"

3675,Marie,2023-07-21,4.5,"Superb Convenient location for flying from Bristol, confortable room and good breakfast"
3676,Guy,2023-07-21,3.5,"An overpriced airport hotel for an overnight stay! Basic accommodation but lovely staff! It is functional but totally overpriced! As an airport hotel, the staff are extremely helpful. The parking charges for leaving car overnight before departing from Bristol airport are outrageous. Parking charges in hotel car park. Basic accommodation. Cleanliness needs improving."
3677,Johnny,2023-07-20,4.5,Did the job well. Near airport Not have a small cooler/fridge
3678,Jenny,2023-07-20,4.0,It’s ok but could do better Lovely styled hotel. Great location for airport Food menu really poor. Staff were slow at serving.

3680,Wendy,2023-07-19,4.5,"Very comfortable, convenient stay. Excellent choice of continental breakfast for 4 a.m. start! Staff very efficient and helpful. Morning call delivered as arranged. (Very important) Location of hotel ideal for our needs. Very comfortable beds with ‘down’ filled pillows. Car parking would be expensive for long stay."
3681,Ian,2023-07-19,4.5,Take off from Bristol Airport Breakfast Room Location perfect for Bristol Airport
3682,Wilkins,2023-07-19,4.0,"Lovely but slightly marred by my cut thumb.= The beds were the most memorable. Very comfortable, good quality bedding and a lovely nights sleep. The restaurant. We enjoyed the basic menu and the setting with the lovely bar. However, the cleaning left a lot to be desired as I cut my right thumb on a sharp piece of glass that was down the seam of my seat. I ran my hand down the seam and felt a sharp sting. I reported to the staff and they filled out an accident report and provided me with blue plaster and antiseptic spray. They apologised, removed the glass but didnt even offer a glass of wine by way of apology."
3683,Glen,2023-07-19,3.5,Great location food was good bed was hard drinks expensive taxi’s extortionate Located on the airport Bed was hard Drinks were expensive Taxi to other venues were extortionate
3684,Darren,2023-07-19,3.5,Just as expected. Clean with friendly staff. Food was excellent Hotel was clean. Beds were comfy. Although the bed itself was comfy. The pillows were awful. Woke up sore.
3685,Cecil,2023-07-18,4.5,"Superb Location is great if you are flying. 5 minutes walk from the terminal. Breakfast is a bit basic, Choice is limited."
3686,Elizabeth,2023-07-16,3.5,Good Location and cleanliness. Good facilities. Bed was very uncomfortable and room expensive.
3687,Andrew,2023-07-15,4.5,My review The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was both plentiful and very tasty. Nothing springs to mind.
3688,Julia,2023-07-15,4.0,"Could be cheaper for a one night stay,leaving very early in the morning. But convenient and comforta Convenience to airport. More pricey than last year."

3694,Wish,2023-07-12,4.0,"My Stay at Hilton Enjoy this Hotel as was very convenient & close to the airport. Perfect location. Hotel itself was very clean and modern. The room itself was great as it had everything u need. Very comfortable bed and nice bathroom. No noise of the airport which was a bonus. Also the staff where Friendly and kindly hold are luggage for us so could have a day out in Bristol. I sorry to say that theirs a few things that disappointed me. One was the cost of the room for one night £175 which is expensive. Another thing that wasn't the best is the breakfast, I was so disappointed with it, considering what I paid. The full English was a big disappointment, no fry eggs, sausage where discussing, so was the scrambled eggs, bread too. Also the coffee was out of a machine, I could go on. Please sort it out, I wanted to complain but didn't have time as had to go."
3695,David,2023-07-12,4.0,Did the job but no great experience Convenient for airport and advance check in of luggage Early morning departure. At 4am no coffee unless paid for despite breakfast included in price. Flight departure at 6.30 meant no time to have anything.
3696,Helen,2023-07-11,3.5,"This hotel seemed less good than on previous stays while the price had increased. Pleasant room, comfortable and very convenient location. Great that they have provision for a help yourself continental breakfast for those who have to leave very early to catch a flight but the choice was limited. Evening meal quality was very poor with limited choice and smallish portions for the price. Continental buffet breakfast could be improved. Even though we were very early the fresh fruit platter was finished and had not been replenished.Generally there was limited choice."
3697,John,2023-07-11,4.5,"Excellent place to stay for an early flight. Staff could not have been more friendly. Nice clean comfortable room, decen Less than 5 minute walk to airport"
3698,Jade,2023-07-11,4.5,Great Friendly staff and the breakfast is lovely
3699,Michael,2023-07-11,3.5,"Nice clean hotel with well appointed rooms and good breakfast We booked a late check in and staff were were expecting us (at gone midnight). Breakfast was great, wide choice of food including vegetarian and vegan options. Room was good but the bed was far too firm. Bathroom was good. Super convenient for getting to the airport terminal, which is why you stay there! Bed was far too firm."
3700,David,2023-07-11,3.5,"Airport stay for early flight out and late back, adequet but cheap and cheerful would be better position for Bristol Airport. Price"
3701,David,2023-07-11,4.0,"Airport stay for early flight out and late back, adequet but cheap and cheerful would be better Airport hotel, excellent location for Bristol airport, rather expensive. Price, breakfast but as had early start not able to have but paid for."
3702,Lorraine,2023-07-11,4.0,Good for what we required Location to airport Nothing
3703,Catherine,2023-07-11,3.5,Room good restaurant more like a mid level cafe Convenience to airport. Easy walk Ripoff parking charges. Not even a drop off point for luggage. A £7 parking fee for 20 minutes unloading and getting into our room before taking the rental car back is beyond a joke.
3704,Celia,2023-07-10,4.5,"Perfect end to our holiday Location, comfort and friendly,helpful staff Nothing"
3705,Steven,2023-07-09,3.5,Good Location to air port Drinks to expensive
3706,Emma,2023-07-09,4.5,"Superb The staff at this hotel were absolutely faultless. I arrived after a long journey and they were very friendly and welcoming, which was a huge relief as I was travelling alone. The room was spotless and spacious and the breakfast offering was fresh and tasty. The price! It is such a convenient location when flying from Bristol, but it is overpriced for what it is and that is the only thing that puts me off returning."
3707,Davina,2023-07-09,4.0,Very good Bedrooms quiet which is important when you have to get up early for flight A bottle of water in room would be nice
3708,Natalie,2023-07-08,4.0,Pleasant and happy stay Gym facilities and very modern throughout. Couldn’t hear the aeroplanes Pillows weren’t very comfortable Tv didn’t have Netflix
3709,Catherine,2023-07-08,4.5,Very comfortable hotel but expensive. Very comfortable and quiet rooms. Restaurant was good and affordable. Convenient location. It’s very expensive for what it is. You are paying for the convenience of being located on the airport. Only you can decide if it is worth it. I had an early flight so the extra sleep and less stress was worth it this time but if I had a flight at a reasonable time I wouldn’t consider it.
3710,Dawn,2023-07-08,4.0,"Served it’s purpose well Location, ease of getting to departure terminal, food was ok with multiple options depending on time of day, rooms clean, email communication was quick Originally rang the venue to ask a question about booking in times as had had a flight cancelled at Gatwick so would be arriving very late, receptionist couldn’t answer the simple question of if they operated a 24 hour booking in desk? And after being put on hold for ages the call was disconnected, as I was already in a very stressful situation this wasn’t good"
3711,Jane,2023-07-08,4.5,"Makes an early start at Bristol Airport more bearable. Location next to terminal, size of room comfortable bed, quiet. Helpful staff. Departures listed and updated in hotel No flannels in the bathroom. Tea & coffee limited (no biscuits which would have been nice)"
3712,Kay,2023-07-07,3.5,Alright We ate in the restaurant but was very ordinary The plug sockets on the head board didn’t work
3713,Cherry,2023-07-07,4.0,Comfortable clean stay between flights. Excellent receptionist Proximity to airport Nothing
3714,Alison,2023-07-07,4.0,Very good Chose the hotel due to early flight from Bristol Airport. Can't get any closer than over the road! The cost is a little high for twin room overnight stay as you can't check in before 15.00 and we were out of the room by 4.30 am. 15.00 check in is a bit of a pain. Would be better with an option for an earlier check in.
3715,William,2023-07-07,4.5,Smart modern hotel Smart hotel in the perfect location Price!
3716,Marilyn,2023-07-06,4.5,"Not a cheap 1-night stay but well worth it for the great location & high standard of facilities Very helpful, friendly staff, great food selection at breakfast, lunch & dinner, so handy for accessing Bristol airport - just a short stroll to check-in. Lovely fresh decor in all areas and good-sized rooms. The option of a ground-floor room was a real bonus when travelling with heavy luggage. Room felt quite cold and I was unable to adjust the temperature. Not sure if I was having a 'senior moment' and not pressing the right buttons, but an instruction card for adjusting the heating would have been useful."
3717,James,2023-07-05,4.0,"Quick Didn’t have breakfast as flight was 6 o’clock in the morning. Due to delay only had room for one hour, so quick shower then back to the airport. No delays on flight from Edinburgh."
3718,Ashley,2023-07-05,4.0,"Value, efficiency and convenient.I would have no hesitation to stay again in future Proximity to airport after a late flight Breakfast ..... produce okay but not a fan of cafeteria style"
3719,Frances,2023-07-05,4.0,"Convenient and comfortable Convenient location for our needs. Room was big enough, clean and comfortable. Staff very welcoming and friendly. Nothing to dislike."
3720,Paul,2023-07-04,4.0,"Good pre-flight stop over, comfy bed, slept well :) Everything about the hotel optimised for easy air travel which is perfect. Little bit basic in terms of facilities, but to be honest given target market is basically people sleeping before they fly, I think that’s the right call."
3721,Mary,2023-07-04,4.5,"Superb We had a late flight into the airport so decided to stay over and drive home in the morning. Really glad we did. Room was comfortable, breakfast was good and the walk from the terminal was really short"
3722,Graham,2023-07-03,3.5,"Perfect location, great staff, but quality didn’t match price. Check in, staff friendly. Breakfast was good and so was the supper. When curtains closed in our room you had to put a light on. When sleeping it meant leaving a light on but none were dimmed enough not to keep us awake. The giant mirror in front of the bathroom door reflected the light throughout the room. That comment was for what we didn’t like. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. The bar area had seats which had had their cushions removed so we’re unusable."
3723,Liz,2023-07-03,3.5,"Good Room was very nice, bigger and brighter than I expected. Super handy for the airport, a three minute walk which was brilliant. Breakfast was okay."
3724,Mjbentley,2023-07-02,4.0,Surprising comfortable airport hotel ! Very efficient check in and comfortable rooms for an airport hotel. Very quiet! Food ....again efficient and above normal standards for an airport hotel. No decent decaf coffee!! Bar set up late at night needs attention. Quite a few people were waiting a long time for drinks.
3725,Elizabeth,2023-07-02,4.0,Very good All was good
3726,Sandra,2023-07-02,4.0,"Very good Fantastic for air travel being on the airport door step. We had only two teabags and two coffees and only a sweetner instead of sugar, for the money we paid i don't think it'd hurt to be a little more generous. We did an overnight for flight the next day and had no tea or coffee after break"
3727,Peter,2023-07-02,4.5,"Excellent accommodation for early morning flight, no worries of traffic jams! Location Nothing"
3728,Russell,2023-07-02,3.5,Good Close to airport
3729,David,2023-07-02,4.0,I would book again. Quiet and clean Poor ventilation in the bathroom and the water noises from above the room
3730,Annette,2023-07-02,4.0,Very good  Bed was too hard and could have benefitted from a memory foam mattress
3731,Virginia,2023-07-01,3.5,Great location Location in airport for early flight Breakfast included in stay The hamburger I had was awful
3732,Catherine,2023-07-01,3.5,"Very convenient for the airport terminals Great location, right next to the airport terminal Expensive rooms"
3733,Gary,2023-06-30,4.0,Would be happy to stay there again. Modern and the location. Excellent breakfast and staff working to provide it. Room doors have a tendency to slam shut. Rather disturbing.
3734,Stephen,2023-06-30,4.0,Very good  The sausages weren’t as good as last time tasted different
3735,Vera,2023-06-30,4.5,Recommended Spotless. Rooms nicely equipped. Breakfast that starts at 04:00 is great to catch early planes. No mini fridge in the room.
3736,Matthew,2023-06-29,3.5,"Used as like everyone else as there’s little alternative at airport Only picked due to location to airport and early flight Small room , well used room needs updating."
3737,Christopher,2023-06-29,4.0,"Like i said room and staff were good ,not the evening food/ The room was good ,location good. The breakfast was good but the evening food not good"
3738,Heather,2023-06-29,4.5,Check in was fast and efficient. No table service for bar/food but staff friendly. The location was perfect. The cost of the room was on the pricey side but I guess this is because you have a monopoly.
3739,Tracy,2023-06-29,4.0,Convenient Location. Short walk to terminal
3740,Alan,2023-06-28,4.0,"Good spot on the airport,clean rooms but disappointed in the breakfast, not value for money. The room was fine but the breakfast was 2nd rate,it starts off with good food and then it is let down by the cooking. The breakfast it was so second rate."
3741,Paul,2023-06-28,4.5,"Super, convenient hotel. Very clean hotel. The room was spacious and quiet. Bed was comfortable. Staff were friendly and attentive. We only used the room for a few hours due to arriving at the airport in the early hours and then travelling onward. Didn't get chance to have the breakfast. The experience in booking was very easy online and was easy to amend after an error on my part on booking the wrong day!! More milk in the rooms, please. Could breakfast run a little longer? We arrived at 4am and were very tired after an eight hour journey back to the UK. It was not possible to get down to eat in time."
3742,Paul,2023-06-28,4.0,"Hotel overnight visit Closeness to airport terminal Would have liked a hot breakfast, but due to our flight time only continental offered."
3743,Sandra,2023-06-28,4.0,"Very good The location is perfect, the staff were very helpful, the rooms are extremely comfortable, thank you I would have liked more choice of breakfast, there were few bananas, please have more next time"
3744,Jean,2023-06-27,4.5,Superb Great location
3745,Amanda,2023-06-27,4.0,Great as a stopover before you fly Location Nothing
3746,Lloyd,2023-06-27,4.5,"Excellent, brilliant location for late trips into the airport.  Shower difficult to obtain a good consistent temperature"
3747,Ian,2023-06-26,4.5,Good place to stay before an early flight. Very handy for the airport and helpful that they offer free parking while checking in and dropping luggage (we were parking at the Silver Zone park). As we had an early check-in for our flight we thought we would have to miss breakfast so were pleasantly surprised by the early continental breakfast available.
3748,Isabel,2023-06-26,4.5,"Superb The hotel is right next to the national Express bus stop and to the airport yet we didn't hear any noise whilst we were trying to sleep. The staff were very friendly. The room was spotless, shower was amazing. They also had a selection of games in the lounge area such as 'guess who' and 'battleships'. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The 'on the go' breakfast is NOT very good. It contained an apple, a cereal bar and a croissant. Considering you have breakfast included in the price and no option to remove it, I would consider a better 'on the go' breakfast for people who have early flights. For example, we had to leave the hotel at 4am and the hot breakfast doesn't start until 6/7am. A cold bacon/sandwich sandwich would have been better than a croissant in our opinion."
3749,Kingsley,2023-06-26,4.0,Very good This is the perfect stopover for flights that are either late getting in or early morning. It is right next to the terminal and far exceeded my expectation both with the staff and the facilities.
3750,Sue,2023-06-24,4.0,Have to stay here as no other alternative but very expensive although comfortable. location to airport after late flight. £160 and no water in room. Checking in at 0200 and receptionist more interested in offering us 10% off our next visit. We were tired! No fried eggs at breakfast and not available. Both coffee machines not working properly at breakfast. Can’t offer a parking deal as spaces owned by Bristol airport so whole thing very expensive.
3751,Andrew,2023-06-24,4.5,Excellent Excellent breakfast. Reduce room price per night
3752,Emma,2023-06-24,4.0,It was good apart from no breakfast Could not have any as flying out early. That I paid for breakfast included in the price but you could not provide a cooked breakfast before my early flight. Breakfast should be optional extra in the price as I paid for something that wasn't possible to have.
3753,Elaine,2023-06-23,3.5,"My flight arrived quite late in the evening so it was suitable for that situation. Room was very nice, clean and cool. Very nice helpful staff. Being old I struggled with the journey from terminal to hotel on foot with luggage. Food and drink prices very high and too much self service, given the prices."
3754,Claire,2023-06-22,4.0,Friendly staff and close to the airport proximity to airport restaurant and bar area drinks were expensive
3755,Lara,2023-06-22,4.0,Great nights sleep Very clean and comfortable

3761,Jean-pierre,2023-06-20,3.5,"if food is improved, this will be a much better hotel overall room was practical and clean quality and choice of food was poor"
3762,Michele,2023-06-20,4.0,Unexpected Breakfast fab plenty of choice It was fine bit costly
3763,Catherine,2023-06-20,3.5,"Curate's egg The room was very comfortable and clean. The toiletries in the bathroom were lovely, and the towels were good. The continental breakfast was very poor. The ""orange juice"" was orange squash, there was hardly any food, and the tea was awful. I think perhaps the machine needed properly cleaned."
3764,Yacht-surveyor,2023-06-20,3.5,good for an early flight The location is great but you get wet going to and from the terminal if its raining too expensive
3765,Chris,2023-06-20,3.5,"overnight stay before early flight, very comfy night! very modern look about the place. upto dare decor. evening meal was excellent."
3766,Paul,2023-06-20,4.0,perfect for early flights super convenient for the airport. the staff were so friendly and helpful
3767,Sharon,2023-06-19,3.5,"stayed here after flight cancelled, definitely not worth the £220 for one night stay for solo traveler, location to airport very clean helping courteous staff the price way too expensive"
3768,Stephen,2023-06-19,4.5,Superb Did what it ment to for us. Nothing
3769,Jessica,2023-06-19,4.5,"Just across the airport, a great gym and breakfast buffet to enjoy before heading for the next stop Very short walking distance from the airport and a great gym--they had a Peloton! A bit pricey but you are paying for the convenient location so close to the airport"
3770,Louise,2023-06-18,3.5,Very expensive this year Convenience Restaurant sub standard and low quality. Menu has been the same for years. We always plan to not eat there but tiredness after travelling means we end up eating there.
3771,Su,2023-06-18,4.0,relaxed and comfortable. staff were helpful and friendly close to terminal. clean. helpful staff
3772,Gareth,2023-06-17,4.0,Very good Very convenient from Bristol Airport for a place to stay late at night after a flight from Barcelona. Saved driving straight home. Room nice and Clean. Breakfast was very tasty.

3775,Glenn,2023-06-16,4.0,Good in parts Room and airport was good quick & easy access room was l9vely & comfortable and clean. Breakfast in a bag was poor not much food choice on evening menu plus not accepting cash card only.
3776,Sarah,2023-06-16,3.5,"Great staff and comfort - But the price is just robbery. I stay here every 12 weeks as I have an early flight to travel to work. As usual, the staff, comfort and cleanliness is great. It’s also very convenient having a place to get a drink and a meal on site. THE PRICE! It’s just absolute lunacy! £220 for one night B & B. I know market drivers etc. but there no need to fleece your customers. Unfortunately for us customers there aren’t really any compatible viable options in the locality."
3777,Ernest,2023-06-16,4.5,It did what we wanted. Did not use the breakfast. Room overlooked the dirty washing store.
3778,Linda,2023-06-16,4.5,"Will be booking again next year Excellent location as we had an early flight and very short distance to the departure area. The continental breakfast was good Not being able to be dropped off by the entrance to the hotel, it was a mad scramble to get out of the car at the roadside and we couldn't say goodbye properly to my husband .You have to pay an exorbitant fee to park for a few minutes"
3779,Julie,2023-06-15,4.0,Great location right next to the terminal buildings. The location is amazing! The breakfast was superb! The windows don't open in the rooms. The rooms are small. Could have been a bit cleaner - bleach will take care of mould straight away!
3780,Jill,2023-06-15,4.0,Comfortable stay but felt it was a bit overpriced Location excellent for the airport. Good bus service from centre of Bristol.
3781,Anthony,2023-06-15,3.5,All good - need invoice sent to me please Location and food Fire alarm and evacuation at 4am
3782,Gary,2023-06-15,4.5,good Closeness to airport
3783,Matthew,2023-06-15,3.5,Overnight airport hotel stay in Bristol Clean and comfortable. What is expected from a Hilton hotel. Very early breakfast (as of 4am) - perfect for early travellers. 10 minutes walk to Bristol Airport. A more varied menu choice from hotel restaurant. Dining area just next to main reception and it looked very busy to me.
3784,Stephen,2023-06-15,4.5,Thank you very much to all the staff at the Hampton by Hilton Everything was good the staff were really friendly and helpful the breakfast was good the room was clean we will be staying with you again thank you 😀
3785,Jodi,2023-06-15,4.5,"Convienient, comfortable and a great breakfast. Very close to the terminal. Nice room, bathroom, tv, sofa. Good wifi. Free, unlimited brekkie was excellent with lots of choices - just make sure you get there before it closes."
3786,Peter,2023-06-14,4.0,"Good hotel, very convenient location, and you have to pay for that. The hotel is very convenient for a very early departure time from the airport (we live two hours drive away). The welcome was very friendly, and it was easy to find our way around. It’s also very quiet. It’s an expensive stay (£200 for the night), but the only hotel that allows you to walk to the airport departure gates."
3787,Amanda,2023-06-14,4.5,For a last minute change to my plans it was a good place to stay This was a last minute booking as was supposed to fly out the same day but things didn't go to plan and I needed somewhere to stay for the night. The room was lovely; the staff were excellent and very helpful; and the food (both evening and breakfast) were to a high standard. I have to admit that I don't stay in hotels and the price did seem excessive- until I got there and actually saw the place. It was still expensive but I could see why.
3788,Geraldine,2023-06-13,3.5,"very convenient but expensive for a v short night proximity to airport I chose to book a room through the app, and get a digital key. reception then said they need to change my room. digital key arrived 90mins after I got into the room"

3790,Lauren,2023-06-13,3.5,"Good for being close to the airport Great location close to the airport. The hallways need the windows open, very hot walking up to our room carrying heavy luggage. The pillows are rubbish, not a very comfy night sleep with the pillows"

3792,John,2023-06-13,4.5,"Very pleased with our first stay at this hotel and will use again. Conveniently located to the bus stop and the Airport's departure entrance point. Room was clean with comfortable bedding. Excellent toilet/shower facilities. A good selection of cooked and continental breakfasts were available together with fruit juices/tea/coffee, etc. Very pleasant and helpful Reception Staff. Not much ....but the climb from the Hotel to the Airport's Departure point proved to be a bit of a challenge to my ageing legs."
3793,Amy,2023-06-13,4.0,"Quick stop over Right on airport, lovely staff, quiet rooms, and great breakfast options for earlier check outs. Our bathroom was an assessible bathroom, which I wouldn't really mind, but the water wasn't draining properly, and it seeped out of the bathroom. Bar meals a little basic."
3794,Laura,2023-06-13,4.5,"Great location, attentive and friendly staff and excellent buffet breakfast. Recommended Hotel easily accessed from Bristol Airport, even with suitcases/prams down the accessible slopes. Staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. We arrived at 12.30am and requested a cot. Two staff members met us when we arrived at the room and set it up very quickly so we could get the kids to bed. Room and rest of hotel was clean and tidy. The breakfast buffet included in the price the next morning was excellent. Great selection and coffee was good quality. Hilton Honours allowed us to extend checkout until 2pm for free, which was great as our flight wasn't until 3.30pm. Once we made the pull-out bed back into a sofa, the room was sufficient size for us to stay in for a few hours. Overall great stay, would highly recommend. We were a family of 4 (2 adults and 1 child and 1 infant), so selected a Queen room with pull out bed and cot. Room was a little snug once the pull out bed and cot were out, but this was fine for a 1 night stay. The next day we folded the bed back to a sofa which gave us enough room."

3806,Aileen,2023-06-09,3.5,"Over priced Perfectly situated right beside the terminal building with covered walkway for some of the way . Clean , comfortable and everything you need for an airport stay . The cost was ridiculous . Overpriced and taking advantage of the monopoly they have at this airport . We arrived at 1230am were up at 5 and it cost £220 ."

3811,Deborah,2023-06-07,4.0,"Excellent location, comfort and service. Very comfortable beds which were hugely appreciated after a very long day travelling, and arriving at 3 am. Good blackout so not disturbed in the morning, and able to check out at 12 rather than 11 am. Excellent breakfast, very relaxed environment. Although it seemed expensive the convenience adjacent to the airport and the comfort offered made it worthwhile. Reception was a little slow, as the receptionist was perhaps inexperienced and needed assistance with the guests ahead of us. This was frustrating for us as we were desperate to get to our room!"
3812,Martha,2023-06-07,4.5,"a relaxing nights sleep after a late flight The location within walking distance to the airport is super handy. the room was very clean, beds very comfy, shower good. breakfast could have had a few more choices eg fried eggs, more pastry items like pan au chocolate (considering the price).

3828,Colin,2023-06-02,4.0,"Ideal for our needs with an early morning flight. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the airport terminal (up hill, although I understand there is a bus service if needed). Check in was quick and efficient, our room was clean and suited our needs. As we had an early flight the continental breakfast was welcome and had good choices, the hot food starts at 6am."

3836,Janet,2023-05-31,3.5,As a couple it’s pleasant but taking a grandchild to stay in the room too space becomes too compressed airport access proximity Sink layout too far away for a tall five year old to use without being lifted up plus room size when sofa bed made up isn’t good
3837,Beverley,2023-05-30,3.5,Good Liked how close to the airport it is and the facilities available. I thought a lot of the things where over priced for quantity especially the parking which I know is owned by the airport unfortunately and of I I'd known this before hand I would of added the extra day on the airport parking
3838,Margaret,2023-05-30,4.5,Flying visit! Excellent location for the airport We spent less than 12 hours in the hotel because we arrived late one evening for a very early flight the next day. However it served its purpose well and could not have been nearer the airport. We even had a grab and go breakfast at 4am nothing

3851,Paul,2023-05-26,3.5,"Comfort and convenient stay but abusive tarifs. The comfort and location of the property were very good. The price being charged is abusing it's monopoly position of being the only hotel on the airport. The matter is made worse by only offering a tarif including breakfast, when many of its clients will only stay there due to a very early check-in time and not able to consume the breakfast, (4am in our case)."
3852,Eric,2023-05-26,4.0,"Very comfortable hotel in an ideal location for the airport It is ideal for an overnight stay, either before your flight or on your return."

3854,Elizabeth,2023-05-26,4.5,"Nice hotel, convenient especially for very late arrivals. Expensive comfortable bed, pillows and duvet, nice room this time with Queen beds. Night receptionist was excellent. All looked very cared for. Hotel full yet no noise disturbance. PLEASE, more lighting to the hotel, especially via the ramp, also, make the hotel sign bolder from the airport approach, and indicate which way the steps are and which way the ramp is please. Breakfast spread good other than the ‘traditional English’ No tomatoes, beans, black pudding(!) and on request for poached egg, was turned down and told nicely, “only scrambled egg”"

3857,Roland,2023-05-25,4.5,"Comfortable and convenient stopover hotel for the airport Comfortable room, excellent breakfast and very helpful staff. Ideal when arriving on a very late plane and not wanting an onward drive that same night. Finding our way from the arrivals terminal, although it was very close, to the hotel was unnecessarily difficult due to poor signposting of the route that avoided steps. We mentioned this to the hotel who said that the signage, unfortunately, was the responsibility of the airport."
3858,Dika,2023-05-25,4.0,"Great place to stay if you get in late. Right next to airport No fried eggs for breakfast, only scrambled (yuck)."
3859,Tim,2023-05-25,3.5,Adequate and good overnight stop off It’s not a top notch hotel but it’s perfect for an afternoon ver night stop before flying out. Food was ok nothing special but adequate. For what we wanted it was ok May be better selection of beers on tap!

The airport is easy to access and very convenient. The room had everything we needed for a one night stay. We ate at the hotel in the evening and the system and the food was very good. A very good selection for breakfast. We had an early start so we were unable to have a cooked breakfast, which we would have had given the option."
3862,Danny,2023-05-24,4.5,"Airport hotel. Position, very easy to get to airport. Nice breakfast. Room good. For me the mattress was too hard, but I have a back problem so would probably be ok for most people."
3863,Helen,2023-05-24,4.0,"An expensive but convenient and comfortable option for the airport Very convenient for the airport (on site). Easy access with or without a car. The room was quiet, spacious clean and comfortable with a well equipped en suite. The restaurant provided a range of food and drink options. The staff were helpful and polite The price.

3866,Frank,2023-05-23,3.5,"A one night stop Location just outside airport entrance. Choice of meals was reasonable and the curry of the day was good. Rooms starting to look tired. Bed settee was opened as a bed but there were only two of us staying. Carpet under the bed did not look as if it had seen a hoover in a long time. No access to fresh air, window locked so had to use air conditioning. The continental breakfast was very poor with little choice."
3867,Vivien,2023-05-23,4.5,Everything went very smoothly and no complaints. All good and the cleanliness was excellent. Nothing only maybe a fridge in the room.

3890,Terence,2023-05-11,3.5,"Adequate for purpose. Room was comfortable if a little cramped but most importantly was clean and adequate for one night stay before flight. Restaurant was more like self-service works canteen, tables were not laid-up and any semblance of intimacy was non-existent. Prices were not 'over the top' but certaintly more than adequate for the meal presented. Lack of acceptance of payment by cash is a very annoying trend which I feel is totally unwarranted and most definitely not 'customer- friendly'."
3891,Mathew,2023-05-11,4.0,Very good Perfect location right next to the airport for catching a flight. Sound proofing amazing. Couldn't hear any planes Breakfast was only cold but I was up at 4am. Hot breakfast served later but paid the same

3902,David,2023-05-08,4.5,An excellent chilled out one night stay in the Hilton at Bristol airport. The location was very close to airport departures. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable. You could not hear any of the planes taking off or landing which helped. The early morning breakfast was tasty with plenty of choice. And express checkout did what it said on the tin. Hotel to departures pulling suitcases along the walkway took less than 10 minutes. There was nothing to dislike about the hotel or its facilities.
3903,Jill,2023-05-07,4.5,A lovely stay Very good Nothing to dislike.
3904,Laura,2023-05-07,4.0,Ideal for an early flight from Bristol airport Location was excellent to catch an early flight in the morning. Excellent food at the Bistro in the hotel. The room was very small for 3 adults and the sofa bed wasn’t comfortable.

We were offered a 'take away' breakfast when I explained that I was leaving very early in the morning but we didn't take it as we were leaving before the restaurant opened. The location was very close to the airport. Expensive. I have stayed at hotels on site at Gatwick for a fraction of the price. It was a better hotel but not worth four times the price."

Lots of sockets. Bathroom sink situated quite far back so big leaning required to be over sink. Picky maybe. An extending shaver type mirror would be useful. Again picky though.
3939,Cathy,2023-04-21,3.5,Ideal for Bristol airport. Less than 5 minutes walk to the airport. it seemed a little busy & chaotic when we arrived but it is an airport!

Whilst the selection of bar food was limited in terms of offering - the food was good quality & reasonably priced. Breakfast - excellent selection and hot. Location is outstanding - a 2 minute walk to departures. There was nothing that I felt was unsatisfactory - only minor gripes were the air conditioning/heating was loud (had to switch off) and the double bed was close to the wall - so difficult to get out on this side."
3948,Gaetano,2023-04-17,4.5,As I expected Location early breakfast close to airport Food

3951,Bwh,2023-04-16,4.0,"Excellent airport hotel Our flight to Bristol was very delayed, and we didn't arrive until 230am. I called the hotel to warn them, and they couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. Comfortable, efficient room, and very decent breakfast."

3955,Helena,2023-04-15,4.5,"Exceeded our expectations This hotel exceeded our expectations. It was spotless, rooms were large and airy and the bed was so comfortable. The decor was super . 24 hour bar a great idea. Staff were FANTASTIC and could not have been more helpful. They bent over backwards to accommodate what we needed for a disabled person and made our airport stay far better than we imagined. We will definitely stay here again for our next flight . Only one thing we did not like was the continental breakfast, it was basically croissants , yoghurt and old fruit. It was really appreciated that it was open at 4 am but the choice of food and quality could have been a lot better ."

3958,Alan,2023-04-14,4.0,"Grateful for hotel, would stay again.2 Location very convenient, staff welcoming and helpful. Room a little cramped and shower a concern as I am disabled and floor slippery. A safety mat on shower floor, a change in bedroom arrangement."
3959,Giada,2023-04-14,4.0,"Very good Very convenient for early flights as it is right next to the airport. Good and clean facilities. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is excellent quality, but most items don't get restocked, so make sure you get there fairly early to have plenty of choice. Lovely hotel, but very overpriced for what it is. Unfortunately there is no real competition around, as it's the only hotel at walking distance from the airport. The price seems particularly high if you think that most guests (like us) only stay for a few hours, checking-in late evening and checking-out early morning. The sofa bed in the family room was very thin and uncomfortable. It would probably be ok for a child, but not great for an adult."
3960,Karen,2023-04-14,4.5,Superb Warm welcome despite being early hours after a delayed flight

3967,Claire,2023-04-11,4.0,"Very convenient and comfortable stay Staff on check in were very friendly, room was good size, clean and comfy. Good soundproofing, barely heard an outside noise all night and slept well. Didn’t experience other facilities as left very early in the morning but so convenient to stay right next to airport and get a good nights sleep before an early flight. Bed was quite squeeky when I rolled over, and just wish the price was a little lower."
3968,James,2023-04-11,4.0,"Stayed twice and enjoyed both times. Only down side was the pouring rain on both occasions Position of hotel on airport for easy access , room and breakfast very good, Staff friendly and attentive including early morning call.

3986,Heidi,2023-04-04,4.0,"Had a great stay, it’s all very easy, looking forward to staying at the Hampton again. I love that it’s only a few minutes walk from the Arrivals at Bristol Airport. It’s so handy if you are coming in on a late flight or leaving on an early morning flight. Staff are friendly and the breakfast hours are great if you’re on an early flight. There’s a 24 hour reception. I found the room slightly cold and the bathroom floor very cold. It would be lovely if cloth slippers could be provided to help with this. It would help if there were more gluten free options at breakfast and things were clearly labelled for allergies, etc. Thanks."

Staff were excellent, hotel is very conveniently located with a short covered walk to the terminal and the multi-storey car park is right next door. Dinner was really nice and while I cannot comment on the official breakfast because we had to be in the airport before it started, a really nice touch they provided a small breakfast bag which was perfect to tie the kids over until we could get on the plane. We had a double room with a sofa bed which was perfect for the kids, really comfy stay. Would definitely recommend for a nice layover or for making an early morning flight more convenient."

Next time I would take the breakfast from the early morning buffet. Room was lovely but little pieces of glass by the bathroom door and by the side of the bed. take away breakfast needs to improve. I wa unable to find out if there was a restaurant for evening meal before we arrived and was unaware they have their own parking on site."

Good to know there's a faster convenient way to get to the hotel. Breakfast closed up a little early for late check in guest. Whilst I understand that 10am was the last call. Perhaps the hotel can look into late check in guest perhaps offering a room service breakfast or a later time like 10.30am specifically for us

On airport so no drama on the morning of our flight - just a short walk. The price is a bit high and it would be better to give a choice of available airport car parking with the booking - not everyone wants outdoor parking in the winter.

4035,Joanne,2023-03-12,4.0,"Perfect hotel for when you flight is cancelled and your next flight is the next night! My flight from Bristol was cancelled due to snow so as I had stayed at The Hampton previously, I instantly knew to book quickly as there was going to be a lot of people needing rooms that night. The hotel is the perfect location as its just across the road from the airport. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, which I don’t remember being the case on my first visit. I had dinner in the hotel and I have to say that it was better than I expected and not a bad price. Breakfast was a good selection. I do think the rooms are expensive but I get that you are paying for the convenience of being so close to the airport, plus being the closest, they can charge those prices and still get the guests."
4036,Alexandra,2023-03-12,4.0,"Handy stay for the airport As close as you can be to the airport very handy. Food was reasonable, comfortable stay food room. Freindly staff.

Waffles were fun to make. Quality of the food we ate was good. We didn't go for a cooked breakfast. Bathroom was excellent, loved the shower. Very comfortable bed and lovely soft pillows. Didn't hear any planes! Good size room which was very clean and ordered. We appreciated the lit pathway from the airport to the hotel after our late flight arrival."
4083,Yacht-surveyor,2023-02-26,4.0,OK its a good option if you have an early flight quite a long check in wait
4084,Roger,2023-02-25,3.5,"Excellent for early flights Breakfast served at 4AM! Excellent if you need to catch the 6AM Flight Restaurant didn't take orders at table.

4089,Huw,2023-02-24,4.0,Excellent - will definitely come back and will probably choose Bristol airport again as a result. All excellent. Thought equal opportunities policy for staff was very refreshing. Breakfast was outstanding. Was encouraged to sign up for Hilton Honours via the messaging system on Booking.com but when I checked in I was advised that I wouldn’t get the points BECAUSE it was through Booking.com Woyid have appreciated a bit more transparency on that front.

The hotel was in a perfect location for me as I needed to be close to the airport for work. Great connection by bus to Bristol city too. I enjoyed the coffee during breakfast a lot, breakfast in general was nice, breakfast area was also clean and staff was ready to help anyone out where needed. The staff at the hotel in general are very friendly and ready to answer any questions. The room was refurbished, was spacious and had all items one could need during a stay. The bed linnen had some area with a glue-like deposit on it which should have been picked up by the person preparing the room and it should have been replaced. I managed to get the deposit off myself though and it didn't bother me anymore."

4100,Janet,2023-02-20,4.0,Very good Easy walk to terminal early morning. Grab and go bag for breakfast before restaurant opened was a really good idea.
4101,Mary,2023-02-20,3.5,"Paying for location convenience right by hotel For a relatively expensive hotel it all felt a bit basic. Even loo roll was cheap - whole vibe no better than a Travelodge but three times the price. Queuing to order and pay for very basic evening meal menu seems at odds with the price per night. Staff all friendly and helpful though, and location excellent."
4102,Michaela,2023-02-19,3.5,"Good Very clean. Nice room. Good size. Nice bar/restaurant Lack of fridge, no water to drink in the room, and also nothinf complimentary. Very uncomfortable pillows...as too soft. Overall is good but with a price of 170 per night i was expect something little more."

4107,Kasia,2023-02-18,4.0,"Super friendly hotel This hotel is close to the airport, very quiet and friendly - Krystyna at the front desk was superb helpful! We only stayed for 1 night but had an amazing evening and night at the hotel. Our flight was at 6am so we only had cold breakfast (bread with butter and cheese) as anything hot is served after 6am. Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely come back. Hot breakfast to be served earlier and fridge in the room."

4117,Diana,2023-02-14,4.0,"Very good Very helpful and friendly reception staff. Good downstairs area to eat and drink, I enjoyed seeing what was going on. The beds are a bit hard and on the little tea tray there was only enough milk for one mug of tea/coffee each."
4118,Gemma,2023-02-14,4.0,"Good Breakfast was excellent, the bed very comfy and staff helpful. The room was adequately clean, although the carpet could do with a bit more attention. The air con or heating was quite noisy. Generally it was as I expected, and I was satisfied with my stay"

4124,Patricia,2023-02-13,4.5,"Overall it adequately served the purpose for which it was required. Would use again if necessary. The room itself was comfortable and the beds were a good size. There was a nice big vanity mirror with good lighting. Found breakfast a little disappointing, maybe because it was exactly the same as we had been experiencing for all our breakfasts on holiday. The bacon was tough and a little hard to cut. The sliding door to the bathroom in our room was very difficult to move and it took all of my strength to open it."
4125,Ashley,2023-02-13,4.5,Superb Comfort and convenience
4126,Geoffrey,2023-02-13,4.5,Convenient and comfortable. Location unbeatable if you have an early flight. Just a very short walk across to the terminal. Good to be able to get a Continental breakfast from very early too. Super comfy beds. Nothing really.

4141,Wayne,2023-02-08,3.5,"Decent airport hotel Hotel is OK in general. Decent rooms and food was OK too.

Like every other Airport hotel, its not the cheapest but you pay for the convenience, and its modern."
4142,Heather,2023-02-08,3.5,"We stayed before collecting a hire car next day so had limited choice. Pleasant reception staff.Twin room better use of space than the doubles. Room heating worked. breakfast ok.Short walk from terminal to hotel. Bar staff refused to accept cash for dinner order ""company policy is card only"". Tough on those without a card, we won't eat there again for dinner. Catering style was canteen- order at bar, collect your own cutlery, food delivered to table, not a great experience."

The staff in the bar and food area too were very nice. Food was easy to order and quick to arrive. As for the room, very comfortable and quiet too which was just what I needed before an early flight.

The free one hour stay for drop offs is very welcome, though needs better visibility. The lack of snacks (cakes, biscuits) to go with a cup of tea or coffee is disappointing."
4174,Alan,2023-01-31,3.5,"Good Convenience to airport. Increased warmth of public areas from previous stays. No rose wine. When I asked for a small red wine I was given a spirit sized measure! When I asked for complimentary water got told there was a tap in my room.. Asked for fried eggs at breakfast, was told ""we don't do fried eggs on Tuesdays"". People skills lacking all round. Also, rooms badly designed with one side of the bed only about one foot from the wall."

4180,Alison,2023-01-28,4.0,"It was great to arrive in a such a welcoming place, both before departure - and on our return. This hotel is the only one at the airport, so it could not fail, but its proximity to it certainly made for a very relaxed departure and arrival. The rooms were not huge, but the beds being very comfortable made up for that and the toiletries provided: shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand wash and body lotion were good quality which made a welcome change as I did not need to unpack may own. The staff were, without exception, all lovely and helpful and pleasant. it would have been good if the bathroom door had been lightproof, so as not to disturb the other guest when needing to get up in the night! It was made with a see-through perspex panel. Also - shutting it made a loud sound and leaving it open to avoid this meant that one was reflected in the mirror opposite the door, whilst doing what you needed to - thus giving one's sharer a great view! We laughed about this, but you may not be aware! Secondly, the entrance area which is filled with tables for guests to drink and eat and meet was looking a bit tired with a few things scratched or peeling and in need of a bit of a refresh, décor-wise to properly meet the star standard."

4213,Mike,2023-01-14,4.0,"Limited options in the area but this is a good option Just a few minutes walk from the terminal building. Clean and spacious lobby and reception area. Food wasn’t the best (quality or value) but what do you expect at an airport hotel, it was perfectly adequate for a night. Room was clean, reasonable size and bed good quality. Food could be a bit better, perhaps need to remember that there will be repeat visitors. I will use this airport regularly but might consider alternative eating arrangements."
4214,Graham,2023-01-14,4.5,Prepared to fly Ideal location for overnight stay before flying. Meals a bit average tasting. Needs better assistance to transport people with heavy cases to airport. Employ a helper with an electric vehicle

4216,Keith,2023-01-13,4.0,Okay but blooming expensive A 5 minute walk from the airport and breakfast from 4am so great for early flights. It was £132 for a nice but ordinary room. It does feel they charge extra for the absence of alternative airport hotels.

4231,Adam,2023-01-08,3.5,"convenient modern rooms, near the airport for early flight staff were very disorganized and four staff said different things when it came to their loyalty scheme and costs etc there was definitely a lack of training even when it came to buying snacks and drinks isn’t the daytime"

4237,Jim,2023-01-05,4.0,Perfect located hotel for late night arrivals or early no departures Proximity to the airport given that I arrived on a late evening flight. Breakfast had some dodgy scrambled eggs rather than fried eggs (you can tell I am struggling to find something bad about the hotel ! )
4238,Debbie,2023-01-05,4.5,Great for night before a flight very good access to airport. friendly staff comfortable and clean
4239,Richard,2023-01-04,4.0,"All good except for the room temperature Location, food, size of room, shower Couldn't get the room warm but was too tired to do anything about it. Went to bed in clothes. The aircon unit was pumping out only cooled air, even when I set it to 25 degrees."
4240,Claire,2023-01-04,4.5,"Handy We've stayed before & it is excellent if you have an early or late flight, although it is a fair walk from the airport. Sounds petty, but the loo seat didn't fit the loo, and the toilet paper was really thin and cheap. Probably used twice the amount of paper, so I think it was a false economy on their part."

4245,Toby,2023-01-02,4.0,"Convenient, comfortable, and worth the price + breakfast Very convenient for airport. Breakfast was varied - continental from 4 am and full English from 6 am. Tied in well with flights and makes sure you start off with a good breakfast! Would be perfect if check-in time was around 1 pm."
4246,Phillie,2023-01-02,4.0,Very good In the heart of the airport. Very comfortable rooms. Nice staff. Good breakfast with many options for lactose and gluten free. Toilet paper is beyond dreadful!

4248,Jason,2023-01-02,4.5,"Superb Everything else, but breakfast. Kind of leaves a bad memory in your mind as you head away from the property. A little disappointed with the choice of breads available and fruit at breakfast. Medium sliced table loaves and frozen summer berry fruit fruit don’t really cut it at this price."
4249,Christina,2023-01-02,4.0,Very good Very close to Airport & Tasty breakfast No bathroom with bathtub & expensive rates
4250,Alison,2023-01-01,4.0,great convenient hotel for airport but will not use again unless a good deal on the price arrives very close proximity to airport especially when able to check in our case the night before. staff very friendly and efficient and food OK. price has increased considerably since it opened. first paid about £70 per night and have stayed 4 times. price increased every time but was £144 this time with parking extra.
4251,L,2023-01-01,4.5,"Comfortsble and very convenient Clean, ideal proximity to the airport as our flight was in the early hours of the morning. I initially drove into the “drop off” area and was worried I’d have to pay £5 at the barrier to get out. Better signage please."
4252,Lee,2023-01-01,4.0,"convenient and pleasantly looked after. clean and tidy , very convenient for airport , staff were nice. not much , bed a bit hard for me and food a beverages a little pricey."
4253,Hannah,2023-01-01,3.5,good stay - decent airport hotel. after service to resolve issue with random payments taken from account not so good - comfy beds. decent breakfast and good service whilst at the hotel the hotel took multiple payments from me of significant amount. whilst Chelsea who I initially dealt with was extremely helpful and tried to help I still have not received all the refund as subsequently staff have not listened to or fully I understood the issue
4254,Tim,2022-12-31,4.0,the only on airport hotel so it’s worth the price excellent location and nice rooms
4255,Anita,2022-12-30,3.5,It’s very convenient for the airport but overpriced. Convenient for the airport. Comfortable and clean rooms. Food isn’t great. No hairdryer or usb ports which I would expect at the high price charged. Badly planned rooms - E.g. no thought given to plugging your hairdryer in and actually being anywhere near a mirror.
4256,Andrew,2022-12-30,3.5,very good except for bed receptionist ( young blonde lady) was particularly helpful to us. she deserves full marks and will go far in life bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. this was the only bad point about our whole one night stay .
4257,Jo,2022-12-29,4.0,"Very convenient and comfy, if you need to stay at the airport. Friendly, helpful staff. Lovely room and bright modern bathroom. Nice that conditioner was supplied. Friends came for a drink and were able to park for a couple of hours for free, which I really appreciated. Before arriving, it was tricky to discover whether there was a restaurant, or just breakfast; also the parking situation. I feel that these things could be promoted better, as both are positive additions to the hotel 😊"
4258,Elizabeth,2022-12-29,4.0,"An excellent option for an early flight from Bristol Airport We booked this hotel as we had a 7am flight and we did not have a car. It is a very short walk along a dedicated path across to the airport. Also, a continental breakfast was available from 4am which was excellent. The room was very spacious and well-equipped and the heating worked well. It is relatively expensive as it is the only hotel at the airport but it was worth it for the peace of mind."
4259,Richard,2022-12-29,4.0,fantastic english breakfast across the road from the airport. the english breakfast was fantastic direction/signage to the hotel can be much better
4260,Dennis,2022-12-28,4.5,Superb Pretty much everything. The room was very good with a comfortable bed. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent. The walk to and from the hotel in the rain
4261,David,2022-12-28,3.5,very convenient location but a few minor issues could be improved. Hotel is the only one on the actual airport site so location is good and you don’t need a courtesy bus. Food in the restaurant was standard stuff but good. Rooms are comfortable and quiet and breakfast albeit continental is on from 4:00 am as many staying are on early flights. Good welcome from reception. The hotel is much lower than the terminal building and even roll along bags require either a climb up several steep flights of steps or a lengthy walk up a series of ramps. There is a short covered section but got soaked walking to the terminal in heavy rain. can’t imagine why a covered way isn’t possible. Restaurant area is getting tired now and for our evening meal (self service)it was difficult to find a clean table.
4262,Linda,2022-12-28,4.0,Very good Very near airport for early flight
4263,Pamela,2022-12-27,4.5,"Bright and clean Beds comfortable, very clean, staff helpful and polite. We had to leave light on in toilet/shower room at night to enable my husband to use toilet safely. The only problem was that the majority of the door is glass and there was also a large mirror opposite, meaning not only was the light in the bathroom shining but also reflected by the large mirror in entrance area, looks very nice and bright, but meaning that the bedroom area was lit up all night, not conducive to a good nights sleep by any other person in party."
4264,John,2022-12-27,4.0,Enjoyed the stay. Not the parking charge Room was great. Parking charge was outrageous Overnight parking charge
4265,Nicola,2022-12-26,4.5,"Superb Clean, comfortable room. Good breakfast. The drinks were rather expensive in the restaurant."
4266,Margaret,2022-12-26,4.0,"Very good Convenient for early flight, good room and shower would use it again probably - depends on cost. One failing was no usb sockets, couldn’t believe this in a newish modern hotel used by a cross section of people flying. Goid that they did provide a plug adaptor but this needs addressing."

4275,Penny,2022-12-22,4.0,Very good Location. Cleanliness. Staff. The fact that you cannot pay with cash at the bar or for your meal at the restaurant.
4276,Steve,2022-12-21,4.0,"Very good  Receptionist was rude, a mistake on the booking name make, the receptionist refused to book the guest in, finally she did but said she wouldn’t do it again."
4277,Prentice,2022-12-20,3.5,"It was good, great location and easy to get to The room was nice and big as a solo traveler it was good No room service but that could be due to coivd still?"
4278,Lesley,2022-12-20,4.5,"already said ‘ideal’. ideal and pleasant. and being told we could have breakfast in the morning between 4am and 6am. booking a family room of 4 including 2 children, 1 age 4 and the other under 1 requiring a cot. the room was exactly the same as my double room. couldn’t walk around once the cot was put in. pram had to go in my room overnight. family rooms need to be larger!!"

4297,Lynne,2022-12-11,3.5,"I chose this hotel because I needed to pick up a rental car the next morning and did not see the point of asking a famil convenient position. After a very late arrival, breakfast finished very early and I was unable to get any."

The price was a little higher than I normally pay, however the location made up for the extra cost"
4323,Anthony,2022-11-26,4.0,Excellent but for the mattress Convenience of location. We were able to drop our airline bags off the night before. The mattress in the room was too firm. I woke with backache. I would have appreciated a mattress topper. Perhaps you could tell me if they provide these. As a frequent traveller from Bristol this would me Imwould definitely stay again on numerous occasions during the year

4331,Charlotte,2022-11-21,4.0,"Almost perfect! Lovely room and hotel overall. Really comfortable, clean and well-equipped. Bathroom was lovely, shower was hot with good pressure. 4am breakfast was high quality and tasty. The smoke/fire alarm in the room (right above the bed) made an audible high-pitched whine all night, which did disrupt my sleep. Luckily I was only there from 11pm to 4am or I would have said something to reception."
4332,Victoria,2022-11-21,3.5,very convenient and comfortable. Staff on check in excellent. staff in morning a little uninterested really convenient for early flight. quiet room and comfy bed food choice very limited and was surprised at how quickly it arrived after ordering (about 3 minutes!!)
4333,Carl,2022-11-20,4.0,Very good Great comfortable hotel in short walking distance from airport… Nice staff… And great buffet breakfast… check in was a bit slow… after flight & airport queues… I was exhausted.
4334,Vikki,2022-11-18,4.0,"perfect for pre/post flight stay location, comfort, clean, good facilities, nice food, excellent sound proofing no cooked vegetarian options at breakfast no bath"
4335,Ryan,2022-11-18,4.0,"Great other than what ive mentioned already, really made my stay sour as it annoyed me quite a lot The stay itself was fine. The fact you have to pay £5 to get out of the car in front of the Hotel or risk a £100 fine is a total joke! The check in staff were agreeing with me on this point and stated that its not under their control, which is fine I accept that! However you as a company/leading brand of hotels should be sticking up for your customers for such things to be removed. Why do you feel its ok for your paying customers to ripped off on your front door? Bristol airport are making a fortune from something completely unfair and people are not given an alternative. money money money that's all its about. Unfair."
4336,Bleddyn,2022-11-18,4.5,Superb Great location. Excellent service. lovely and clean rooms Can't really fault the place. Perfect start to our holiday. No mad rush to the airport or stuck on the motorway.

4338,Paul,2022-11-17,4.0,"Room The staff were great and very helpful and the bed was very comfy, food downstairs was very nice and didn't have to wait long for it to come to you was close to hotel so didn't have to worry about the walk The bathrooms were not very clean there was some unwanted hairs from previous guests that was the only downfall about the hotel the rest of the room was great"
4339,Thomas,2022-11-17,4.0,Very good Location Its a little expensive
4340,Gill,2022-11-17,3.5,Stay was fine.  bedroom was cold not told till the day we checked out we had to request if we wanted heating on.This should be in the information pack. like wise we were dropped off at the hotel and have twice paid a parking fee but this time discovered yo didn’t have to if you took the ticket to reception.
4341,Johanna,2022-11-17,3.5,Friendly efficient hotel. Very comfortable room and bed. Good bathroom and always very clean. Efficient service. Friendly staff. Housekeeping staff particularly good. Breakfast was a little disappointing. I found the food quite oily. The coffee machine is good but the powdered milk completely spoils the taste. Food choice for dinner was limited and until I ordered the curries I found the beef burger and the calamari dishes quite tasteless and the salads were very limited. The tables in the dining area need constant cleaning and the soft furnishings need to be steam cleaned - they are stained and dirty with food. It creates a bad impression altogether.
4342,Kenneth,2022-11-16,4.0,"other than above it was really good good efficient and wonderful staff (well the front desk when we got there) no refrigerator in the room (which was rather important, marketing told us there was one?"

4357,Holly,2022-11-07,4.5,We will be back :-) This was my first stay at the Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport. I slept much better than I have done at any other hotel or B&B on the way to the airport. It does cost a little more but in my opinion is was definitely worth the extra. The menu in the bar/restaurant area was quite basic. It met our needs but was not very exciting and had limited choices.
4358,Jason,2022-11-07,3.5,Good hotel but expensive. Staff very friendly Very expensive

4369,Luisa,2022-11-04,4.5,wales flight so room convenient for overnight stay. 30% too high comfortable room a bit pricey for Bristol airport
4370,Jennifer,2022-11-04,3.5,Good Your telephone message said the price of parking was £8 but we were charged £14.50. Would have liked to park the car for the 4 days but were not offered any options.

Breakfast was excellent for 4am as was the evening meal the night before as above, the room was compact which is ok for overnight but no more"
4373,Richard,2022-11-02,3.5,If you've got a 4am start it's worth it. Proximity to the airport for a very early flight. Able to fill a bag with pastries to take to the terminal Takeaway breakfast options were very limited. Price of a pint at the bar was extortionate.
4374,Simon,2022-11-02,4.0,"Convenient and a good hotel. Stayed over the night before my trip. Convenient hotel and can walk to the airport terminal. Clean, modern and spacious room. Friendly staff.

4378,Giada,2022-11-01,4.0,"Very good Very convenient for early flights. Room was clean & comfortable. Staff was very helpful. Quite expensive. It does make early flights a lot easier, but it's hard to justify the cost on top of flight tickets, so we don't book here very often."

Food available late and breakfast available from 4am. Situated within airport grounds. Short walk with plenty of steep steps, or ramps taking far longer, to walk to airport. No problem if fit and able and not pouring with rain! Arrow taxi rank at airport able to oblige with pickup from hotel and dropoff at airport for under 20 pounds. Worked, but you need to plan in advance especially if heavy rain as I had."

4387,M,2022-10-26,4.5,"Hotel was great but access to Airport was not easy. The Hotel was very good. With two medium sized suitcases, we found the walk to and from the airport difficult and tiring. This was never explained before we booked the hotel and was not expected. We are reasonably fit and not disabled but neither are we Olympic athletes!!!"

4391,Edward,2022-10-24,4.5,Not perfect but pretty good Room too small on one side of bed for 2. Television had no signal. Bathroom sliding door did not fully close. Lack of space on one side of bed for the other person when they got out.

4393,Peter,2022-10-23,3.5,"Good  In a word, the food we ordered for dinner was absolutely hopeless. It was presented well but well, - tasteless and was not beef but something's pretending to be a hamburger. Terrible!"
4394,Veronica,2022-10-22,3.5,too short a stay to make further comments. but comfortable for what we needed perfectly located as we had a very early flight
4395,Matthew,2022-10-21,4.5,"Perfect pre-trip stay I've only ever seen this hotel from the outside and thought it would be the usual souless place you would expect to find at an airport. I couldn't have been more wrong. Great atmosphere, friendly and welcoming employees, decent size room and simply the best bed I've ever slept in (I want one!) Bar prices a little on the steep side."

4397,Lynne,2022-10-19,3.5,Convient The room was comfortable. The food offering was poor in view of the price paid. Not even a proper restaurant. It is about transit passengers but the public areas are poor and not relaxing.

4399,Emma,2022-10-18,3.5,Expensive but comfortable stay in ideal location. location location location. you can’t ask for nearer if you have an early flight and amazingly convenient to do bag drop night before. price. it is expensive for what it is (chain hotel albeit reasonable standard) but fundamentally you are paying for location. Food in cafe (order at counter) is ok but generic.

4401,Paul,2022-10-18,4.0,comfortable hotel which is so close to the airport that it is amazing for early morning flights. close to airport and very clean with friendly helpful staff. comfortable beds and quiet air con that was easily controlled helped get a good nights sleep before a very early flight. very early breakfast (available from 4am!!) was a bonus too. Evening dining facilities were limited in choice but slightly better than airport landslide facilities.

4409,Robert,2022-10-15,3.5,"Expensive, but OK The hotel was a 2 min walk from airport arrivals , which had lights all the way. The room was clean' The night staff were friendly' Don't think it was worth £164 a night. No shower cap or toothpaste in the room, I think at £164 a night, would have been nice."
4410,Nicholas,2022-10-15,3.5,very expensive but close to the terminal location is great for an early flight costs ridiculous amount of money and even short parking for drop off is expensive

4420,Kath,2022-10-11,4.0,"Comfortable stay. Shame about the food  The food was dreadful. Fast food, precooked and then microwaved, not what you expect from the Hilton brand. Continental breakfast was awful. No butter except for a tub of marks and spencer butter, pre-used with toast crumbs in it. No brown bread for toast and no milk. Nobody around to speak to at 4a.m. Receptionists busy with customers checking out"
4421,Ann,2022-10-11,4.5,"Superb Directly on the Airport , bathroom well equipped for our overnight stay, good selection of meals, reasonably priced and the included breakfast adequate .

Liked that there was a breakfast pack to take away as flight was too early for breakfast in the hotel. Was very useful. Price was quite expensive, presumably because of proximity to airport. Not much choice of food at restaurant."
4425,Beatriz,2022-10-10,4.0,Very good Really comfortable bed and lovely room I received a wake up call at 5:30am by mistake as I did not request that. It didn't ruin my stay but I much rather not having received it.

Very close to airport terminal Very quiet room Comfortable bed Reception told us breakfast was from 4am - 11am We arrived for breakfast at 10.10….to be told by quite a grumpy employee breakfast finished at 10am. He reluctantly interrupted a business meeting in the breakfast area and then agreed we could have breakfast. Not great as we’d paid £165 for the night. We didn’t have toast, fruit etc as felt a bit awkward interrupting the morning briefing. The grumpy employee might have offered to help get the extra things we needed for a full breakfast."
4435,Davina,2022-10-07,4.0,Overnight stay chosen for convenience Good food For the price and knowing people turn up at all times often travel weary there could be a bottle of water in the room

Staff were brilliant from my 2:30 am check-in, my everything is included breakfast and to finally check-out. Great help, good breakfast & great service, to be honest best customer service ive received in a hotel for over 2 years and THATS alot of hotels. Well Done to your staff and you are definitely the bonus to a slightly unimpressive Bristol Airport."
4455,Heatley,2022-10-03,4.0,Very good Room clean comfortable excellent location to terminal. Food choice and quality not bad. Staff were friendly Little bit over priced you get caned for last minute booking .

4458,Xabiahelen,2022-10-03,4.0,"Fine, we only needed a room for the night as we have an early flight from the airport. Room was good, quite and clean"
4459,Nicholas,2022-10-03,4.0,Perfectly fine. Convenient location Breakfast was too compicated when in a rush.
4460,Melanie,2022-10-03,4.5,"Really great stay, evening menu lacking choice. The convenience to the airport. The friendly staff, particularly at reception. Incredibly comfortable beds. Lovely temperature in bedroom. Clean and tidy rooms. The poor chouce of food for our evening meal, very basic and special menu stated peas but they were mushy peas....yuk!"
4461,Louise,2022-10-03,3.5,"Did the job though not a enjoyable and relaxing start to holiday, thought it was expensive. Convenient and geared up for flights, efficient and friendly check in. quiet, good beds, good sleep. Breakfast from 4 am ! Super close walk to terminal, though wouldn’t be ok if you had mobility problems as included 2 flights of steps. Good that taxis get a free pass out otherwise they won’t accept pick up . We were sorely disappointed by the poor quality, limited choice and poor value of evening meal . The ‘Special’ was a dried up cheap pie, brown smash and a few mushy peas - only the gravy made it edible. I thought even the staff were embarrassed. The dining room area was grubby and tired (seats stained and bits of coleslaw / food o do had to watch where you sat).Badly arranged canteen style with little ambiance or coziness and was a continuation of reception and the thoroughfare to the airport. Breakfast was really good but chaotic, only one coffee machine switched on , run out of teabags, food stations and crockery/ cutlery not topped up - so took ages to find things you wanted . Room was good except for trim missing on bathroom door and grubby and shredded shower tray non slip section . Not what I expected from a good brand and premium price."

4466,The,2022-10-02,3.5,"Good Great buffet breakfast, friendly staff, and only a very short walk from airport entrance. We arrived near midnight with our little kid and they had forgotten to make up the sofa bed so we had to wait for them to come with bedding which was not great with a very tired and crying child."

4471,Casey,2022-10-01,4.0,"Convenient and friendly We stayed here due to having a flight from the airport the next day - it was very practical. But the staff were friendly, the room was decent, and the breakfast had a good variety of options. Bed wasn't the comfiest ... but then I struggle with pillows etc that I find comfortable."

4478,Hans,2022-09-27,4.0,my very short stay fulfilled the purpose... excellent - nothing I didn´t like nothing
4479,Alexander,2022-09-26,3.5,"THE LOCATION WAS BRILLIANT BUT AT A HIGH PRICE. WE CHOSE THE HOTEL PURELY FOR THE LOCATION AND THAT IT WAS A GOOD HOTEL CHAIN. THE STAFF WERE EXTREMELY FRIENDLY AND PROFESSIONAL. FOR ONE NIGHT'S STAY £240 FOR ONE NIGHT WAS A LOT OF MONEY AND OVERALL DID NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THAT COST. THE ROOM FACILITIES WERE GOOD BUT HAD A BASIC LOOK/FEEL..........CONSIDERING THE COST OF THE ROOM. WE HAD A MEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MINE BACK AS IT HAD NOT BEEN MICROWAVED THOROUGHLY. THE CENTRE WAS COLD AND THE REST TEPID. THE STAFF WERE QUICK TO SORT THIS OUT AND THE REPLACEMENT MEAL WAS PIPING HOT. HOWEVER, THE MEAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN PIPING HOT TO BEGIN WITH! ONCE AGAIN, FOOD AND DRINK HIGHLY PRICED BUT NOT AT A STANDARD THAT GOES WITH £240 PER NIGHT."

4485,Margaret,2022-09-25,3.5,Good Proximity to airport Food very average compared to Birmingham airport hotel
4486,Finola,2022-09-24,4.0,"Convenient for airport (250 yard walk), clean and comfortable, but all of the above. Very close to airport and room clean and comfortable. Check in staff cheerful and friendly. Menu could be improved, along with the service at the bar (One person who blamed staff shortages - not my problem) We booked a room with breakfast, but had a very early departure so we were given a breakfast bag - a banana, a chocolate cereal bar and something else which I threw away - very poor, not even a hot drink. All in all, OK for convenience but very expensive (£157) for what we actually got."
4487,Ruth,2022-09-24,4.5,Excellant and a perfect start to out UK trip Hot Breakfast was very good and with a wide variety of items We are very pleased with Bristol and the close location of the Hotel. The room more than met our expectations I found it difficult to find the right sized plated and surprised there was no Hot plates for the Hot breakfast. I would have liked some Grenola or equivalent for breakfast

4496,Sally,2022-09-20,3.5,Good It's a comfortable and safe hotel for solo travellers. The price! The room was much more expensive than in February. The croissants at breakfast could have been fresher.
4497,Jackie,2022-09-20,4.5,Lovely stay although quite expensive for time we were there. We were very early leaving and able to take a bagged breakfast! Excellent! Somewhere for children to sit and play quietly . There lots of games and drawing available but children had to sit at tables next to adult strangers. We were two families with 4 extremely well behaved children - It would have been nice to have a small area separate though!

Ideal to walk to the airport. 3 people in room meant the 3rd person was on a sofa bed so limited space to move and the sofa bed was not very comfortable.

Only needed a couple of Rooms for short time due to early morning flight and hotel suited this purpose excellently. Short walk to Airport Terminal. Staff very attentive and friendly. Continental Breakfast available for early starters. We had an issue with checking in. I had booked two rooms and they had difficulty with finding one of the rooms details. However this was sorted quite quickly. Little on the expensive side for the time we were there.
4519,Madeleine,2022-09-15,4.0,"Good, but too expensive! Room was excellent - everything great. Location great - short walk to Terminal - ideal place to stay for an early morning flight.

4527,Lorna,2022-09-13,4.0,Very enjoyable and comfortable The room was very comfortable as was the bed. All Linen and towels were clean. We were surprised also how quiet the hotel was considering its proximity to the airport. The ease of booking in to the airport for our flight Just a small complaint about the breakfast. The sausages were overcooked and the skins were very tough to cut through. Also the scrambled eggs were dry. Otherwise everything else was okay.
4528,Alison,2022-09-13,3.5,"It was easy to book, expensive for one night but comfortable stay close to the airport very expensive. not many staff on when checking in so took a while (30mins wait) we didn’t eat as the reviews were not very good."
4529,Linda,2022-09-13,3.5,"It was comfortable but t would have liked a warm, comfortable and friendly bar or coffee area It was very close to the airport. It was too expensive and the decor and facilities did not warrant the high prices. I would have expected a much higher standard for that price range."
4530,Karen,2022-09-12,4.0,"Great location, nice clean room. Wish we had known about the food available Room. Tea and coffee in room. Shower. We were advised that there was no restaurant .

I was not able to have breakfast at the hotel as my flight was too early for the breakfast service but a take away breakfast bag was supplied instead. My hotel room was very quiet and I did not have any disturbance from the airport. I cannot think of anything that could be better."
4536,Beverley,2022-09-12,4.5,Superb LOVELY STAFF Bed was super comfy and hotel really clean Not enough choice for vegetarian food. I arrived late and all that was available was cheese sandwich. The soya milk seemed to be a problem for the staff but they got round it. At the morning buffet the potato cakes were hard and dried out. The vegetarian sausages were of very poor quality and tasted horrible. I think you need to increase awareness of available vegan and vegetarian options for cooked breakfast.

Expensive howe Location, facilities and staff Booking.com advertised a property credit of £20 included in the £185 rate and as we intended to dine, thought this was worth the extra. The hotel staff were unaware of this offer/arrangement which was awkward and embarrassing, although they were charming enough to honour it. Please sort this out between the hotel and Booking.com as it should not be advertised unless agreed and known by staff."

4593,Sotiria,2022-08-23,3.5,"Good Excellent location, 5 min on foot from the airport. Ideal for an overnight stay. The room was a good size and the bathroom was spacious. I explicitly requested a packed breakfast as we had an early flight. Even though I was promised that would be the case, there was no packed breakfast available at 06:00 and we had to quickly grub a couple of items from the breakfast buffet on our way to the airport."
4594,Rhianydd,2022-08-22,4.0,From the airport to bed in under 10 minutes! The location is perfect for the airport Breakfast is good with plenty of choice and extended times. Staff are friendly The food on offer in the evening is basic. We'd eat before arrival next time. No room service Rooms are basic but fine for the purpose of our stay

4603,Margaret,2022-08-18,3.5,"Comfortable, nice hotel, very convenient. Location was excellent for an early flight At 1.30am in the morning the emergency alarm was going. This was apparently a ""false"" alarm. Everyone had started to evacuate when we were told this. There was no apology or explanation. This meant disrupted sleep particularly for families in nearby rooms."

4607,Valerie,2022-08-15,4.0,Good airport hotel though quite expensive  some of the staff did not seem very well informed e.g. one told me that I could not order at the bar and charge to the room.
4608,Rebecca,2022-08-14,3.5,"Good for ease of access to the airport for an early morning flight. Location, ease of access to the airport, clean and modern hotel The queen sofa beds aren’t comfortable. The food in the restaurant at dinner time was poor. The digital key on the app didn’t initially work and I was told to go to the checkin despite checking in in advance which defies the point of the early checkin."
4609,John,2022-08-14,3.5,"ok, but if it wasn’t for the location the hotel wouldn’t have an awful lot going for it. but if you want the airport the location No room service"

Take away breakfast available if leaving early. Clean, spacious family room with big sofa bed and a queen bed. Staying one night to drop son off at airport early in the morning. Had to pay 15 pounds car park fee for the night. Thought it could have been complimentary as staying in hotel."

4615,Lauren,2022-08-10,4.5,"Exceeded expectations I wasn't expecting much from this hotel when booking. Booked for convenience as it was closest to the airport, however it exceeded my expectations. Loved the rooms, the decor and ambiance. Staff were friendly and helpful. All facilities were up to a good standard. Good choice especially for breakfast! We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend. The toilets in reception were not clean and there were crumbs and dirt in reception waiting area that let the rest of it down."
4616,Erica,2022-08-09,4.5,Superb convenient to airport fir late arrival and fir pick up of hire vehicle. my room was at the end of a corridor so very quiet.
4617,Leony,2022-08-09,4.0,Convenient but a little expensive especially when having y to o pay h fi or parking on top  Having to pay to park at the hotel! I know we had an early flight so left at 3am but I think they could offer more than they do for breakfast at that time for the price or give the option of not paying for breakfast.

4625,Lucie,2022-08-08,4.5,Comfortable and good location for the airport Comfy beds and good selection at breakfast Food at dinner could be improved - wasn’t quite the standard expected for the price paid
4626,David,2022-08-07,4.0,"It's a budget hotel in a unique location. The hotel prices itself accordingly. Location Hot breakfast doesn't start until 7:00 People stay here to meet early flights, hot food earlier would have been appreciated"

4628,Alison,2022-08-06,4.5,"Superb Great staff. So handy for the airport. Great aircon (I was there in the heatwave). It was a bit pricey, but airport hotels often are."
4629,Barry,2022-08-06,3.5,"Disappointing compared to previous stays We have stayed here quite a few times when having an early flight or late arrival. In terms of proximity to the airport and pure convenience, it just can't be beaten. Compared to previous stays, this was disappointing. The hotel remains unchanged in terms of cleanliness, professional staff and convenience etc., but the price we paid was considerably higher than before - I would say double the price, if not more. My past reviews were, of course based on a lower price, and therefore better value. The food served also seemed to be of lower quality - same menu, similar price, but just not as good. We have decided, despite the obvious convenience, not to repeat our stay at current pricing levels."
4630,Kate,2022-08-05,4.0,"Very good Short walk from the airport, lovely staff, v comfy bed and good breakfast. There's also a huge space for hanging out before you need to go to the airport, with departure boards. Much more comfortable than the airport itself."
4631,Emmanuel,2022-08-05,3.5,"All perfect...but the ""restaurant""!! Super fast check in, I was done in 2mn. The room was perfect, spacious, clean, comfortable bed, everything there. Short walk to the terminal. Staff very professional. The restaurant is not really a restaurant. I order indian food, it arrived within 5mn, tasted rather like a cheap ready meal (I really believe it was a ready meal, it was definitely NOT proper food cooked from scratch), awful. And you can only pay by card, they do not accept cash. I wish I got a Subway from the terminal instead."

We weren’t offered a choice for it not to be included."

4644,Karen,2022-07-31,4.5,Superb Standards of cleanliness are top notch. Food quality of evening meal was not tasty(fish and chips) chips were lukewarm.
4645,Charles,2022-07-30,4.0,"As an airport hotel it was a good choice being close to the terminal and met our requirements. We picked this airport hotel due to a leg injury I sustained whilst on holiday. I booked Special Assistance with the airline and the hotel staff were very helpful in arranging for the transfer bus to the terminal. Room was well furnished. Bathroom with large walk-in shower was a plus. The twin-room could have been a little larger as it was very difficult to use the chair at the work desk - too tight to the bed. Basic English breakfast, adequate but nothing exceptional."

People working there are helpful and kind. Restaurant is also very efficient and good quality. So a short stay become a good relaxing moment Price is slightly higher than expected, even evaluating position and great service."

The room was perfect for my mother and I. It did not mention that there was a kettle in the room which was an added bonus. My Aunt and Uncle drove us to the hotel which was quite a distance for them. It was so nice that we were able to offer them tea in the restaurant and not have to pay a parking fee as the car parking ticket was validated by the reception staff. I was also able to push the wheeelchair for my Mother from the room to the airport check in without too much effort."

4699,Rebecca,2022-07-06,3.5,"Nice hotel, dinner in restaurant poor Lovely fresh rooms, nice and big, easy to control temperature, black out curtains excellent. Breakfast setup great for early flights Quick walk to airport Food was terrible. Ordered a jacket potato with beans for my daughter, the beans were stone cold with some scrambled egg in them??? Couldn't help but think they were left over from breakfast. Gross. I ordered a burger and chips and neither were even warm! We sent both meals back (after having to flag restaurant staff down they were no where to been seen during the meal) but both came back barely warm again. Couldn't be bothered with the faff of having to find someone again as we were starving from travelling. No one came to check or say sorry it was really poor for the price of the food and the price of the rooms!"
4700,Nicholas,2022-07-06,4.0,"Very good Get staff, location, breakfast, cleanliness etc. We wanted family room (2 adult 2 kids) but all that was available was double with sofa bed pullout.

4701,Cherry,2022-07-05,4.5,Superb Such a convenient location to the airport- great. Check in was speedy and the receptionist was helpful and informative. Beds were comfortable and we slept well Surprised that breakfast ended so abruptly and also so soon after fresh hot food had been put out

Food and drink was reasonably priced given the location Was not made aware at check in that a breakfast bag was available for early departures.

4724,Gerard,2022-06-27,4.0,very close to the airport stay ideal for airport early/late flights; nice downstairs lounge/restaurant
4725,Janet,2022-06-26,3.5,"All the staff were cheerful and extremely helpfully I had ordered special assistance with Ryanair and the hotel told me that there was no problem with this. However at 4am they were not able to contact Ryanair - no one was answering the phone.After more than half an hour of trying, one of the receptionists said that she would go up to the airport with me and carry my luggage. I was very grateful and thought that this was above and beyond the call of duty. I would have liked waitress service in the restaurant. As I have a back problem I found standing in a queue waiting to order very difficult."
4726,Wendy,2022-06-26,4.5,"great for an early flight but expensive Clean, friendly staff, location great for airport it was expensive"

4742,Natalia,2022-06-20,4.5,Superb was very short walking distance to the airport. Was quiet so could have a good night rest before the early morning flight.
4743,Kate,2022-06-20,4.0,"We enjoyed our stay and being able to check our luggage in with Jet2 the night before made things so much less stressful proximity to the airport. Takeaway breakfast was very poor. Two cartons of juice, an apple and a packet of biscuits!"
4744,Daniel,2022-06-19,4.0,Very good  Room service
4745,Elizabeth,2022-06-19,4.0,"Very good welcoming poor external signage from the Airport. Poor lighting to the hotel once one had left the immediate Airport area, as a woman I would have been very wary if I had been on my own. Some breakfast foods not available."
4746,Colin,2022-06-18,4.5,Superb Conveniently located on the airport. Room comfortable.
4747,Fee,2022-06-17,4.0,"Stay was very comfortable. The location was excellent and so surprised we couldn’t hear any noise from airplanes. Excellent breakfast. Your front of house male on the checking in desk was very pleasant and helpful. We did go to get some drinks and a female serving was a little bit brusk and not extremely helpful, plus I couldn’t get a coffee as she said the machine was broken. She seemed a little bit impatient."
4748,Isabelle,2022-06-16,4.0,Very good Walking distance to airport Breakfast was not cooked properly
4749,Laraine,2022-06-15,3.5,great for airport travel. at the airport so great for tired travelers. breakfast was very basic.

4752,Angie,2022-06-14,4.5,"Great for an early morning flight Right next door to the airport, had an early morning flight so missed breakfast but they did a take away breakfast of a croissant, juice and an orange. Friendly staff, restaurant food is quick and easy ie pizza, burgers, pasta dishes"
4753,Kelly,2022-06-14,4.5,"Ideal location Great location Only a takeaway breakfast bag as I had an early flight, but the booking is bed and breakfast"
4754,Linda,2022-06-14,4.5,"we would definitely stay there again. Ideal location convenient location, clean, bedrooms quiet. queues for drinks and food. insufficient staff"

4756,Sharon,2022-06-13,4.5,"Superb Location, comfortable and clean. Good breakfast Everything was ok"
4757,Goddard,2022-06-13,4.0,Will use again The location in relation to the departures at the airport
4758,Leigh-anne,2022-06-13,3.5,overpriced but convenient stop over for early morning flights. proximity to airport is main reason to use this hotel as the room price has become very expensive. Staff are pleasant. Nothing much not to like except perhaps there was a lack of anything easy to grab like a banana at 4am for an early morning flight and no bags obvious to take a pastry in. I didn't have time to search for a staff member to ask. I would only use this hotel when flight departure is 8 am or earlier as it has become quite expensive. There are many other options within a 10 minute drive some offering airport transfers.
4759,Alyson,2022-06-12,3.5,"Very convenient for flights and a good quality room The room was very well appointed, attractive and spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable and the room was well sound-proofed. staff at reception and in the bar/restaurant were all very friendly and helpful. The restaurant meal wasn’t great quality and the advertised ’grab and go’ breakfast for early starters turned out to mean ‘make your own breakfast and put it in one of these bags - except that we’ve run out of bags.’ We ended up just grabbing a croissant, which turned out to be stale."
4760,Edwina,2022-06-12,4.0,It’s was ok and convenient  Juice provided that had to be thrown away at check in
4761,Tim,2022-06-12,4.5,Very good stay after a flight Location is just outside arrivals/departures.Food available at all times and the breakfast is particularly good.Very clean and comfortable place to stay Nothing to dislike
4762,Christopher,2022-06-12,4.5,"very pleasant stay before flying rooms were spacious, very clean. the rooms a were very quite . walking distance to the airport.ordered evening food which was very good . that the high price did not include a takeaway breakfast which was in with the prices. we had a early start. that we had to pay parking at this hotel which was next door to the hotel."
4763,Verenna,2022-06-11,3.5,"Ok, convenient but expensive clean, nice shower, lovely staff. Not a great mattress and duvet too small for a queen size bed! why do hotels use too small duvets? curtains could do with a hoover! very dusty. Food was adequate but not great."
4764,Keith,2022-06-11,4.0,Excellent location and a very well maintained hotel with polite and friendly staff Great location for airport. There were several items on the menu not available.
4765,Joy,2022-06-10,3.5,ok location reception staff so very slow at check in - late at night and just took ages with the computer and paperwork.
4766,Lynda,2022-06-09,3.5,Convenient location but what happened to my pajamas?? Convenient I left my pajamas in the room and only noticed when I got to the holiday destination but thought no worries picking up thecar in a week's time I will call in to Reception which I did. Told them I had been in Room 10 a week ago but staff said no pajamas. Either the cleaner took them or simply threw them away. I emailed the General Manager and have heard nothing. Considering we paid £186 for the room and we had to leave at 2am in the morning and we were told there would be breakfast bags to Takeaway which there wasn't I think it is not good value. Surely a hotel of this size must have some sort of Lost Property system in place.
4767,Mrs,2022-06-08,4.0,"Very good  The take away breakfast was poor in comparison if had a full breakfast for the same price. Banana, breakfast bar, OJ and pain au chocolate did not warrant a B&B price"
4768,Tracy,2022-06-08,4.0,Overnight stay The staff were brilliant in the restaurant and bar area. The menu and food were very basic. The communal areas were quite dirty
4769,Patricia,2022-06-08,4.5,Just want we needed and so clean and very helpful staff on reception  Disappointing menu but everything else very good. Would stay again
4770,Kevin,2022-06-08,3.5,Good Located Fire door outside room banged due to door dampers not working
4771,Terry,2022-06-07,4.5,Great location within the airport - value for money. Very friendly and efficient booking in on the day. Room was very comfortable and spotless. Breakfast was excellent and plentiful. 👍 -
4772,Alex,2022-06-07,3.5,Good Amazing provision of takeaway breakfast for early morning flyers. Could be more sound proofed.
4773,Zak,2022-06-07,3.5,"absolutely perfect for a nights rest before and after any holiday trip very close to the airport, so incredibly convenient! the food is pricey whilst being nothing more special than wetherspoons food. We weren’t personally fans of the pillows"
4774,Neil,2022-06-07,3.5,I would use it again Location excellent for an early morning flight Not easy to get into hotel from multi storey story carpark at night
4775,Alec,2022-06-07,4.5,"A good place to get your head down after a long uncomfortable night flight Convenient location after a night flight, so we were both tired and just wanted a comfy bed for a few hours. It was all fine"
4776,Judith,2022-06-07,3.5,"Good close to airport, very friendly stuff, clean The restaurant could be a touch better, but I have to say we stayed just after travels started to pick up"

4778,Cindy,2022-06-06,4.5,"I liked the facilities, food and comfortable room, but as I normally travel alone it was expensive for single occupancy very convenient for the airport. food very good. expensive if you were travelling alone. no single rooms."
4779,Katrina,2022-06-06,4.0,"very convenient for airport if pricey location, check in, comfy bed price was rather high at over £200"

4781,Sue,2022-06-05,4.0,"Very good Breakfast selection was Ok, the hot dishes could have been hotter, Our room was was of the ground floor, I did not like we had people walk past our window . I found this to be very disconcerting."
4782,Scott,2022-06-05,4.0,Very good Location and service v good. We didn't have time for breakfast as our flight was so early.
4783,Gazk,2022-06-05,4.0,"Comfortable hotel very close to airport. Arrived very late after a delayed flight - 2.45am But at least we got some sleep before heading home the next day. Room was comfortable, but we didn't have breakfast - needed to get as much sleep as possible. A later check out would have been appreciated."
4784,Joanne,2022-06-05,4.0,"Perfect location for airport We had an early flight so it was perfect location being a 5 minute walk from the airport. Nice toiletries. Tea and coffee is room which is always a plus! The room was spacious and clean. Unfortunately we did not have time for breakfast, which was included as we had to check in. I would imagine lots of people miss out on breakfast due to early flights but I don’t remember seeing any options excluding breakfast (i could be wrong). Staff not overly friendly, just ok."
4785,Grocott,2022-06-04,3.5,"Good Room.was clean., good shower and comfortable bed Not much of a choice at breakfast at 5am. Overpriced , but convenient for the airport"
4786,Eve,2022-06-04,4.0,"quiet and very comfortable room was just what I needed after a flight delay clean and quiet room none, it was as expected"
4787,Mary,2022-06-04,3.5,ok but have had better there easy access to airport too many crowds and not enough staff to handle
4788,Tracey,2022-06-04,4.5,Superb short walk to the airport.
4789,Beverley,2022-06-04,4.0,"It does what it says on the tin! Room was good, shower excellent. Therr weren’t enough staff to cope with the influx of very close to the airport"
4790,Ian,2022-06-03,3.5,excellent faculties but very limited on catering. much queuing and poor coffee quality proximity cleanliness friendliness catering was mediocre
4791,Penelope,2022-06-03,4.5,"Better than I remembered Hotel was very busy and airport in chaos, but the staff had it all in hand and were managing smoothly with a smile on their faces. Very generous check out policy when our flight was delayed Food is a bit Meh, though breakfast from 4am was appreciated"

4793,Louise,2022-06-02,4.0,"Ideal location beside airport but very expensive. Perfect location, good room. Restaurant food below par for this standard of hotel. Overpriced."

4801,Lucie,2022-05-30,4.0,"comfortable but dining experience could be better very convenient - 2mins walk to airport Food was expensive for what was provided (quality / taste / portion size), if better quality price would be reasonable."
4802,Malcolm,2022-05-30,4.0,Very good proximity to airport
4803,Sarah,2022-05-30,4.5,Superb literally next to the airport so perfect for catching an early flight. Breakfast available from 4am! comfortable bed nothing really
4804,Jo,2022-05-29,3.5,early morning flight makes a pre flight hotel essential. located on the main Bristol Airport site. a short walk from the terminal. as the airport struggles to administer flights a pre flight hotel is essential. early morning flights are severely impacted. travel to the airport the night before and maximise your sleep. the staff at the hotel are warm and welcoming it's a shame that that the hotel fails to deliver the basics: bed - wobbles around shower - cold
4805,Cindy,2022-05-28,4.0,"when your late flight is delayed by 2.5 hours and you arrive at 2.30 am, it was so lovely to be welcomed by a very frien perfect for staying after returning from holiday on a late flight nothing"

4807,Gregg,2022-05-27,3.5,End of holiday stay Extremely convenient location only 2 minutes from the terminal. Expensive. I would definitely consider somewhere a lot cheaper and pay for a taxi.

4811,Steven,2022-05-27,3.5,"Airport hotel Ability to get up and go to the airport at 4am without the need for transfers. Pre packed breakfast bags for our collection on reception. Very quiet room which had all the facilities and was spotless. Long queue for the bar so we did not bother to have our nightcap, not enough staff (or under-trained) which caused this problem and delayed check in as well. No adequate signage from the multi storey car park which meant a long walk in the rain to find the hotel entrance."
4812,Rachael,2022-05-26,3.5,"location great , early start breakfast no real option and no staff to help with breakfadt bags location no breakfast choice at 3am ( as its an airport hotel i am sure most visitors have an early start at the airport thats why they are staying)"
4813,Philip,2022-05-25,4.0,Very good as always Good service as usual. right hotel in the right place. dinner menu quick service but poor choices
4814,David,2022-05-25,3.5,Expensive way to reduce stress of early start. Provided packed breakfast for early start. Price.
4815,Kate,2022-05-25,3.5,Bedroom was clean and well appointed. The bar / restaurant area is soulless and the staff were disorganised. At leas Fantastic location to Bristol Airport. The bar / restaurant service was really poor with long queues in order to be served.
4816,Elaine,2022-05-25,4.5,Just what was needed pre and post holiday Fantastic bed-huge! Great shower Quiet Great breakfast choice On site Food was reasonably priced and good Had 2 visits either side of holiday and air con on first stay far too cold-think engineers were working on it
4817,Jackie,2022-05-24,4.5,Superb We were still greeted by friendly staff after delayed flight at 2.00 am
4818,Dika,2022-05-24,4.5,"Superb breakfast very good, lots of choice"
4819,Michelle,2022-05-24,4.0,"Convenient for airport, breakfast good, bar evening meal poor standard. Up to early for breakfast this stay, but have had breakfast at hotel previously and breakfast is good, did order an evening meal and it was definitely below standard very disappointed. Evening meal very poor, not a fresh cooked meal at all."
4820,Karen,2022-05-23,4.5,"Absolutely fabulous! Great location exceptionally clean quiet rooms. Very comfortable bed! dreamy shower. Good value food. Crazy queues for check in this could be improved. I initially felt put off as it was the first opinion of hotel, however everything improved from this point onwards."
4821,Mark,2022-05-23,3.5,"Good, not great Location for airport could not be better. Brand new hotel, everything clean and tidy Slow check in, cott not in room when requested and when delivered dumped in room hallway without being able to get it past the bed and into the room. Breakfast bags provided for those departing before 4am, but no pre-orders taken for these. None left when we got to the lobby so we had to go without."
4822,William,2022-05-23,4.0,Good to have hotel provide dinner and breakfasts so near to the terminal. check in and check out breakfast set up able to walk to terminal Short staffed at dining. Only one person. sometimes 2 who took orders and then had to fill the drinks before being able to attend to next person in line. Waiting in line took long.....15 + minutes to be. More staff at dinner time to handle the number of customers. dinner was brought to table efficiently and was a good curry dinner.
4823,Heather,2022-05-23,4.5,Comfortable stay Clean and comfortable and very close to the airport which is helpful when catching an early flight. Nothing
4824,Becky,2022-05-23,3.5,Good Lovely room with easy and quick access to the airport. Bar was understaffed meaning there was a long queue for food and drinks. Evening meal wasnt the best quality but the buffet breakfast was outstanding. Think it is a little bit overpriced but we would stay again.
4825,Jill,2022-05-22,4.0,"Convenient for the airport, great breakfast Close to airport for late arrivals. Great breakfast. Nothing"
4826,Nigel,2022-05-22,3.5,Satisfactory. Good location for the airport. Breakfast (although early 6.30am had no eggs!). Otherwise all ok.

4828,Chris,2022-05-22,4.5,Superb Location Comfortable rooms Good choice on breakfast Not a good choice for evening menu. Needed more variety
4829,Linda,2022-05-22,3.5,Good Good choice of breakfast When we were booked in the rate on the sign in sheet was completely wrong and if I hadny noticed it I would have been charged £80 more than I was expecting Not a good start
4830,Richard,2022-05-22,4.0,Fine ! Pleasant & helpful staff. Proximity to airport Only 2 tissues left in box !
4831,Tina,2022-05-21,4.5,Pretty good but the early breakfast should be out earlier Not much Fruit still frozen in middle and yogurt poor taste
4832,Yvonne,2022-05-21,4.5,It was fine for our purpose but the food needs stepping up. Happy with the room and service. The food is appalling and we’re not fussy eaters. It was just the same the last time we stayed.
4833,Clare,2022-05-21,3.5,"Good Excellent location. Good size room and friendly staff. I would happily stay there again. There was an issue at check in, all the computers were down which caused a delay. This was not the fault of the staff, who were trying their best to deal with the situation in a polite and friendly manner, however after a long day of travelling and arriving quite late, it added to my tiredness!"
4834,Kate,2022-05-21,4.0,"Great location for airport Excellent location. Nice staff. Lovely breakfast options. Perfect for the airport, literally 5 mins walk"
4835,M,2022-05-20,4.0,Very good Staff were very welcoming and helpful on arrival and departure. The room was perfectly adequate for our needs and was very quiet - which was unexpected and very welcome. The breakfast was fine with a varied choice. I was impressed with the electronic noticeboard in the breakfast/lounge area that listed flight arrivals and departures - it appeared to be the same as the one used in the airport. The pillows. I prefer a slim to medium thickness pillow. The 2 pillows provided were much thicker than I'd prefer.
4836,Kitti,2022-05-19,4.5,"Superb The self-service breakfast was excellent. So many choices, and using a tray made everything easier. Just like in the good old days at school. I hope the management appreciates the staff."
4837,Sharon,2022-05-19,3.5,"functional, let’s face it who chooses to stay in an airport hotel?! the staff were young and lovely even when clearly pushed by so many visitors house keeping need to hoover under the beds! I also would have loved a non caffeine late night drink - herb teas?"
4838,David,2022-05-19,4.5,Superb convenient location for early departure or a late arrival … staff very friendly
4839,William,2022-05-19,4.5,Great for overnight stay before early flight. Really handy for overnight before we flew and we could check our luggage in the night before. Made the whole security check much easier as did the paid for fast track. Very busy bar service for both drinks and food as the hotel doesn't have a restaurant as such. The staff were doing their very best but they had a lot of people to serve.
4840,Rosalind,2022-05-19,4.0,convenient location price
4841,Lewis,2022-05-19,4.0,Very good It was in a good location to get to the airport for an early flight. The food menu seemed limited and they didn’t accept cash. It was my understanding that cash was still legal tender 🤷‍♂️
4842,Scott,2022-05-18,4.0,splendid stay here before my flight room very smart and clean shower was cheap
4843,Julie,2022-05-18,3.5,"Very convenient location. Very close to airport terminal. Basic , reasonably comfortable room. Convenient! Pillows were terrible.. flat and hard. Nobody answered at reception on repeat calls to change them/ get more."
4844,David,2022-05-18,4.0,Very convenient and practical Position
4845,Laurence,2022-05-17,4.0,"Generally good room but breakfast disappointing. Excellent location. Breakfast was quite disappointing, no staff, no fried eggs, fruit salad was clearly from a low range catering tin. Layout not intuitive at all. The shower in the room did not drain fast enough to prevent overflow."
4846,Mark,2022-05-17,4.0,"Nice and convenient for the airport, slightly overpriced though.... Hotel nice and quiet and really handy if you have an early morning flight and need are travelling to the airport the day before. Check in took absolutely ages as the payment systems were down. Eventually got booked into my room and the payment was taken during the early hours of the next morning. Once I got to my destination country I had a notification off my card provider to say the hotel had taken the same payment again. So did the person I was travelling with. Could not get hold of them by phone so upon arrival back to Bristol Airport had to physically go in the hotel wait for ages in the que and then take the issue up with the person on the check in desk. It was resolved but was hassle I could have done without."
4847,Barbara,2022-05-17,4.5,"excellent , staff were so helpfull location nothing"

4851,Susan,2022-05-16,3.5,"Stay would I have been marked better if evening food menu better Room clean. Early serving of breakfast. Location Evening meal menu disappointing, service station, fast food the only option"
4852,Robert,2022-05-16,4.0,Over all satisfactory The location was central to my travel and it worked out well The Parking. Unfortunately having to pay for parking is a massive dissapointment. In Ireland the one good thing is people staying in the hotel have free parking. This was also not advertised that you had to pay the parking and if it was not for the staff explaining how to do the parking I would have ended up with a large unexpected bill. The bar was cashless. The other issue was the bar/restaurant was cashless. If you did not have a credit card then you could not purchase any food or drink.
4853,Zena,2022-05-15,4.0,Very good  Price doubled since my stay in Jan 2022
4854,Colin,2022-05-15,4.0,It was good apart from the pillows Good The pillows are awful

4856,Christopher,2022-05-15,3.5,Good proximity to airport very pricey for no frills accommodation
4857,Lisa,2022-05-15,4.0,"Very good The location for a very early flight the following day.The room was very clean and comfortable When we stayed before, we were able to have a continental breakfast, but the time that starts appear to have changed, so unable to have it as our check in was at 0400 which was a shame"
4858,Martino,2022-05-15,4.5,"Superb Very nice room, spacious and clean. Few steps from the airport, it's ideal to catch early morning flights"
4859,Angela,2022-05-14,4.0,we were only there a few hours as we had to be at the airport for 3am so no time for breakfast it is so close to the airport the price

4863,Kathleen,2022-05-12,4.0,Convenient stopover but at a price. Within walking distance of Bristol airport. Modern hotel. Nice food. Our pre booked cot for baby wasn’t in room. Only towels for one person in twin room. Pricey.

4865,Wendy,2022-05-12,4.5,"Perfect short stay before early flight. So convenient for a very early flight at the airport. Room and shower room modern, well equipped and comfortable. Good evening meal and could even take some breakfast with us. A bath would have been nice as well as a shower."
4866,Samantha,2022-05-12,4.0,"would definitely stay again friendly staff, convenient location. slippery shower tray. drinks on the bar were expensive. bed a little too hard."
4867,Mario,2022-05-12,3.5,Good  The way that the food section operated. We had ordered some fish and chips. Fish was not cooked properly. Waited ages and then we were told it could be cooked again I said we will get a sandwich from Airport no offer of a refund!! Totally unprofessional . The room excellent very clean even showerhead . Check in professional and friendly . The above was a big let down
4868,Geoffrey,2022-05-12,3.5,"Very good location for airport very quiet slept well. Didn't have breakfast was an early morning flight We asked for an early morning call which we didn't get, we asked at reception and they said the phone in our room didn't work. Not very good!!"

4870,Robert,2022-05-11,4.0,"Very good Lovely atmosphere, comfortable room, friendly staff. Breakfast included in room price but not available for us as we had a 6am flight as our flight was at 6am and we had to leave the hotel before breakfast. Therefore paid for something that wasn't available. No option when booking room to not pay for breakfast."
4871,Jennifer,2022-05-11,4.5,"Superb Lovely room, easy walking distance to the terminal The food was good - we both had a curry. We will stay there again."
4872,Phillip,2022-05-11,4.0,"clean, tidy, comfortable hotel that does what it says! clean and functional. friendly welcome by the check in staff having to cue up to order evening meal and drinks. not the greatest way to start a holiday but I guess this property is simply a transit stay for early morning next day flights. the smell of burnt toast at 5am in the morning was also a bit off putting."
4873,Jeff,2022-05-11,4.5,"Superb Location convenience, Room excellent Staff very helpful"

4876,John,2022-05-07,3.5,"Decent stay at Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport Check in was excellent, really attentive, genuinely friendly and helpful. I travel a lot and so often reception and check in is awful. It's the first contact the guest has with the hotel and important to be right. Room was comfortable, clean and generally quiet. Asked for a quiet room away from lift traffic and was accommodated. Food ordering system and other pushy customers jumping the queue. Appeared that some groups had package holiday vouchers which, to them, meant entitlement and special treatment. It's a package holiday airport hotel so I suppose that is to be expected. Food was OK, bar team very helpful given the circumstances."
4877,Frank,2022-05-07,4.5,"great hotel for early or late airport arrival quick check in, good breakfast and nice rooms"

4883,Kevin,2022-05-05,4.0,So comfortable and convenient for an early flight. Hot Breakfast is very good. Early cold breakfast is available from 4.00 hrs for early flights. Evening meal is very limited and is obviously frozen and microwave/oven but nicely presented. There is a bar which includes limited draught beers.
4884,Russell,2022-05-05,4.0,"Very nice hotel, great location, but the price had gone up a lot The airport location, cleanliness and staff friendliness were excellent The price had gone up significantly compared to other times I've booked this."

4886,Susan,2022-05-04,3.5,"Comfortable, good welcome but could have done more for very early morning flight food Good location The hotel were fully aware of earlier check outs ,telling us to get to the airport by 4am but breakfast started at 4am so in my opinion knowing the ongoing problems at airports ,should have had 3.30am access to continental breakfast at least or bread roll jam and butter in room come on Hampton !"
4887,Mike,2022-05-04,4.5,Superb Spacious clean hotel right at the airport. .Early check-in was a bit annoying. We had to join the Hilton club to check-in early.

4893,Stephen,2022-04-30,4.5,"very convenient for airport, clean modern hotel very convenient for airport"
4894,Barbara,2022-04-28,3.5,"Late night arrival hotel stay The location is ideal for a very late arrival flight. The room is clean and the bed comfy. Lots of choice at breakfast. I received many messages to use the online key, but it wouldn't activate, although I continued to receive more messages to use it. The cooked breakfast is luke warm and over cooked."
4895,Linda,2022-04-28,4.0,Very good Location is excellent. Room very clean. Evening meal starter and main were both lukewarm. Breakfast no eggs. Not enough room at side of bed.

4900,Jeffrey,2022-04-27,4.0,We enjoyed our stay but we found it expensive and would only use it on certain occasions. Continental breakfast adequate. The position to the airport was perfect and the room was adequate for the night and very clean. It is a Hotel that is used by the airport passenger and as such is very good.
4901,Kim,2022-04-26,4.0,"Expensive for what it was 2 minutes walk to airport terminal iron, ironing board & hairdryer in room. Quiet room, great shower. room had everything needed for 1 night stay Wake up call not received, could have missed flight had we not set alarm on phone Early morning breakfast is buffet which is to be expected at 4.30am but breakfast area very messy. Evening meal was poor"
4902,Iwona,2022-04-26,4.5,"Superb Nice, clean and comfortable room in good location"
4903,Mrs,2022-04-26,4.0,"Perfect for a relaxed, comfortable pre flight stay. Easy check in, comfortable and quiet room. Good food menu although several items were out of stock. What we had was very nice, however. Nicely stocked bathroom, comfy mattress so we slept well and it was a fast check out. Also able to walk to the airport easily. One long queue to order food and drink which meant we couldn't be bothered to order more drinks. One lady decided to walk over to the airport to get something instead."
4904,Philip,2022-04-26,4.5,Superb convenient for the airport very quiet pricey
4905,Juan,2022-04-25,3.5,Good Breakfast cold and not fresh at 7am. Poor facilities upon arrival 10pm. Rather expensive for what is no more than a premier inn type hotel. See above
4906,Leonard,2022-04-25,4.0,"Reasonable, but overpriced stay Excellent location on the airport site Very expensive for an airport hotel"
4907,Bernard,2022-04-24,4.0,Great location BUT.. .V convenient for the terminal V limited food choice in the restaurant. Carpet in the room was dirty and beneath the bed was unsavoury. No trolleys available at the hotel to transport luggage to the terminal. No instructions for using the heating system.. it was either too hot or too cold. It was always noisy.
4908,Cheryl,2022-04-24,3.5,"Good place to stay for Bristol airport, would recomend. Easy check in, with friendly staff and a nice welcome. Parking was easy. Communication before arrival was excellent. Cleanliness of room was excellent and comfortable bed. An extra pillow would have been nice. The coffee and tea tray would have benefitted from a biscuit as well. No internet charging socket was available which would have been really useful."
4909,Holly,2022-04-22,3.5,"Would book again, hopefully they will sort out the breakfast issue. Good location, nice rooms which were all very clean. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was dry and unappealing even though I came down 10 min after it was served. They didn’t have lids on the food under the heat lamps so the eggs, mushrooms etc had all dried out."
4910,Tegid,2022-04-22,4.0,Excellent location. We will certainly stay there again if we fly from Bristol Rooms are well designed Breakfast was OK but after a week in nice Spanish hotels was a bit of a let down

Can't really find any fault."
4913,Margaret,2022-04-21,4.0,"excellent , fulfilled the purpose proximity to airport. wonderful breakfast included and served from 4 am no views from bedroom window"
4914,Caroline,2022-04-20,4.5,Great location for early flights from Bristol airport. Great location on site at Bristol airport - just a few minutes walk to terminal. Rooms were better than expected - comfy beds and good shower. No bags available for the grab and go breakfast and we didn’t have time to eat in. Quite expensive for a family for one short night.
4915,Lewis,2022-04-19,4.4,Fabulous Easy to get to and very convenient for the airport in the morning. The bar closed at 10 and then after was only room service. No parking packages so you can only leave your car for the duration of your stay. (Previously this was different)
4916,Jacqueline,2022-04-19,4.0,"Very good Food was excellent and staff were helpful and friendly Only one pillow, and the one pillow we had was too soft"
4917,Ian,2022-04-19,3.5,pleasant stay what I expected location menu could have been better
4918,Rosalind,2022-04-19,4.5,Best option for getting some sleep before/after late/early flights Convenience second to none. Staff always friendly. Great that you accommodate families with children in a room with a sofa bed; if you ever stopped doing that we would look elsewhere!
4919,Mark,2022-04-19,4.0,Very good Really helpful
4920,Esther,2022-04-18,4.5,Superb A few minutes walk from the terminal so ideal for an early morning flight. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Breakfast served from 4am.

4922,Sabine,2022-04-17,3.5,"good sleep, good breakfast, very relaxed arriving at the airport. 5 min Walk to the airport, perfect for an early departure or late arrival. the room was nice with a sofa that opened for a bed. breakfast starts as early at 4, the cooked breakfast at 6. we had time for the English breakfast and enjoyed it. we heard no planes in the room. the bed felt really uncomfortable, but we still slept really good. I found it quite expensive but I guess the easy airport access makes a part up fort it."
4923,Sue,2022-04-17,4.0,Very good where it’s situated not enough pillows please pop more on
4924,Sarah,2022-04-17,3.5,"Good location for the airport as just a short walk but you are paying a premium for the convenience The hotel was really near the airport and had ample parking. Breakfast was available for early travellers. It was expensive for just one night as not a high brow hotel. The food was pretty basic, you could tell came from a supermarket, but cooked well."
4925,David,2022-04-16,3.5,Very satisfactory and the discount on overnight parking was much appreciated Good breakfast The eating area a bit utilitarian and the tables seemed sticky
4926,Bowler,2022-04-16,4.0,Easter 2022 The food was excellent. Very clean and the staff were very nice Nothing for the children to do. It would have been nice to have a adventure play ground or something where the children could remove some of there excessive amount of energy
4927,Jane,2022-04-16,4.0,Good start to the holiday. Fairly good choice. Available to take away at 4am which was very good. Very little choice for evening meal.
4928,Tracey,2022-04-16,4.0,"Very good It's a great location, clean and comfortable The exterior automatic doors weren't working. There was no sign to explain that, they were very difficult to open and even the staff didn't comment or apologise"

4932,Alex,2022-04-14,4.0,Very good Good stay for early flight next morning
4933,Dawn,2022-04-14,4.5,"Peaceful, comfortable retreat. Loved that it was within walking distance of the airport terminal and yet was remarkably quiet - inside you could not hear all the planes landing and taking off at all hours. My international flight was at 6am so I had to be at the terminal at 4am and was too early for any breakfast."
4934,Joanna,2022-04-12,3.5,convenient close to terminal bed like rock black mould inside shower screen at the base
4935,Jones,2022-04-11,4.0,"Very good Convenient for airport Outward - 5.15am no croissants. Homeward-cooked breakfast cold and hard food. Not enough staff, they were really busy 1 staff on reception but a phone call took them away and left people waiting. 1 staff on drink/food, needs 2"

4939,Jane,2022-04-08,4.0,Very good Convenient for airport and parking Restaurant and menu rather basic.
4940,Laura,2022-04-08,4.0,"Modern hotel with lovely staff, could improve menu options The front desk staff were super friendly and went above and beyond to ensure we didn't pay any extra for parking or late checkout. Even though there was no room service available we asked the staff and they allowed us to collect the food from the restaurant and take it back to the room with us. The room was modern and clean, we weren't woken up by any noise from the airport or other guests. The complementary breakfast had everything you could want. There weren't a tonne of food options for the evening meal, mostly fast food like burgers, pizza, potato wedges, and a daily dish (one meat, one vegan). Because of the location there aren't any other places to eat, so you're really stuck with just the selection there."
4941,Sophie,2022-04-08,3.5,Much better than I ever expected Close to airport Nothing

4949,Anne,2022-04-04,3.5,"A decent sleep before driving home It was good to be able to stay overnight after a long day before driving home. The hotel is close to the terminal and car park so it doesn't take long to reach either on foot. Dinner and breakfast both OK but not special, staff friendly and room comfortable. Our room was quite far from reception and we were tired. When we stayed the night before departure we were on the ground floor quite close to reception which would have better suited a couple of pensioners!"
4950,Hemina,2022-04-04,3.5,"The breakfast is good, the rooms are quiet and it’s a short walk to the airport. Convenient to the airport"

4954,Annabel,2022-04-03,4.5,"A great airport hotel, super service and very clean rooms which are a step up from a standard hotel. We didn’t manage breakfast as early check in, but the ease of parking, getting to the hotel from the carpark and then the terminal from the hotel was fantastic. The rooms were lovely too. Dinner was great in the hotel restaurant. I don’t have suggestions"
4955,Olivia,2022-04-03,4.0,convenient but little soul adjacent to airport not much character in rooms. The woodwork was like Travelodge
4956,Kim,2022-04-02,4.0,too tired to return to desk to devise re bloody tissue in lift otherwise okay close to airport really lovely toiletries accessible shower was amazing great choice at breakfast easy check in/check out Blood stained (what looked like) tissue in one of lifts.

We were taking an early morning flight and were very disappointed that there were no paper cups for us to get a coffee ‘on the go’ as there have been in the past - so no breakfast for us either as we don’t eat pastries. The hotel also needs some lighting to the outside of the main doors, it was very dark out there!"

4983,Andrew,2022-03-22,4.0,convenient and comfy it was convenient and comfy
4984,Margaret,2022-03-21,3.5,"Great location and comfortable room but dire dining Pleasant clean and modern room, very quiet and comfortable. Breakfast is laid on from 4am, hot food from 6am and you can take away portable items if you don’t have time. Very close to airport terminal. The food and dining experience was on the level of a motorway services, and not the good services like Gloucester and Tebay either. You are effectively eating in the foyer, unable to get away from screens with football and the food itself is barely edible and certainly not wholesome, being largely white carb. The red lentil Dahl for £12.95 was very overpriced, devoid of flavour or spice. The felafel burger was also a very long way from the original concept. There is no signage to the hotel if you want to find a pedestrian/wheeled luggage route from the long stay car park to the hotel. If you are foolish enough to consider dropping off passengers and luggage before parking think again as a van patrols the airport looking for reasons to dine you £100. Happily we could park near enough in the end."
4985,Bryan,2022-03-21,4.5,well worth stay On-site for early morning flight nothing to fault

4999,Vanessa,2022-03-16,4.5,"It did the trick! The room was spacious, warm and comfortable. Really good facilities. We had supper which was fine and did what we needed it to do. We missed out on breakfast as we needed to get to the airport 2 hours before the 6 a.m. flight - never mind. I think windows not opening for me was the one thing I would have liked as I always sleep with a window open no matter what the weather is like. Circulating fresh air is always best."
5000,Ian,2022-03-15,3.5,"Good hotel, perfect spot, don't plan to leave your car there Simple, clean and as you would expect for a Hampton by the airport, breakfast was good and the room was comfortable. A bottle of water in the room is surely a basic expectation. Possibly my naivety, but I read the parking fee is a reduced £8 a day flat rate if you stay here, so planned to leave the car there for the 2 nights we were away, but its only £8 for the nights you stay there, then it jumps to £45, then £19 a night, so don't plan to leave your car here for your trip."
5001,Katrina,2022-03-14,4.0,Perfect for what we wanted for one night and an early start Ideal location for airport and long stay parking Menu in restaurant could be more varied but

5005,Xabiahelen,2022-03-13,4.0,Good hotel and perfect for Bristol airport. We didn't have breakfast as we had to be at the airport for 5.25am. Being so close to the terminal was good and only took us 5 minutes to walk there with our luggage. The room was comfortable but a little too cool for my husband.

Particularly liked the quality of the coffee which was excellent. Only one quibble - could have had some extra pillows in the room. My wife usually requires additional pillows due to a health condition.
5023,Thomas,2022-03-06,3.5,Good The doors at the entrance did not work correctly There was only two coffee machines at breakfast only one working and the second in bad repair

The rooms are clean and comfortable and there’s a restaurant on site which is handy, serving breakfast from around 5am."
5026,Heather,2022-03-06,4.0,"Very good Hotel is walking distance from the airport terminal. Reception staff were excellent - efficient, smiling, nothing was too much trouble. They have a safe luggage room if you want to leave your bags there. Also there are airport trolleys behind the hotel which you pay for and can then you can keep the trolley and some of your bags in the reception safe luggage room. Excellent for if you have an early departure. Bar staff were very friendly. Room spacious & comfortable - no noise from the airport."

5035,Helen,2022-03-03,4.5,"Massively convenient hotel for Bristol airport. This airport is on the doorstep of Bristol airport - a short walk, so massively convenient. The parking at the multi-story is also convenient and although expensive, we got a reasonable deal as we pre-booked. It's a nice touch having the boards up with the flights - really helpful to know whether to walk over or wait. The signage could be better - we ended up taking a long walk detour to get to the right walkway, when we could have gone through the hotel and walked out the other side - a simple thing to rectify if the owners choose to do so!"
5036,Peter,2022-03-03,4.5,"Convenient hotel, spotlessly clean with amazing staff and a good breakfast close to Bristol Airport. The staff were really helpful and friendly at the check in. We couldn’t get a taxi to take us to Bristol Temple Meads ( Sunday 27th Feb) and they went out of their way to go and find us a taxi, calling taxi companies, going up to the airport taxi rank etc. Nothing was was too much trouble for them. They were amazing ⭐️ It’s a bit far from the airport."

5061,Chris,2022-02-21,4.0,"Very good Facilities and room are super. Breakfast available at 5AM, amazing. Very convenient for the airport, makes it super easy to get to your flight in the morning.

Room and en-suite were very well equipped and the beds were comfortable. Walking distance to airport terminal. No night light or dimmer switch to facilitate access to bathroom at night without switching on main light which also reflects in mirror. A ramp from the hotel to the airport next to the steps would be better."

Having said that, we would use again."
5082,Andrea,2022-02-10,4.5,"Short but sweet, great airport hotel.

5115,Linda,2022-01-20,4.0,Very good close to airport no trollers available nearby & quite a few steps to get to airport

5118,Michelle,2022-01-17,4.5,"Superb Comfortable bed, lovely hot shower, friendly staff,really great variety of breakfast. Ideal location,well efficient in regards to hygiene for covid. Room was cold. Annoyed having to walk all around the hotel because the entry signage had fallen off."
5119,Rebecca,2022-01-17,4.0,comfortable. clean. great staff clean. well kept. good fascilities the only disappointment was the crockery and utensils were not clean. which is very important especially with COVID
5120,Gillian,2022-01-16,3.5,Good Location Evening meal was basic
5121,Alan,2022-01-16,3.5,"Location is the star. We went down for breakfast at 06.30, so no hot food available for breakfast. Why can’t hot food be provided? Our bed was rather hard, also when one of us moved the other felt the bounce."
5122,Go4it,2022-01-16,4.5,"Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport - an excellent location for the airport The hotel was spotlessly clean, continental breakfast very good and excellent location for the airport. Nothing"
5123,Ann,2022-01-16,4.5,"Excellent airport hotel with great staff Comfortable room close to airport. Very friendly, helpful and professional staff. Good attention to Covid procedures. Very good breakfast with impressive choice for such an early start (4.30am was when we went) - hot breakfast starts at 6am. We checked out access to airport the day before our flight: you can get a luggage trolley from near the hotel for £2 and use the ramped access to the terminal (we are in our 70s so it solved the problem of trying to lug heavy cases up flights of steps). We have booked again for our return flight."
5124,Manoj,2022-01-15,4.0,Very good close to the airport

5131,Dawn,2022-01-12,4.0,Comfortable stay in a convenient location for Bristol Airport The hotel is very convenient for the airport for an early morning flight
5132,Simon,2022-01-12,4.0,"nice facility, clean, comfy and convenient… but eat before you stay. convenience. clean, modern and just what you need for a short (overnight stay) food in the restaurant was highly processed.. didn’t think you could make a bad cheese and bacon burger, but they managed it.. beef was finely ground patty and the bacon was anaemic…. should be able to do much better.."
5133,Alan,2022-01-11,4.0,"Very good Proximity to airport Comfortable room Excellent breakfast Evening meal was poor value, and the frozen vegetables were cold and unappetising. The meal was not up to hotel standards. General atmosphere of the dining area was cold and spartan. Stained upholstery and inadequate cleaning by staff"
5134,Sarah,2022-01-11,4.0,"Very convenient for an early start at the airport The room was very clean and comfortable and quiet. We had the continental breakfast as we had an early flight which was very well laid out and plentiful. The pillows were too soft We had evening dinner at the hotel but it took nearly an hour to arrive, which was not good, we complained and they gave us a round of free drinks as a gesture of good will. When the food was finally served it was nice and hot."
5135,Shirley,2022-01-11,4.0,"Very convenient clean facilities and lovely staff. Staff were lovely and very helpful. Room and facilities were very clean. Very accessible for airport terminal - couldn't have been any better. Pillows were so soft they were virtually non existent. No neck support at all. No second pillows available to provide extra support. Could not lie in bed and watch TV as could not prop yourself up enough. A small gripe I know but a little bit irritating, especially when everything else was absolutely fine."
5136,John,2022-01-11,4.5,"Good quality pre-flight stopover at market price Proximity to airport terminal; positive attitude of staff; good continental breakfast available very early (from 4.00am) Very little to dislike, other than the price!"

5141,Roely,2022-01-07,4.0,Perfect for the purpose Position very close to airport.?
5142,Denise,2022-01-07,4.0,Fitted our purpose very well. Breakfast was very good. Great to accommodate early departures. My second visit and would stay again. Choice for dinner.
5143,Diana,2022-01-07,4.5,Good value and very pleasant and clean Great location for airport. Breakfast was good Would have liked natural dairy yoghurt and a sharp knife for fruit

5145,Lynne,2022-01-06,4.0,Very good comfy bed room too stuffy
5146,Ann,2022-01-05,4.0,"Very good Did the job for 1night. Long up hill walk to airport terminal, should provide shuttle bus."
5147,Raymund,2022-01-05,4.5,"We enjoyed the stay, the staff were excellent, the location ideal and cleanliness was superb. Breakfast was ok but if I was being honest the ingredients were quite average. The location right next to the airport was super convenient for covid testing and the flight we were taking. There was nothing much to complain about. Perhaps some extra signage to advise which exit to use for the airport when you had arrived via the car park entrance. Some extra pillows would have been nice since the booking was for a couple."
5148,Nazir,2022-01-05,4.0,Very good Clean rooms Heating in the room did not work too well. Food at the restaurant was really bad!
5149,Margaretta,2022-01-05,4.5,"Quiet rooms ,very convenient hotel ,short walk to the terminal of Bristol Airport . Excellent hotel to catch an early fl so convenient for the airport, facilities good"
5150,Markbrins,2022-01-04,4.0,Walking distance to terminal The bar prices were reasonable for both food and drinks
5151,David,2022-01-04,4.5,very clean hotel. very clean and very conveniently located downhill from the airport. not easy to carry/wheel cases uphill to the airport.
5152,Joanna,2022-01-04,4.5,"I would definitely stay at this hotel again for its convenient position close to Bristol Airport. The breakfast was a great self-service set up and good early start for those having to check-in for an early flight from Bristol Airport. A shame the waffle maker wasn't up and running early, but understandable. Having the live flight departures and arrivals information up in the restaurant area was helpful and reassuring. Initially, I was put off by the parking price information when I first arrived, but after visiting the hotel reception I learned that customers of the hotel paid a reduced overnight price which was far more bearable. It would be better if customers didn't have to pay for parking for the duration of their stay."
5153,Keith,2022-01-03,3.5,Ok Location was good did not have breakfast left to early No USB port stairs hadn’t been cleaned for a while ok
5154,Samantha,2022-01-03,4.5,"Fabulous and super friendly! We have stayed in many hotels all over the world but the customer service here was fabulous and up there with the best. So warm and genuine. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff really seem to enjoy working at the hotel and it shows. We were only at the hotel for 1 night but were made to feel so welcome from the moment we checked in. The restaurant was great too. Decent menu, service, quality and prices. It all felt very safe despite Covid and restrictions. The room was spotless. The very short distance from the airport terminal made it super convenient and there was ample parking outside. I honestly hate to leave any negative comment as the positives were so good but it would have been nice to have a bath in the room. I kind of expect that of a Hilton. The sofa bed's springs also dug in during the night but the soft quilt kind of helped detract from that!"
5155,Valerie,2022-01-03,4.5,Great for early flight Breakfast excellent No hairdryer in room
5156,Peter,2022-01-02,4.0,Short and convenient.. Flight was too early for breakfast. Hotel is convenient for early flights. Expensive
5157,Martin,2022-01-02,4.0,very convenient for airport so near the terminal very little room between the bed and the wall. the bed was very hard
5158,Nicola,2022-01-02,3.5,Perfect for what we needed and the staff were so helpful - would stay again Very clean and the staff were super helpful and friendly Food was quite basic - was ok but more choice as I would imagine a lot of people want to start a holiday staying here with a lovely meal
5159,Griffiths,2022-01-01,4.5,Superb Excellent location bang opposite Bristol airport. Great staff. Good food. Lovely shower!!! Comfy bed and quiet. One of the lifts shuddering! But apart from that all was great.
5160,Fuller,2021-12-31,4.5,Superb Clean functional room. Delicious breakfast and excellent selection. Helpful staff Furnishings were a little tired. Some carpets appear stained/dirty. Tables slow to be cleaned.
5161,John,2021-12-31,4.5,"accommodation fine but food appalling everything except the evening meal and bar At the Hampton our room and facilities were fine but the food at our evening meal was more than disappointing. It was probably the most unappetising food we have experienced. We had the falafel veggie burger described on the Menu as being with bread and butter pickle, tzatziki and chips, which were just cooked and only warm. The item came with ‘salad’, which was not described in the menu and which we were told was standard for a burger being lettuce, tomato, and onion. Not everyone likes onion and removing it from food after it has been sliced is equally unacceptable. It should be recognised on the menu, for customers to have a choice. The ‘bread and butter’ description was false as it was a Brioche, which is a sweet bun and totally unsatisfactory in a savoury dish. Staff and Manager were accommodating and helpful in accepting our criticism of the food. The bar serves only malt Scotch Whisky and Irish Whiskey which is an unacceptable and expensive choice when requiring a long whisky drink with a mixer ie ginger ale, where a Blended Scotch Whisky is the norm. These are supplied under numerous titles such as White&Mackay, Bells, Grouse, etc. etc. It feels like your captive audience is being held hostage."
5162,Sarah,2021-12-31,4.0,Fine for an overnight Very helpful and friendly check in from Gloria. Dining area and bar somewhat basic.
5163,Elizabeth,2021-12-30,4.5,We enjoyed another stay. It was very comfortable and welcome after a long day travelling. it’s extremely convenient if you are flying out of or into Bristol Airport I would like to know there is a courtesy bus to transfer you to and from the airport. Taxis are exorbitant and totally off the scale for such a short trip. It’s the only drawback.
5164,Dorothy,2021-12-30,4.0,excellent The location - took the stress out of an early flight nothing
5165,Andrew,2021-12-30,4.0,"Very good  Sanitation stations not filled to capacity, during the evening one was empty reported three times, and once to the Duty Manager next morning still empty 29/12/2021 reported yet again instantly changed by the morning staff. Very disgruntled that a senior team member did not follow up any action during his evening shift."

5167,Ana,2021-12-28,4.0,Very good How near from airport is this location. The room and the hotel were absolutely spotless. The breakfast was really nice. Just maybe the price for just one night was a bit expensive. But in general I really enjoyed my stay.

5170,Duncan,2021-12-27,4.0,good but not without some disadvantages for passengers on very early flights convenient stay if you have an early morning flight had to leave hotel to check in for a very early flight. No coffee or snacks available although we had paid for breakfast.
5171,Elizabeth,2021-12-26,4.0,"Comfortable, friendly Location perfect for airport. Bed comfortable and quiet. Staff were very friendly. Check in and out very easy. Stains on bedroom carpet. Not enough staff, queues for the bar and to order food."

5175,Bill,2021-12-23,4.5,Superb How clean and spacious also right on the Airport
5176,Susan,2021-12-22,4.0,Convenient comfortable hotel to stay in for early departure from the airport. The location is excellent for the airport. Breakfast was a bit disappointing as the cooked option was late coming out & we did not have time before our check in to take advantage of it. However what was available was fine. We liked the idea that rooms were sealed after cleaning to comply with COVID regulations. Unfortunately a good number of people moving around the hotel were not wearing masks although we do realise that is something it's difficult for the hotel to enforce.
5177,Heaney,2021-12-22,4.5,Very happy. Would definitely stay again. Breakfast was great. Plenty of choice.
5178,Jo,2021-12-21,4.5,Superb So close to the airport - perfect for my early flight. They offered take away breakfast too for early flights. I didn't realise that I could park at the hotel so in future I will do that.
5179,Antony,2021-12-21,4.5,Kids in lobby  Children being allowed to run around in the lobby while others were trying to socially acceptably distance and eat or relax other guests should have been spoken to about their tolerance level of their children

5187,Michael,2021-12-16,4.0,Very comfortable stay Evening meal good value and tasty. Staff pleasant and helpful. Convenient to airport terminal. upon booking it would have been helpful for guidance of location of long term car park and where best to park to reach the hotel on foot. Terminal direction signs in car park do not mention hotel and at night quite difficult to find the best pedestrian route. Now we know the layout will not be a problem in future.
5188,Keith,2021-12-16,4.0,Very good Excellent staff.Giving good service in difficult times.Early buffet breakfast very good. Prices bit high if you had family to cater for.
5189,Raymond,2021-12-15,3.5,Perfect for the airport Good room and very convenient for the airport. The cutlery at breakfast was filthy! Knives were encrusted with baked on food. Staff should be more careful when removing them from the dishwasher.

5195,Whittler,2021-12-12,4.0,"Very convenient, clean and well presented hotel Extremely convenient location situated a short walk between the multi storey car park and the terminal. Good size room, excellent bathroom. The website advised that food wasn't available in the evening so we took a prepared meal with u to eat in our room. On arrival there was clearly a good choice of food available via the bar."
5196,Noel,2021-12-11,3.5,"Perfect location, bit disappointed thereafter The location couldn't be better! The bed was very comfortable. It was expensive for what it was, I was surprised there were no USB charging points in the room. I had some time to kill in the morning before my afternoon flight and whilst waiting for my afternoon flight I ordered a tea and bottle of water which was hellish expensive and the water was only 330ml. I would have asked for a pint of tap water if I knew I'd be fleeced. Even the guy that served me seemed embarrassed."
5197,Martin,2021-12-10,4.5,Perfect night-before choice for that early flight Lovely staff. Just 5 minutes walk to airport terminal. Excellent size rooms. Limited choice of evening meal
5198,Mandy,2021-12-09,4.0,"Very convenient for airport. Proximity to airport and airport bus terminal. Very clean, quiet, great beds and bathroom. Breakfast could be of a higher quality - orange juice was like squash, croissants a bit dry, etc."

5205,Terrance,2021-12-08,4.5,will definately stay again good beds very clean Packed breakfast for 6.00am departures would have been good
5206,Rhian,2021-12-06,4.5,"Would definitely recommend. The room was lovely, modern and very clean. Beds comfortable. Large walk in shower too which was great! Location was amazing. Airport a 5 min walk away. The front of desk was lovely as well. He made us feel very welcome. The food. Ordered a jacket potato it was brown 🤢 my sister ordered a tuna sandwich and the bread was stale. Needs improving."

Room nothing special for the money charged beds very hard"
5208,Kevin,2021-12-05,4.0,Nice but expensive The location is superb and the rooms are excellent Over 200 pounds for one night
5209,Ian,2021-12-05,3.5,The hotel is convenient for the terminal and that is reflected in the room rates. Given that a lot of guests were taking early flights the start of service should be earlier. The continental offer was average. My comments are influenced by one member of staff who was taking food and beverage orders. I was queuing behind a customer waiting to be served when she came to the counter ignored me and served the person behind me while I was still waiting. That was rude and doesn’t go down well with us Brits.
5210,Caroline,2021-12-05,4.5,Superb Location was the key factor
5211,Simon,2021-12-05,4.0,it’s an airport hotel - efficient and soulless  I know it’s in the airport but it’s still a lot of money for a room in the Bristol area

5217,Julie,2021-12-02,4.0,Very good Proximity of the Airport. Breakfast. Hotel food was of poor quality.
5218,Julie,2021-12-02,4.0,Overnight Airport Stay This was an overnight stay at an airport hotel. It was comfortable and close to the airport. We also got a later check out which was much appreciated. Self service breakfast was excellent. The food menu was limited the chilli I had lacked meat and taste.
5219,Peter,2021-12-01,4.0,A comfortable stay in an ideal location for an early flight. It is a shame you cannot get better food options. It is very convenient for an early flight. Food options are limited.

5222,Clive,2021-12-01,4.0,"Great food, lovely people, lumpy, noisy mattress. Evening meal and breakfast was hot and good quality. Chelsea was great looked after us wonderfully. It Was without doubt the worst bed I have ever slept in..the mattress was at least 50 years old.. which was strange for a new hotel. And one pillow each on the bed... really whats that about."
5223,Rosamund,2021-11-29,4.0,convenient location but seriously consider eating elsewhere excellent location for the airport particularly when you have an early flight. comfortable and quiet room & very clean. the evening menu choices are very limited. it completely lets the hotel down. The menu is not in keeping with the quality of the accommodation. For some it is the beginning of a holiday & a good meal would be a great way to start.
5224,Hazel,2021-11-29,4.0,Overall a positive experience. Breakfast was expected and good. The hotel very modern. The walk from airport arrivals lounge to the hotel late at night was dimly lit. I will be writing to the airport authorities re this. The walk ways need weatherproofing ie; covered against the rain. I will be writing to the airport authorities re this! Arrived very late due to flight delays.

5233,Jennifer,2021-11-27,4.5,"It is the best airport hotel I have stayed in. Within a few minutes walk from the airport, it is clean, comfortable, with very pleasant and helpful staff. A cold breakfast begins at 4am, which is very good. the hot breakfast begins at 6am. The room is designed to maximise the space, is clean and comfortable. It is the best airport hotel I have stayed in. Nothing."
5234,Peter,2021-11-25,4.0,"Convenient and comfortable Would have liked to have seen an opportunity to have a take away arrangement as we had an early flight and left the hotel at 05.00 am.

Perfect location. The breakfast was very sparse, a small selection of cold cuts and breads and the shower water could have been a little warmer,"
5239,Martin,2021-11-23,4.5,"Staff, room and breakfast excellent but let down by the charges pending still remain Excellent Breakfast. Everything you'd want from a cooked breakfast The amount from the previous week was showing even though it was claimed by the 15th. After the stay on the 20th November 3 amounts were still showing pending. The charge was £112 which has been claimed but 2 pending items remain. Not good enough 3 days after the stay."

It arrived quickly and was piping hot and immaculately served. Thank you. I am elderly and have stayed here several times as it means I can easily walk to the airport after a longish train journey, from Cornwall, then a bus trip from Temple Meads Station and it makes my life easier. I prefer to have a room with a bath, otherwise it was warm clean and comfortable. All the staff were lovely. To have a room with a bath and shower head."

The staff were very welcoming and helpful at all times The only thing I was disappointed in there were no teabags in the room and I felt it was too late 10pm to ask staff plus I was tired but I was so looking forward to a cup of tea - small things but important at the time! Also the bins had not been emptied. When showering in the morning the water was not draining away in the tray and had to turn it off!! Room 157

The friendlness of the staff and the superb response to our request for an additional duvet and pillow each on our arrival in the cold night on return from Tenerife, all this at about 1 am. Much appreciated. The sudden closure of the breakfast area doors without notice. We understood breakfast was from 7 till 11 but didn't expect that!"

Well designed, beautifully clean with all the elements needed for a restful stay. Staff were very friendly and helpful with a genuine will to want to give great customer service. My check in was the best I’ve ever had in a hotel. We had to check out at 4am so was disappointed that takeaway breakfast was not available. A take away coffee would have been very welcome! If I’m unable to have time to enjoy breakfast I should be offered a reduction in rate or a takeaway."

I understand about the increase in cost of cleaning and difficulty in getting staff, but since I had a 6am flight I did not really have any choice, as there are also less flights to choose from."

5325,Duncan,2021-10-16,4.0,We like the functionality of design and service: it's just right for a before and after flight stay. Check in easy and that's what was needed at 2300 after along tiring day. Male member of staff friendly and sensitive to our exhaustion! Room clean and bed comfortable. Shower and towels excellent. Breakfast varied and welcome. Two pillows rather than one. Too late at night for us to feel like requesting this though on our next stay we shall do this in advance.
5326,Rona,2021-10-16,4.5,Perfect place to crash after a late landing flight Great location. Very good breakfast choice Room was bit small & hot

Everything was very well equipped, superbly comfortably and super Covid clean. I felt very safe there as a senior solo female. A bit pricey, but almost totally worth it for the convenience."
5330,Peter,2021-10-14,4.0,"Excellent position for an early flight The location alone is worth the price. This trip the breakfast exceed my expectations, you don't expect cooked at 4 in the morning and the choice of meat cheese and fruit was an improvement on my last trip. All the staff in interacted with were 100% except the guy at check out, he was 110% when I'd forgotten my jacket in the room, he looked after my bags without fuss, well done I didn't like having to order food from the bar, last time my order was taken at the table (because of COVID-19) it was not busy and could have been accommodated. This meant I had to carry my belongings rather than leave them on the table. The bathroom is excellent but unfortunately this time there was a bad sludge arould the seal of the shower tray, had I stayed more than one night I would have expected a change of room, given the price paid"
5331,Rhodes,2021-10-13,4.0,Very good Speed of check-in & out; practical Covid responses; good room layout Nothing - all was excellent

5338,Rhianydd,2021-10-11,4.5,"Superb The bed was so comfortable we extended our check out time! We arrived late at night after a very long flight so tried to order a pizza which was advertised as a 24 hour product. We were told We had to go down to reception to order, and there were only cold sandwiches available. Not a massive deal but not as advertised either."
5339,Olly,2021-10-09,4.0,Very good Varied options. Good coffee. Practical self service.
5340,Phil,2021-10-09,4.0,"It was convenient, handy - an overall OK stay but couple of minor issues meant it wasn't excellent Walking distance from the terminal. Late night check-in was easy. Receptionist was very friendly and welcoming. We could get a drink in the bar even though it was late. Bathroom had a strange smell on first entering. May have been from lack of use or cleaning products. It was gone by morning. Breakfast was a little disappointing - though there was a good variety, what I had lacked in flavour. For the price of the room I expected an excellent breakfast."
5341,Oopsididitagain,2021-10-08,4.0,"Airport overnight stay Spacious room, very clean, very close to the airport, food & drinks available, comfy bed I wish there’s a bath tub available in the room.

5346,Michelle,2021-10-06,4.5,"Exactly what was needed Super easy check in by helpful staff, again when we checked out. Lovely clean room. Nice breakfast External signage and lighting. Could be better signposted, but if they had all the lights on it would have been easier to spot"
5347,Emma,2021-10-06,4.0,Good overnighted for airport Reception staff very helpful. Best thing is parking your car and then knowing you just have to walk 2 mins in morning to airport. Food menu pretty basic but food good.
5348,Terry,2021-10-06,4.0,"Good, but could have been better.  Reception could not find our original booking!!,and told us that we were lucky to get a room as the hotel was full. This was pretty stressful at the time. Also, despite notifying the hotel of our earlier than check in arrival time, we could not use the gym"
5349,Roger,2021-10-05,4.0,Very good Breakfast was cold (cooked breakfast). Warmer cooked breakfast.

5352,Ioana,2021-10-05,3.5,"Good The position is key here, given the lack of competition so close to the airport. The hotel is not yet old, and there is a certain brand standard that is nice to be able to rely on. Fabulous beds, nice shower and always good to have a powerful hairdryer available. The dinner was super-decent and not expensive, the WiFi signal strong and reliable for my needs, even for live streaming. Staff were generally very nice and helpful. There was something to eat even at 4am, which was helpful. A bit of maintenance is already needed; in my room none of the power outlets by the bed worked; I was lucky that the cables I had with me were long enough to use the ones by the desk. Rather disappointingly none of my calls to the front desk were answered."
5353,Smith,2021-10-05,4.0,Good pre-departure airport stay Works well as an airport hotel for pre-flight. It's also great that the breakfast is available very early in the morning The food offer is basic & could be improved
5354,Caryn,2021-10-04,4.0,"Very convenient for catching flights from the airport We didn't have time for breakfast due to early morning flight although we were able to take some muffins and pastries with us to the airport as some food available at 4.00am There wasn't anything we didn't like, although next time we come it would be good if there was more evening meal selections"

5356,Peter,2021-10-03,3.5,"Convenient for airport - a good choice if travelling early morning. The location - near the airport and car parks. Clean and tidy, though quite basic, room. Everything worked fine. The staff were very helpful. It will be our hotel of choice when using Bristol airport. Shame a covered walkway couldn't have been designed in to reach the terminal. Expected a bit more in the way of food - limited choice. Expected more for the price paid. Had the feel of a budget hotel."

5364,Kathryn,2021-09-27,4.0,"A typical airport hotel where you are there of one night only. Most things were to my satisfaction. Everything was as it should be, the room clean and tidy. The Receptionists were very helpful with instructing me to collect a trolley, and then they stored it, for me, in the Luggage Room, to assist with my baggage and early morning 4am start. There is a ramp up to the airport that made pushing a laden trolley much easier. I thought the menu was very poor, giving an extremely limited choice. If you liked any type of burger you were catered for! I plumped for Cream of Tomato Soup - out of a tin - and a baked potato with a chilli con carne filling. (they wouldn't need a chef to rustle that up) I was expecting Dinner! - Nope! Also, there was a horrible B.O. odour in the room, on arrival."
5365,Claire,2021-09-27,4.0,Good Good chouse It was quite cold by the time I got back to my table
5366,Nick,2021-09-26,4.0,"Perfect for airport travel Beautifully clean, comfortable beds and friendly staff Had to jump to get onto the toilet"
5367,June,2021-09-26,4.0,"Very good Room was excellent, staff very friendly Didn’t have breakfast as flight was really early. Dinner was disappointing but this could have been due to the current situation."
5368,Rebecca,2021-09-25,4.0,"Very good Restaurant open until 22.00, good food."
5369,Lesley,2021-09-25,4.0,"Lovely quiet modern hotel Room spacious, comfortable, clean, modern and quiet. Breakfast-time was relaxed with plentiful choice. Staff friendly and helpful. Parking readily available in hotel car park. My partner found the pillow too thin and unsupportive, and there weren't any more in the room. I would have liked to have seen a few more interesting items on the menu."
5370,Pamela,2021-09-24,4.0,A perfectly good place to stay. Perfectly placed for the airport. Crisp clean bedroom. Light breakfast available for an early get away I understand why the checking in & out process is virtually contact less but I miss the human touch.
5371,Vicki,2021-09-24,4.0,relaxing all service was good nothing
5372,Mark,2021-09-24,4.0,"Very good The location of the hotel is perfect if you arrive late at the airport (or if you have an early flight). The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The breakfast is very much ‘off the production line’, with the fruit out of tins. It is okay but nowhere near the best we have had at a hotel."
5373,Helena,2021-09-24,4.5,Superb Amazing location if you have an early flight. Super clean and comfortable.
5374,Angela,2021-09-24,4.5,"Very enjoyable stay after a holiday. As a vegetarian good choice cooked breakfast, good selection to eat and drink. Only thing was no extra pillows in room got in bed and pillows bit flat."
5375,Matthew,2021-09-23,4.5,"Highly recommended for early departures and late arrivals Always reliable hotel, great for late arrivals or early departures. The rooms are beautifully appointed and quiet, soundproofing must be good. The staff are friendly and helpful. My wife had to make a trip into Bristol in the morning (losing our spot in the long stay which doesn’t allow reentry) but the hotel were happy for her to park in the hotel car park when she got back, which was very much appreciated. There was a technical problem between the booking.com and Hilton systems which meant that we were initially overcharged for our room, but the front desk were very helpful in sorting it out and fully refunding the difference. It would be great to have some kind of rapid checkin for late flight arrivals as everyone arrives at once and is so tired."
5376,Anthony,2021-09-23,3.5,Good  Breakfast cold at 7am very poor
5377,Frances,2021-09-23,4.0,"Very good Comfy room, lovely breakfast, cleanliness and a great proximity to the Terminal in the airport. For some reason we only had one pillow each. Reception did not answer the phone on many occasions for me to request two more. Had to trudge down to Reception as they did not answer and ask for pillows. Reception was manned by two people who were ignoring the telephone. That was not good."
5378,Kawasakiqueen,2021-09-23,4.5,"Superb The selection and choice at breakfast was exceptional, something for everyone, The room was very clean, spacious, and comfortable, The staff on hand were very friendly and welcoming access to the hotel from the airport terminal isnt great with heavy suitcases due to the amount of stairs, and the acccess ramps taking you so far away"
5379,Carol,2021-09-23,4.5,Superb All the rest was OK Found it very difficult to get from hotel to airport as had to carry case up steps very hard for my age 78yrs on my own. Plus my daughter took me and it was £5 just to drop me off.
5380,Jan,2021-09-22,3.5,Good Clean quiet great location Early morning breakfast very basic - could have better choice pastries fruit etc

5382,Cheershouse,2021-09-22,4.5,"Fabulous for a quick stay at the airport Good standard clean and comfortable rooms Very limited menu, if you're staying more than one night it is difficult to find something different to eat on the second night"
5383,Nicola,2021-09-21,3.5,Good location and large room Way too expensive No breakfast has left at 03:45 and nothing offered instead (paid B&B rate) Had to pay for parking on the night of our stay System to order dinner was ridiculous Small evening meal menu
5384,Euan,2021-09-21,4.5,Ideal place to stay right at the airport. Fantastic location to airport. Decent food. Very clean room. Perfect for an overnight. I'd have liked to be able to get room service.

5394,Kevin,2021-09-17,4.5,Really hate surveys! Great welcome and attention Room was a little cramped ! Less furniture would give more room around the bed.
5395,Cilla,2021-09-16,3.5,Good Closeness to airport Pillows Poor choice of menu in restaurant
5396,Derek,2021-09-16,4.0,"The stay was fine and suited our purposes very well. Breakfast was and lunch. Staff were very helpful especially the day time reception staff, couldn't have asked for anything more."
5397,Jane,2021-09-16,4.0,Flying out early meant we needed to find something the night before and this was perfect. Everything was good. I had tried to use my Hilton Points but couldn’t get anything sorted. Nothing

5402,Sherrie,2021-09-14,3.5,Great for an early flight. The location was perfect and the hotel was very clean and the staff were lovely. Food on offer done on a canteen basis which I didn’t like. Limited menu.
5403,Francine,2021-09-13,3.5,"Pleasant The hotel was extremely well located for Bristol Airport. Very clean and modern but perhaps lacking a little soul but I think that might be due to the covid restrictions. The staff were helpful and charming but there was not many of them….overall a pleasant experience and I would recommend it to anyone travelling….it was not cheap but it was very clean and everything worked more or less Soulless atmosphere, air conditioning broke down during the night setting off a hideous alarm"
5404,Natalija,2021-09-13,4.5,"Very clean and peaceful 2 minutes walk from terminal. Lovely clean room with good use of space. Absolutely silent, no noise factor at all. I slept very well. I also thought the staff were good and the breakfast was generous- you can eat the buffet breakfast and take coffee and food away in a paper bag for later. The hotel was fairly quiet which is good as I hate having breakfast in busy dining rooms. I think the price is a little expensive compared to similar standard hotels but it is the only real airport hotel in Bristol."
5405,Linda,2021-09-13,4.5,Great Airport hotek As Airport hotels go this is 1 of the best Excellent breakfast with great choices and meal of the day super value Nothing

5410,Margaret,2021-09-09,4.5,Superb Near the airport
5411,Jon,2021-09-07,4.5,Really convenient but over priced. Exceptionally convenient for early morning flights and allowed us to arrive at our destination to feel fresh. I expected to hear lots of noise but we slept perfectly. Over priced!
5412,Teri,2021-09-07,4.0,"Overnight Airport Stay Excellent position with short walk to terminal. Room was clean, comfortable and great shower! Staff were very helpful and seamless process to book in and out. Evening meal/Burger was excellent. No outside area to enjoy a drink with tables and chairs just a smoking bench to front and rear. Breakfast was barely warm, no choice of eggs, only scrambled."
5413,Darren,2021-09-07,4.5,Superb Sofa bed rock hard. You can hurt yourself on all the exposed metal.
5414,Ben,2021-09-06,4.0,Lovely stop off The facilities were amazing for travellers who need a overnight stop off between flights. There is nothing we didn’t like about the property.

5416,Margaret,2021-09-05,3.5,Perfect for a one night stop over! Breakfast was just average! Location perfect after a late flight! More fresh fruit and berries for breakfast and scrambled egg that was yellow in colour not cream! and wasn’t sitting on a hot plate for hours!!! Fresh baked bread would have been nice!

5420,Dorothy,2021-09-03,3.5,Fine for the night and great for airport Just had continental take away which was fine. Room was said to be queen but bed a king? More towel rails needed! Bathroom needed more towels rails and two pillows would have been good.

5424,Chriscal18,2021-09-01,4.0,"Becoming our regular pre flight accommodation. Close to the airport Food a bit pricey , but expected for an airport hotel."
5425,Peter,2021-08-30,4.0,"Convenient but not wholly pleasant. Very convenient for the airport. I ticked the box for a quiet room on the top floor, but was told that only two floors were in use. I would swear that there was someone in the room above me and it was not particularly quiet."
5426,Helen,2021-08-30,4.0,"Very pleasant stay but disappointed about lack of breakfast. The location was perfect and so was the room, very comfortable bed. We didn't manage to have breakfast as it was not available early enough. Most disappointing. We were on a 6am flight, but so must a lot of other guests be as there are a lot of flights at that time, so it would be great to be able to get breakfast earlier."
5427,Nicola,2021-08-30,3.5,Good Near departures and parking Had to wait for room…. At £200 + I expected something amazing !
5428,Gerald,2021-08-29,4.5,"Excellent room, staff and breakfast Breakfast was excellent standard and choice. Room was of a high standard and bed was exceptionally comfortable. Staff very friendly, professional and very helpful. The time it took for reception to answer the phone. We had to chase our evening meal order ordered. We waited 40 minutes for a call to say it was ready for collection. Our order had been forgotten so we had to wait for it to be prepared. Staff were very apologetic. Food was good, worth waiting for!"
5429,Natasha,2021-08-29,4.0,"Exactly what you need Exactly what you need when your flight is at 6am. Right next to airport, early breakfast, comfy beds. Restaurant could be a bit more varied and better quality."
5430,Po,2021-08-29,4.0,We arrived at 10pm so only lukewarm water for our shower Breakfast included; close to airport bus A1

5435,Rosamond,2021-08-25,4.5,"I was happy with the facilities, very close to the airport. We did not have time to enjoy breakfast but picked up some porridge on the way to the flight."
5436,Boyd,2021-08-24,4.0,Good quality hotel Staff very friendly and extremely helpful Evening food was very limited in choice and in my opinion not the best quality. Not what you'd expect for this type of hotel
5437,Martyndurran,2021-08-23,3.5,"Needs must  Typical Hilton, no soul"
5438,Helen,2021-08-22,4.0,"Very good Very friendly staff, a really easy and quick check-in and check-out. Great breakfast! It would be nice to have 2 pillows per bed as a standard."
5439,Ben,2021-08-22,3.5,"Good The hotel was clean and modern, got a gym on sight and a bar also. And the rooms was clean and welcoming. The hotel is really nice, could recommend people to stay. The TV wasn't picking up any channels in my room when staying. It was a fair amount of money for my stay for 2 nights plus the £8 per night parking. Ideal for flying out, but when staying in the area, it was a lot of money. Also the selection menu for dinner was limited, not a lot to choose either."
5440,Sneddon-hinojosa,2021-08-22,4.0,"Excellent location, clean room, and overall good value for money. Hotel was very convenient for the airport, room was very clean, breakfast was extensive with plenty of choice. Room decor was a little sterile; would have been nice to have a couple of additional pillows."
5441,Amanda,2021-08-21,4.5,"Brilliant extra helpful staff went over and above Staff, location Just wish we’d known the kingdom stay carpark was so near and we could have just parked there and give straight to departures in the morning"
5442,Richard,2021-08-21,4.5,"Can't wait to return to this hotel. Location is good. Staff are welcoming and very friendly. Rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. I have stayed here before and look forward to returning. Absolutely nothing."
5443,William,2021-08-21,3.5,Good Used a few times before so location great along with facilities Spacious clean room Great after red eye flight Breakfast is average with varied food temperature from buffet and powdered scrambled egg Extortionate price due to pandemic supply and demand
5444,Hayley,2021-08-18,4.0,"Very good Great location as only a few minutes walk to the airport. The staff are very friendly, especially the check in staff. The breakfast started very early, which worked well for us with an early flight. Great selection too! I thought the hotel was quite expensive and the dinner menu was very limited, especially for vegetarians."
5445,Joey,2021-08-17,3.5,"Excellent location but no connecting room The location next to Bristol airport (but not physically linked to it) is brilliant in particular for the weary traveler on an early morning flight. Very clean, new, functional rooms. On check-in requested two connecting rooms and was offered two rooms in the same corridor - only to find that one was a connecting room with nobody yet checked-in on the other side (the covid seal on the other door was intact). Despite this well worth it."
5446,Catherine,2021-08-17,4.5,"Ireland eve I loved this hotel, the staff were lovely and the hotel itself was lovely and clean and comfy . The only thing I can fault with this hotel was the shower. I looked forward to the shower as again was lovely and clean. However, as soon as I stepped In the floor was so slippery I went straight on my back and bruised my arm and my back badly. For me the floor is way too slippery and I nearly fell over in it again."
5447,Darren,2021-08-17,4.0,"Super convenient. We always stay here when we have an early flight the next day. We have a couple of drinks in the bar before going to bed, which is nice, We always sleep well and it saves us getting up in the middle of the night if we were to travel to the airport on the same day. Bar staff could have been a bit more efficient, but its a minor gripe."
5448,Simon,2021-08-16,4.0,Very good Clean comfortable and quiet room. Very convenient for my purpose Although breakfast included it was of v low quality
5449,Robert,2021-08-16,4.0,Very good Staff were helpful and accommodation met expectations and was clean. No issues so perfect. Clean and tidy with helpful staff
5450,Mayumi,2021-08-16,4.0,"Cool interior design excellent hotel Room was clean. Bedding quality was high. Interior design in Hampton was excellent. Gym was very useful. Although I didn't use laptop safe, I think it is useful. Communal area was very clean and nicely colour coordinated. Shower tiles were very small. They are very nice in design wise when they are new. But as it gets older, grouting gets dirty easy. I wish we have fridge in room."
5451,Geeta,2021-08-15,4.0,"Good Cleanliness, smiley staff Evening cafe food was atrocious! Overpriced!"
5452,Nicola,2021-08-15,3.5,"Easy hasselt free stay. Quick check in, parking tickets dealt with quickly. Never enough milk for me in the room, bar menu minimal and not great food."
5453,Kate,2021-08-15,4.0,"Welcome rest stop minutes walk from the airport This was a quick convenience after a late night flight. Check in was fast and while the room was nothing special it was clean, comfortable and a welcome rest. We were in an accessible room which for those requiring supportive bathroom furniture, I would recommend these rooms as these are really well equipped."
5454,Sarah,2021-08-15,4.5,"Superb Breakfast- fantastic! Early check in- thank you! Helpful staff Bed was a bit hard for sleeping! Sorry, comfortable but a very firm mattress which my back didn’t like!"
5455,Julie,2021-08-14,4.0,Very good Clean and comfortable Close to terminal Reception very friendly and efficient Pizza not as good as previously Bar staff not so friendly
5456,Patricia,2021-08-13,4.0,Excellent but marred by the above. We were able to pick up a grab breakfast for a 7 a.m. flight. The room was good and we were comfortable. The food we had for dinner wasn’t brilliant. We got a fine for going into the car park at the airport the wrong way. We are pensioners and I had asked if we could park at the hotel if we paid in advance as we have disabilities. We got a fine for stopping at a line and it’s not fair.
5457,Teresa,2021-08-13,4.5,Superb Buffet breakfast was available from 4am - fantastic for those of us with crack of dawn flights. Doggy bags available for those with no time to sit down. Restaurant open for dinner until 10pm - simple food but good. Everything was great
5458,Eann,2021-08-13,4.5,Nice hotel Nice clean hotel in good location for airport. Room incredibly dark during the night. A very dim light would of been good in the bathroom.

5464,Sophie,2021-08-11,4.5,"Perfect for an airport hotel Very clean, excellent and very accommodating staff, comfortable and convenient for the airport. Highly recommend. No rooms have baths which makes it slightly inconvenient with little ones - not a dealbreaker though!"
5465,Sean,2021-08-11,3.5,Good LOCATION HAD TO BE IN THE AIRPORT AT 4.00AM BUT NO BREAKFAST PROVIDED
5466,Jose,2021-08-11,4.5,"Next to Airport, perfect for visiting Bristol and surroundings. Next to the airport, perfect for traveling around the area, excellent service. Rooms are very comfortable and breakfast is nice and abundant. Nothing to complain about but Be aware is 8 pounds extra per day for parking. Everything else was superb. If arriving late maybe worth not hiring a car the same day as the hotel is located meters away from the airport main entrance."
5467,John,2021-08-10,4.5,"Summer Holiday Clean, close to Airport, good food … Nothing to dislike"

5470,Sharon,2021-08-10,4.0,Very good Beds very comfortable. Quiet and clean hotel. Lively staff. Limited menu and mainly pub like food.
5471,Alison,2021-08-08,4.5,The best airport hotel Always stay here before an early flight if it’s available. Can’t beat the location and helpful staff. The rooms are ideal and comfortable. The holiday starts upon checking in. Food variety and quality has deteriorated since my last visit.
5472,Stephen,2021-08-07,3.5,"Business trip Nice comfortable rooms, close to the airport It's difficult to rate due to operating during covid. So overall it was the best experience that could be offered under the circumstances. Well done to all !"
5473,Ian,2021-08-07,4.5,"Great place to stay for an early flight. Location is great, very helpful staff and very clean and confortable. The reataurant menu is very small and the choice not brilliant. Needs to improve. The price is high considering hotels are supposed to be desperate for customers........This is Bristol not Heathrow!"

5477,Jacqueline,2021-08-04,4.5,"Excellent location for Airport. Location excellent for airport. Extremely Clean, plenty of hand gel and antibacterial wipes available. The rooms, beds, towels and bathrooms were really good standard. Lovely reception and restaurant staff. The breakfast selection was very good. The bar food wasn’t particularly good. Both burger and chips were bone dry and the chips cold. I think the burgers were microwaved to oblivion. Breakfast scrambled eggs were of the egg powder type, which always taste like water, not like eggs."
5478,Jeffrey,2021-08-01,4.5,surperb everything nothing
5479,Julia,2021-08-01,3.5,Wouldn’t recommend food Bed very comfortable Last time I stayed at the hotel the evening meal was basic but good. Last night had the chicken burger … not recommended. Just because there is a pandemic please don’t dumb down the food.
5480,Richard,2021-07-30,4.0,Convenient base for people needing to use the airport. Large comfortable rooms

5482,Ian,2021-07-29,4.5,"A good modern hotel in a very useful location. Excellent location. Good facilities. Well provided and comfortable bedroom. The breakfast is OK but a bit 'standard' in comparison with others in the same price range. However, satisfactory within the price. Most of the beer pumps were off."
5483,Elsbeth,2021-07-28,4.0,"Great location for the airport We stayed here the night before our flight and it was perfect walking distance to the terminal. We had dinner in the restaurant, very small menu but could be that they were short staffed or Covid related. Room was clean however the bin hadn’t been emptied from the last people staying there. Small menu choices and dirty bins."
5484,Michael,2021-07-28,4.0,Adequate Breakfast options good - takeaway Felt it was expensive for what I’d a simple one night stay with a very early start

5489,Keith,2021-07-24,4.0,As I stayed here before it meets my expectations My early flights to Gibraltar means I can never enjoy breakfast. The bathroom was a disability bathroom with a wet room which had a level that allowed water to leak onto the carpet at the entrance.
5490,Alice,2021-07-23,4.0,Very good Comfy and clean rooms - great for an early flight. Very helpful staff. Limited options in the restaurant.
5491,Helen,2021-07-23,4.5,"Excellent accommodation in a terrifically convenient place. Excellent hotel, well appointed, extremely clean. We had very good service from staff serving the food and from Reception staff. Well done to all. The menu was extremely limited and didn't allow any real choice. The food that was served was shockingly bad - the coating on the squid was mushy and uncooked; the macaroni cheese was full of flour that hadn't been cooked out, was pale, completely lacking in cheese and, to boot, cold. The 'special' was cannelloni and that was more of the same. The hotel was very let down by the food but that can't detract from the main function of the hotel which was the provision of excellent accommodation and comfort."
5492,Seamus,2021-07-22,4.5,Superb The staff are very helpful Nothing
5493,Raymond,2021-07-21,4.0,Very good Close to the airport. 4 am breakfast provided for early flight. Helpful staff. Quiet. Comfortable bed. Fairly ordinary food and drinks
5494,Valerie,2021-07-20,4.0,made a 0700 flight less tiring close to airport. easy for early morning flight. Good idea to have breakfast bags available to eat at the airport
5495,Tim,2021-07-20,4.0,Very good Newish airport hotel. All facilities you would expect. Very clean. Breakfast totally ok. We had a family room. The sleeping couch is very uncomfortable.

5497,Steven,2021-07-18,4.5,Very good I found the whole hotel to be welcoming and comfortable.
5498,Elayne,2021-07-18,3.5,Comfortable bedrooms and spotlessly clean Room and so close to airport Wanted a cooked breakfast but unfortunately our flight was before 7.00pm which is when a cooked breakfast would be served.

5500,Liz,2021-07-14,3.5,Good Clean and comfy.
5501,R,2021-07-12,4.0,"Good site and ideal for airport stay. Easy to find and very close to main terminal. Plenty of parking so able to unload cases easily and parking was free to resident. Staff very helpful and facilities clean and good service. Quiet with few guests due to pandemic. Limited evening meal menu, probably due to pandemic.Choice from about half a dozen items for main course and all fairly basic."
5502,Sarah,2021-07-10,4.0,Very good Handy for airport Breakfast was poor
5503,Gary,2021-07-10,4.5,PRE DEPARTURE STAY Staff very helpful Reasonable breakfast choice for early departure Limited food menu but understand this at present times

5505,Marta,2021-07-09,4.0,"Handy stay over Proximity to the airport always a bonus especially with an early flight. Staff always friendly and helpful The pillows provided - just 2 of them, were uncomfortable and we would have appreciated additional ones being available"
5506,Simon,2021-07-08,3.5,"Table service but not enough staff. Room was very comfortable and food (when it arrived) was good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Lasagne was tasty, and plenty of it. Pizza was well cooked. Service in the bar/dining area was very slow. Took over an hour to have two beers, two meals and two shorts. Staff were not very attentive. Tables weren’t cleared and drinks orders were taken and then took 15 minutes to arrive. They were absolutely lovely and friendly, but just not very quick. Three staff in the dining/reception area to check people in and look after ten people in the bar. I can do that on my own. Place is very over priced (£120+ for two people for bed and “breakfast”, which consisted of a bagged croissant, fruit, coffee, juice and fruit juice - but they have a captive market, have to recoup money from being shit down, and can ultimately charge what they want due to the location. I don’t mind paying the money for the convenience, but they need to make it worth me spending the money. For that money I would expect a decent breakfast to be available before 0600 for a start."
5507,Julie,2021-07-06,4.0,"Very good Great location, very clean. They need more vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. No cereals for breakfast."

5520,Julian,2021-06-27,3.5,"Short, utilitarian but nice stay. Limited dinner menu unappetising so ate locally Excellent and cleanly cooked breakfast ; Lauren was lovely and made our son waffles with chocolate sauce when she overheard him mention it. The car park fee was an unpleasant surprise and should have been clear; it will always cause problems even discounted."
5521,Kate,2021-06-27,4.5,Superb Clean and great rooms Not enough staff Breakfast was a nightmare
5522,Sudhi,2021-06-27,3.5,Good Manager was really good and very helpful Some of the staff was not very helpful. Restaurant menu was very limited
5523,Dorothy,2021-06-25,4.0,Perfectly located hotel with super staff 5 minutes from the airport. Incredibly clean. Very welcoming staff and comfortable rooms. Really good service in the Lounge/restaurant and a particularly great guy on reception who couldn’t have been more helpful. Continental Breakfast from 4am was really helpful. Could have done with maybe one healthier dish on the menu but wouldn’t stop me returning.
5524,Keith,2021-06-24,4.5,"easy hassle free stay ,close to airport proximity to airport, lovely homely hotel lobby, bedroom great size but decor maybe not as nice as lobby and communal areas...a little stark in comparison proximity to airport but good public transport link to city if so wished"

Consiidering the hotel is a few minutes walk from the airport it is very quiet. early flight and due to COVID take away continental breakfast bagged reasy to go.. Expected to be reduced evening menu and it was sorry to say not up to usual standard.
5527,Andrew,2021-06-15,4.0,Very good Warm welcome although the hotel appeared quite empty. All satisfactory
5528,David,2021-06-14,4.5,"Can think of visit being bettered. Self, not into much breakfast. Wife very much enjoyed, eat well. My wife has Dementia so this was the 'good bye' visit to friends of long standing. The condition can be difficult but the staff could not do enough to help. Lovely people. Nothing"
5529,Karen,2021-06-13,4.5,"Superb Lovely staff, exceptionally clean rooms and bathroom. And so easy to walk into the terminal at 4am!! Incredibly small menu but I guess that’s due to the times we’re living in. But we managed and the food was good - especially the Korean chicken burger. The only slight negative was the size of the duvet - too small for the bed. But we were only in the bed for 4 hours before our flight so wasn’t too bad 😂"
5530,Karen,2021-06-09,4.5,Superb The rooms were lovely. Shower especially excellent. My bfast wasnt as warm as I would have liked but still edible. I appreciate it was very busy.
5531,Alyn,2021-06-06,4.5,Excellent service and very clean. Felt very safe during these times. Location and value for money
5532,Christine,2021-06-05,4.0,You definitely pay for being close to the airport departures The airport is so close to departures which is fabulous. The staff were very helpful and helped us with our problem. We thought the room very basic for the price we paid for the room. You definitely pay for being right next to departures. Breakfast was included but as we had a 7 am flight got a bag with a few bits in. Not quite what we expected. Could do a better job of that.
5533,Royston,2021-06-03,4.5,Perfect Room was comfy and quiet.
5534,Sonali,2021-06-02,4.0,"Next to the airport- great location for odd hour flights and very clean rooms. We had an early morning flight and chose Hampton because it is literally 5 minutes walk away from the airport. Very comfortable location. Only downside was taxi to city center was rarely available and we had to wait for 30 minutes until we got ours. For early morning flight, the hotel had arranged takeaway breakfast including juice/coffee, croissant and a fruit. It could have been a bit better but i am not complaining as i am not much of an early morning breakfast person. We took a three person occupancy room. The main bed was clean and comfortable but the sofa cum bed for the third person was very uncomfortable. That can certainly be worked upon."
5535,Iestyn,2021-06-02,4.0,Ceidrych Gwesty 1af Walking distance to airport Staff extremely friendly and helpful Quiet rooms Good bed Fairly priced car park - not airport rates!
5536,Craig,2021-06-01,4.5,"Decent hotel for the money Breakfast was really good quality and the variety was excellent. The rooms was nice and clean. The bathroom was really good with shower gel and shampoo included. Parking should be free considering the price of the rooms. Evening menu was not very good and the food quality didn't match the prices you charged. You shouldn't have to wait in a long que to get your parking ticket validated at the reception desk, they should have a better system in place for customers who have already booked in."
5537,Keith,2021-05-31,4.0,"A good airport hotel Very welcoming (Jez), very clean and comfortable room, very convenient location. Dinner meal choice was burger/pizza. Would have preferred ""proper"" (i.e. not fast food) dinner. Breakfast was good, though."
5538,Donna,2021-05-31,3.5,"Good Close to the airport Food not great (cold) but they gave us free desert which made up for it, and not long been open so we have to understand that."

5541,Cheryl,2021-05-26,4.0,"Airport Hotel with a friendly vibe Room was well laid out and clean. Location excellent for airport. Staff very friendly and helpful. Due to current restrictions on holidays abroad, there were limited choices for food available at the hotel. It was however nicely done and the staff were excellent. I would suggest any allergies or food restrictions are advised in advance to ensure a choice would be made available. The hotel is perfect for flights out from Bristol Airport and parking at the multistorey. Overall, very good experience."
5542,Jacqueline,2021-05-22,3.5,Good Location and cleanliness. Friendly helpful staff. Room a bit chilly and I mentioned at checkout that 2 pillows would have been preferable.
5543,Linda,2021-05-21,4.5,Superb Very friendly and helpful staff. Having to pay car parking charges. They were discounted though.
5544,Lynda,2024-05-01,3.0,The staff were the best thing about this hotel. We liked the staff. Extremely helpful and friendly and valued the customer. The location was perfect for a short walk to departures. Breakfast should be optional in case it's not needed. Bathroom very cold. A towel rail would be good. Check bathroom linen as ours had a hole in it. Parking should be free. This is due to Bristol airport taking over the hotel car park so not the fault of the hotel but negotions could take place to rectify this. Beds were very hard.
5545,William,2024-04-30,5.0,Great for trips from airport Really handy for departures from airport. Access from car park is ramped and easy to get to hotel. Serving meals and drinks can be slow depending on number waiting.

Comfortable bedroom, good shower, TV worked well. Bar was well stocked, staff friendly and professional. Breakfast was amazing, one of the best I’ve had in an airport hotel! Reception didn’t take my card details on check in and I needed to add this later when getting a drink from the bar. One side of bed was quite close to wall despite wide room."
5549,Anonimouse,2024-04-30,2.0,"Disappointing Convenient, of course, and completely met my low expectations. Overpriced, as cost of breakfast included, even though we flew too early."

5556,Samantha,2024-04-28,5.0,Perfect for an overnight stay before early morning flight Perfect for an overnight stay before an early morning flight as the hotel is less than a 5 min walk from the airport. We were 2 adults and 2 teens and had 2 spacious connecting rooms which were quiet and we all had a very good night's sleep. Great that breakfast was available from 4am and the staff were nice and friendly. A bit pricey for a family of 4 for 1 night but we felt it was money well spent for the convenience.
5557,Richard,2024-04-27,5.0,"Exceptional The bathroom and bed are very satisfactory. The room is biggest and lied on bed then sleep fast. I don’t like staff has lots of write each other, it’s really late, we need sleep early. 🤨"

5560,Lisa,2024-04-22,2.5,Great location but rip off parking costs Great location and lovely staff but cost £60 for 1 night to park my car so ruined the stay as that's just a rip off Room OK but a bit small with 2 beds in it

5562,Claire,2024-04-21,5.0,"A Little Pricey But Worth it for the Convenience The location was superb - literally a few steps from the terminal. I was up at 4am, eating breakfast at 4.15pm and on the plane and flying by 6am as I had no luggage to check in. The room was sparkling and spacious too. Loved the 4am breakfast option and flight details on departure boards in the hotel. It was a bit pricey, but I appreciate I was paying for the absolute convenience of it all."

5564,Nicholas,2024-04-20,2.0,"The dinner experience was disappointing, similar to a canteen. And overpriced for v. early departure The bed and shower After a 5 hour drive from Cornwall, due to accident on the motorway, we were not aware that the car park was not owned by the hotel and was not informed by reception that we needed to have our car park ticket validated. To return our hire car, and exit the car park, I had to pay £12 for 26 minutes. I find this unacceptable."

Being given a disabled access room without asking if that was OK with us. Very crowded, little food available, long delay, and wrong meal arrived! Food poor quality and poor value for money. The room was hot, hard to control temperature and no natural ventilation ie openable window."

The lobby was dirty. The staff were not welcoming or friendly. There was a stain on my bedding and the room was cold. The breakfast was a buffet and no proper full on 'English'. Just felt that the H by H are totally exploiting the location of the hotel in relation to the airport. You expect to pay more, but not at the expense of service, quality or cleanliness. Next time I will be trying the small privately run hotel less than 5 minutes away."

5614,Matt,2024-03-18,5.0,Very good. Great friendly staff and comfortable room. Local to the airport. So very convenient. Breakfast tables don’t feel clean. They are slightly sticky and it is one small thing that lets down the hotel.
5615,Shane,2024-03-18,5.0,Highly recommend Great comfortable hotel. Stones throw from departures. Staff were amazing and even recommended places to go in paris where we were going to visit after outlr stay
5616,Christine,2024-03-17,5.0,Use the hotel for all our early Bristol flight and no reason not to keep doing so. A quick breakfast but perfect for an early flight. closeness to airport is a bonus unfortunately on this occasion the walkway was closed. Evening meal - noodles - good.
5617,Rosaleen,2024-03-16,2.0,Poor value Bright and clean Food dreadful- microwaved cheap stuff Basic amenities such Netflix not available.
5618,Willow,2024-03-15,3.0,"Mixed feelings Comfortable beds, good aircon, good bedside reading lights, pleasant staff, excellent location Pathetic breakfast! Little choice of bread, no Marmite, most yogurt full of sugar, poor quality bacon and sausage. Disappointing given the cost of the room and the Hilton name. Only good things were the coffee and helpful staff (I needed gluten-free bread). General lighting in the room very poor - no central light. No shaving mirror Very expensive but it's the only onsite hotel so they can charge whatever they want"
5619,Vicki,2024-03-14,5.0,"Brilliant! Its proximity to Bristol airport, the reception staff, the cleanliness of the room, the bed was extremely comfortable, the room was quiet. We were very impressed & will definitely stay again."

5623,Lynda,2024-03-06,5.0,"Exceptional So impressed with this airport hotel. Immaculate, comfortable, amazing selection at breakfast. Friendly staff. Great value for money. The long walk at 2am in the freezing cold due to the works being carried out but that's not your fault."
5624,Tony,2024-03-05,5.0,"Exceptional Perfect convenient location literally outside the terminal for early flight departures or late arrivals. Inevitably a bit faceless as a transit hotel with little staff engagement, but does exactly what it says on the tin!"
5625,Manilito,2024-03-04,5.0,"Late night stopover Room was great, very comfy bed, pillows. Bathroom clean and well appointed Nothing"
5626,John,2024-03-04,3.0,"A very mixed experience. Good, but not cheap hotel who failed to deliver on this occasion. After a serious problem the night staff led by Gill did their best to resolve it. While our sign in was unwelcoming, when Gill took over a few minutes later and dealt with my complaint, she was excellent and ensured that next morning we would have transport to collect our car. Great service, especially when compared to my comments below. Poor communication. Through no fault of the hotel the footpath was closed which meant a 10 minute walk with two large cases, one of which had no wheels so a struggle for two aged 78. When we raised this at the hotel we received a totally unhelpful response at the hotel check in by a rather curt man on the desk. It appears that we should have received a message by text to say if we needed help then we could get it and how. No message ever came and the text that did only explained the path closure and the long walking route. There was supposed also to be a notice at the arrivals doorway, but nothing evident at 10.30 at night."
5627,Derek,2024-03-04,5.0,Exceptional Excellent breakfast Nothing
5628,Angela,2024-03-03,5.0,Exceptional Location. Buffet breakfast. Comfy beds. Car parking prices are simply extortionate
5629,Anthony,2024-03-03,3.0,"Room location spoilt it location Hi On booking we stipulated a room near the lift,this was on the booking form as my wife needs assistance mobility wise.We were given room 371 which is the furthest you can get from the lift. As it was only one night we put up with it. Very poor."
5630,Andrew,2024-03-03,5.0,"Very impressive. A well designed hotel with travel in mind and the staff filled the space well! This hotel has looked carefully at the needs of travellers needing to make a quick getaway. The design of the rooms - and especially the bathroom - was exceptional . No bigger than most airport hotel rooms, it made excellent use of space. From the sliding bathroom door that 'closed'the wardrobe to the simply but thoughtfuly designed desk, bedside tables, multiple power points and superbly positioned shower controls and soap/shampoo this room had been carefully designed with the traveller in mind. No space wasted. Everything provided - even a safe. A+ facilities. The front desk and bar staff also worked as a team in a well-designed lobby and cafe. Superb. At first I did not like the fact that we couldn't book the room without breakfast - but - the way that they had set up the buffet breakfast by the airport exit door was again so you could grab a quick bite en route. Again - very thoughtful layout and design."
5631,Madeline,2024-03-03,5.0,"Exceptional My bedroom was really good. The room was clean, the bathroom /shower was excellent. The breakfast the following morning was very good plenty of different choices to have.. All in all a pleasant stay. I had an issue with my booking when I arrived.. The gentleman could not find my booking. I told him my name but continued to say he could not find it! I had to show him an email from my booking. He said my name was too long and the system did not show my surname. I felt quite stressed after having my journey to the airport. After much discussion it was sorted out."

5635,Leon,2024-02-27,3.0,Clean and comfortable but lacks any buzz. The location is perfect for flights out of Bristol. You can be in the airport in 2-3 minutes walk. The restaurant and bar offering are poor and overpriced for standard on offer.
5636,Janice,2024-02-26,5.0,Very impressed with hotel and staff super comfortable room. very quiet and had a very reasonably priced meal in the evening. Staff very friendly and welcoming. Had good nights sleep and very good breakfast before travelling on. Short walk across to the airport terminal probably bit more choice for vegetarians on the evening menu
5637,Andrew,2024-02-25,1.5,"Disappointed Location Noisy and overpriced, food wasn’t great either"
5638,Angela,2024-02-24,3.0,"Ok for sleep and ease for flight Next to the airport and comfy bed Flat Prosecco- poured by grumpy bar lady even after being asked not to use the dregs of a bottle continued to mix new bottle to try and fizz it up- had to ask another lady to change it, not cheap. Plus limited food choice in the restaurant."

5641,John,2024-02-23,2.5,"Good in parts Position, Breakfast, subsequent bus ride to silver car park. My pre stay email requesting sheets and blankets if possible was quickly acknowledged . On arrival told not available and accepted extra sheets, and told to ring 0 and ask for them. On doing this told blankets were available and would arrive. Later call to our room denied their availability, In a somewhat fraught manner. Perhaps a better outcome could have been achieved by indicating that my request was not possible. The other problem was dragging suitcases from the airport to the hotel when a long detour. Best wishes John Friend (A fit 87 yr old!)"

Staff not helpful in helping to navigate pavement closures Door was knocked by cleaning staff at 9am - when I mentioned to reception was told it was to see if we wanted room service or had checked out - not ideal for late flights in with small children, also made my child anxious"

5645,Karl,2024-02-20,5.0,"Exceptional Was a very nice stay, clean comfortable and inviting The only small grumble was there seemed to be a lack of correct glassware in the bar, was disappointing to be served lager in a different branded glass, and the customer next to me was also disappointed at a lack of gin balloon glasses and having to have a G&T in a wine glass."
5646,Grace,2024-02-19,5.0,Exceptional Lovely staff and we were able to have a meal when we arrived. Nothing
5647,Short,2024-02-19,5.0,Lovely relaxing time thank you. The breakfast was great very comfortable and very relaxing staff were excellent. One thing I missed was a fried egg with breakfast.
5648,Margaret,2024-02-19,0.5,"Awful, disorganised and chaotic.  The fact we had to walk in the dark to the terminal al snd the signposting was dreadful. I got lost twice, had to walk in the road, which is a health and safety issue. A simple shuttle bus service should have been organised."

5662,Ashleigh,2024-02-12,1.5,"Extortionate and disappointing Absolutely shocked and disgusted at the cost of parking. £45 for 10 hours. Apparently 'discounted' from £60. After already paying £150 for one night, and then paying £52 to park for 4 days at Bristol airport, this was just appalling. Will never return at that rate.

5663,Peter,2024-02-12,3.0,"Pleasant Hot breakfast served too late for our fligt We arrived the night before our flight. Parked in the Silver Zone car park, so had a shuttle bus to the airport, and then had to walk to the hotel the long way around in torrential rain as the tunnel was shut, so we and many others were soaked to the skin by the time we got to the hotel,"
5664,Nancy,2024-02-12,5.0,"Met all my needs and beyond . Very convenient to airport, breakfast started nice and early, exceptionally clean. Comfortable bed Would’ve liked decaf coffee in room please."

5666,Beckie,2024-02-11,5.0,Exceptional It was super close to the airport. I had an early flight and it was super easy to get up and walk to the terminal (under 5mis). The breakfast was included and it was open from 4am so you could get something to eat even if you had a really early flight. Nothing.

5669,Kathryn,2024-02-10,5.0,Great hotel with lovely staff. Clean and comfy. Lovely staff. Location couldn't be better Price of bar food was excessive. Two glasses of wine and two very small plates of pasta for £40. Was still starving after I'd eaten and had to go to M and S.
5670,Craig,2024-02-10,1.5,Not fantastic Location was very good Even with the walkway closed due to maintenance Signage for the closure could be better thou Bed was very uncomfortable Room very cold And like I said above the Signage could of been better or alternative walkways/transport could of been provided Wasn't offered alternative options due to early flight we missed breakfast Carpet wasnt clean lots of little bits/fluff
5671,Deborah,2024-02-10,5.0,Nice hotel as close as you will get to the airport This is across the road from the airport breakfast and rooms were lovely and staff helpful however we didn’t know we could arrange assistance even though they knew we had a disabled person with us they never told us. I booked a disabled room and told them I had a 94 years old with me! So when we booked it said free parking by the time when we went they had started charging £45!! We weren’t told and after I complained they wavered it.
5672,Peter,2024-02-09,0.5,"We want to sue you for screwing up our holiday and dismiss your incapable mangers We were advised that that there is a short connection between the Hamilton and airport 2 minutes by walk way. We arrived were told the connection was closed. This we were told we would have we would have to walk around the long side of the hotel. We were flying to Cape Verde and so had no wet weather gear. The walk is steep. I have declared Medical Conditions: Hypertension, Cholesterol levels, Angina Coronary Angioplasty, Rheumatoid Arthritis. We asked manager for assistance he said no. I was exhausted when I reached the airport soaked as the rain was extreme. On the return journey I telephoned your hotel from Arrivals at Bristol Airport. The manager informed me the situation had not changed we would have to walk the long way round but I said it is bucketing down with rain. We arrived soaked manager said it was not their responsibility. Under Freedom of Information how many other complaints have been made between 29-01-24 and 6-02-24 We want to sue you for this. You should have provided a mini bus service to the airport. You totally screwed up our holiday. Under freedom of information act I want to to know how many complaints you received 29-01-24 to 6-02-24"
5673,David,2024-02-08,0.5,Bad  The closure of the normal pedestrian route is wholly unacceptable when the alternative is a long detour. Blithely expecting your customers to haul luggage in the wind and rain beside a busy road at night is very bad for any hotel but for one that sells itself on convenience it is utterly unacceptable. You should have insisted to the contractor that a reasonable diversion was in place before proceeding with cutting off the normal route. If that was not possible you should have clearly forewarned your customers so that they could make alternative arrangements.
5674,Penelope,2024-02-08,2.5,"Only stayed as no better option Room quiet and comfortable convenient to airport Awful food choice, people queuing to order drinks and food, no waitress service. We went to M&S in airport to buy better quality fresh food."
5675,Jessica,2024-02-08,2.5,"Okay. Lovely and Clean. As we didn't arrive till early hours in the morning, we were able to extend the room departure till 2:00pm until our car arrived to collect us, free of charge, I just had to sign up to the Hilton honours. Arrived off the plane, and had to drag our suitcases in the pouring rain to the hotel, it says a minute walk from the airport but this was misleading as my daughter, friend and I walked for about 5-8 mins to get to the hotel, (maybe a car to collect would of been okay) For the price of the room, £180, the bed sofa was really hard. Breakfast you had to serve yourself, tea & coffee was through a machine, the breakfast was okay but no fried eggs, only scrambled and boiled??? I am not a snob by all means but 180 for a room, service could of been better. After a long flight, hardly any sleep maybe being served breakfast would suffice."
5676,Pilotmitch,2024-02-08,2.0,"Disappointing The location was good, although the walkway was closed, which was not advised on booking which meet awful walk around in the rain and 40mph winds.

5677,Kirsty,2024-02-07,3.0,"Staff were amazing. Room and facilities not so It was close to the airport. I don’t believe it was worth the price we paid for it, the room smelt damp."

5679,Sarah,2024-02-07,5.0,Good. Really clean hotel room and had 24hr reception. Food was good ( not alot of choice) but what I had was very good. Bit expensive and works to existing footpath meant a long walk around the road to the entrance with heavy luggage.
5680,Sandra,2024-02-07,3.0,"Convenient, friendly but expensive for the level of comfort you get Great location for airport and staff super friendly and breakfast plentiful Bed quite hard and rubbish pillows - the kind that look plump but squash down flat when you sleep on them (so one is too thin but two is too high)! There is a lot of construction going on at the airport so the pedestrian access between parking, hotel and airport is a bit all over the place at the moment"

5683,Mike,2024-02-05,3.0,"Pleasant That it is close to the airport Access was poor due to building works and badly signed.The bedroom was good but heating poor. The facilities provided for the lounge,bar and restaurant were very minimal which also describes the menu."

5694,Gillian,2024-01-28,1.5,Put up with it as the only hotel in the airport Close to airport Rooms freezing and so was public areas. Food depressingly poor and expensive
5695,Ann,2024-01-28,1.5,Disappointing stay. Location The 5 minute walk through the tunnel to the hotel became a 12 minute struggle with large suitcase and hand luggage because of poor signage diverting foot passengers due to tunnel closure. No prior warning and no explanation. Lighting in the hotel was not working between lifts and first floor nearest the airport. I reported it 3 times before it was repaired. What should have been easy became a real struggle. NOT IMPRESSED

Spacious and comfortable room, very close to terminal On checking in, the key card I was given initially for my room didn’t work and had to be replaced. Despite me turning the heating up in the room, it remained very cold. I eventually discovered when I phoned room service that the heating for my room had been turned off centrally, not impressed! Given it was a cold January evening, the heating should have been turned on automatically as soon as the room was allocated to a guest."

When asked why that was and why we were not told there was no drop off point we were told that you were allowed 1 hour free parking. When you werent looking for parking why would you look to see parking charges. Absolute rip off. Won't stay there again."

5730,Timothy,2024-01-11,2.5,Nice hotel. people suck!  The staff wouldn't validate my car parking ticket when i returned to my car as promised to me by the ginger guy on the desk. Therefore the car park reduced rate was not applied.
5731,Dr,2024-01-10,1.5,"Below average Overall experience was poor Rooms were noisy, cramped and poorly ventilated"
5732,Lulu,2024-01-10,5.0,"Very nice short stay. Convenient and easy to work everything out. Staff were helpful and had a smile to greet and help. Ahh the only thing was the toilet roll didn’t have much in it. Thought that was counting the pennies a bit too far! That said, did that really matter in the grand scheme of things, there was a new roll there anyway!"
5733,Jon,2024-01-10,5.0,Great location for transiting stays Directly outside the arrivals terminal. Age assist access to room and bathroom perfect for my aging father. Very comfortable stay. Car parking access very bad even for collecting people from this hotel.
5734,Louise,2024-01-09,5.0,"Very easy and convenient. Will be back. Loved the quite rooms, the location and the convenience of it all. The beds were immaculately clean and very comfy too. We were very grateful for the adjoining rooms. The breakfast was a bit sparce for the early flight."

5746,Julie,2024-01-04,5.0,Very good We have stayed a few times and it takes all the pressure away trying to get to the airport. You feel so flaxed before travelling.
5747,Lars,2024-01-01,5.0,"good value for money, confortable The breakfast was great and started so early , the location was amazing andthe room was all that it needed to be, perfect for overnight stays before travelling on to your destionation There wasn't anything that I didn't like. it met all of my expectations for an overnight stay at the airport"
5748,Jagerplymouth,2024-01-01,5.0,"This hotel takes away some of the ""hassle"" of flying. Location to airport terminal and coach stop ideal. Excellent reception staff on both occasions stayed either side of holiday. Cheerful comfy room, good sized bathroom with plenty of shampoo, conditioner etc. Good breakfasts, both continental and full English. Evening meal proportions good with fair choice of dishes, pizza option especially so! For a hotel of this standard I would have expected a toilet brush in the bath/wc room."
5749,Matthew,2024-01-01,3.0,Pleasant The hotel and staff were lovely. Being charged £45 for a night parking.

5755,L,2023-12-29,2.5,"Check parking charge before you book! Clean, comfortable beds. Bristol airport decided to charge £60 for parking a car in the hotel car park for 24 hours. We had no notification of this change!!!"
5756,Lee,2023-12-29,1.5,"Expensive hotel, small rooms, great location The location is great. It is the only on airport hotel so nothing else to compare it with. The fact I had 2 rooms booked apparently. They were going to look into it as I had prepaid in full for 1 family room. The room wasn’t ready when we arrived, after check in time. Then when it was the additional sofa bed wasn’t made up. It felt like guests were an inconvenience to hotel staff. It is not the typical Hilton experience. There is a sense of arrogance in that it is the only on airport hotel so they don’t really care what you think of it."
5757,Aled,2023-12-28,1.0,Poor value for money and over priced It is adjoining the airport so is within walking distance. At £143 the room is small and I expect more that a camp bed for an 11 year old. Considering Premier Inn room 2.3 miles away is as £43 and included a family room with breakfast.
5758,Stephanie,2023-12-28,5.0,Great airport hotel. Great clean modern hotel. Quiet despite being on the doorstep of a busy airport. An ideal place to stay when flying from Bristol. Breakfast starts at 4am which is great. I only had time for a hot drink and a great looking fruit salad. However the pineapple and melon were so tough that they were inedible. The only edible part was the watermelon. Disappointing.
5759,Antti,2023-12-27,3.0,Not a Hilton Decent room. Some friendly staff. Rather poor and expensive food provision on-site.

I would say for ♿ people ,the walk is a little too far from airport to front of hotel"

5764,Alison,2023-12-24,5.0,Great airport hotel. The breakfast was good. The bed was perfect.. The atmosphere in general was peaceful and quiet. Not enough milk in the room for coffee & tea. No bottled water in the room..
5765,Sian,2023-12-23,5.0,"The best hotel if you’re flying from Bristol It was a perfect location so close to terminal , amazing parking too x How ASD disabled friendly staff were , the staff Laura etc went above and beyond x"
5766,Terence,2023-12-23,3.0,"No choice at Bristol Airport. Room was comfortable and clean and heating adequate and responsive. Bed was also comfortable and relatively firm. Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful as we're the young people delivering food to table, but no table service as such. Once again, the 'so called' restaurant was extremely disappointing with cold air blowing down on several uncomfortable seating positions (we moved twice!). This is probably the least comfortable pr intimate 'restaurant' I have ever patronised at any time, anywhere in my eighty years and would not have looked out of place in any motorway transport cafe. Very little choice of menu and I suspect nothing was cooked to order but rather reheated in microwave as required. Food portions were very small and quality just about acceptable. Meals and drinks had to be ordered at the bar with completely extortionate prices charged for drinks (Guiness @ £4.00 / half pt., Draught bitter @ £5.70 /pt.)"
5767,Sharma-burford,2023-12-22,5.0,"I was greeted by a lovely lady and immediately felt comfortable as I was travelling alone, my room was spacious and clea Very welcoming and clean Nothing it was all amazing"
5768,Bown,2023-12-21,5.0,Relaxing night before a early morning travel Lovely evening meal value for money bed and comfy and the room was very clean Had to pay to be dropped off by my son outside the hotel he was there not even 5 minutes and had to pay £5 to get out
5769,Julie,2023-12-20,5.0,"Great stay My daughter with special needs became ill during our stay, l can’t thank Chris a member of the Hilton team enough, he was so very kind and supportive and was such a help supporting my daughter during her sickness.

5773,Mary,2023-12-18,5.0,"A very pleasant hotel, well located and with easy access to Terminals. Closeness to the airport, so extremely convenient, very well presented and very clean throughout. Good choice of food both breakfast and evening and reasonably priced plus a well stocked bar, offering a great selection of drinks to suit everyone and the staff extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. Think it's a bit pricey overall to stay here but there is nothing I would change in the hotel or rooms."

Every member of staff made me feel welcome. Special thanks to Sema, who checked me in. Credit is due to housekeeping - every surface was immaculate. The shower basin was too low, the shower water flooded onto the floor."
5781,Sioned,2023-12-12,0.5,Bad Great location Poor customer service. I was charged twice for the stay and told that my card had been “rejected”. So I was charged when I got there and through booking.com. It wasn’t dealt with well.

5783,Janet,2023-12-10,2.5,"Quiet night pre-flight disrupted by fire alarm going off at 1 am!!! A short walk from the Departure Hall at Bristol Airport, Ideal for a pre or post flight stopover. Comfortable and clean room and friendly staff. Being woken at 1 am by the fire alarm going off and having to evacuate the hotel, and wait outside in the cold with all the other guests for more than half an hour until the fire brigade had been and verified that the building was safe to re-enter. Someone had apparently been smoking in their room - it is a non-smoking hotel - which had set off the alarm system. Not a pleasant experience - but at least it wasn't raining outside!!!"

5789,Andrew,2023-12-08,2.5,"Average The pizza was really good and the full English the next day was tasty. There were a lot of choices for breakfast. And the fact it’s right next to the airport is great! Really liked the shower also. It was fairly pricey for the food and drinks but that was expected. Unfortunately the one thing that affected the stay was the sleep, the bed was really uncomfortable and my partner and myself struggled to get a good sleep. It was a shame because everything else was great!"
5790,Kirsty,2023-12-08,5.0,"Exceptional All of the staff were so friendly, the hotel is nice and clean and new, and so close to the airport it’s so handy!"

The hotel was beautiful. Christmas decorations were beautiful. Just loved the hotel. Breakfast started at 4 am which was brilliant as we could have food before our flight at 6.30am. Will definitely be staying there again with my family. Nothing.

My husband has mobility issues and the reason for staying at the airport hotel was to make the journey easier. Room was also not well laid out; a double bed was so close to the wall that it was impossible to get in and out of bed,"
5802,Lewis,2023-11-21,5.0,"spot on, close to airport, great hotel Close to airport, clean, spacious rooms, good food and drink downstairs, especially the pizza which was excellent, would most certainly stay here again the next time we fly from Bristol airport.

5806,Krittika,2023-11-20,5.0,Exceptional I loved my stay. Hopefully would book back again on my next trip to Bristol Breakfast was served early at 4 a m but consisted of mostly sweet and cold foods. I was hoping to grab a warm meal before my flight which was at 8 but hot meals were served only after 6am
5807,Christine,2023-11-19,5.0,Perfect airport hotel Simple enough hotel but very comfortable room and most helpful staff. They arranged special transport to the terminal for me because my leg was in a splint. Restaurant is cafeteria style but very efficient.

5811,Janet,2023-11-17,5.0,Convenient and comfortably for a short stay Great hotel for departing Bristol Airport or to stay and regroup when arriving back late at night. Comfy rooms. Food is a bit basic but it works OK as only there for 1 night.
5812,Russell,2023-11-17,5.0,Chose this hotel purely for the location as we had a early morning flight Nothing to much trouble for the staff. The bar staff were fantastic The price of the hotel bar is very excessive.

I liked the fact that the hotel was close to the airport, and the staff were friendly and helpful, room was of a good size, bed very comfy, abd clean shower a good size.

5829,Paul,2023-11-10,5.0,Exceptional On line The building work on the walk to terminal
5830,Clare,2023-11-09,5.0,Excellent for the night before an early flight. Close to terminal. Very pleasant staff. Great breakfast. Comfortable beds and very quiet. In the morning light and having found it the night before it was a three minute walk to the terminal. Works on airport grounds made finding it from the terminal in the dark(after twilight baggage drop) a little challenging but it was signposted and we got there without too much of a detour. It was a little expensive (quite a bit more so than the Premier at Gatwick North) as was parking which might make me reconsider Bristol as a choice as we are equidistant from both.
5831,Jennifer,2023-11-08,2.5,Needs must next time I’ll drive Close to airport The food was awful.. no effort made because customers have no choice

5838,Julia,2023-11-03,3.0,"Average hotel and expensive for what it offered. Lousy access route Efficient check in. Clean, comfortable room Booked specifically for location, this was negated by the VERY poor arrangements associated with the airport works. A ten minute walk through pouring rain was definitely not what we hoped for or expected. We paid for a convenience that was just not there. Maybe a senior manager should walk the route from the airport terminal, with a suitcase, at night in the rain and see if they think the arrangement is acceptable!!! Overall result means expensive one night stay without the expected convenience"
5839,John,2023-11-01,5.0,"The hotel was perfect for what we wanted after a long flight late at night. Adjacent to the airport. Breakfast was excellent. Staff, checking in and checking out were very helpful and friendly. All the building work which made a terrible trek to reach building."

5847,Reeve,2023-10-26,2.5,"Good clean hotel, ruined by an expensive car park. Easy to reach from the airport, large comfortable rooms cleaned to a good standard. Car parking is far too expensive, even with the discount from the hotel. Total rip off."

5850,Lee,2023-10-23,1.0,"Not our Best Experience Location is ideal for flying from Bristol Airport and one member of staff who could apologise enough for or issues we experienced whilst we were there The way we were treated when questioned over payment, which had been made through Booking.com earlier that day , in front of an ever increasing queue of people waiting to check in. I showed proof of payment via my banking app and the confirmation email I received from Booking.com . After what seemed to take ages and more people joining the queue, she eventually went and got her manager to assist with trying to find our payment. After her seemingly checking numerous monitors and with lots of clicking and me offering to show proof again , we were told that it sometimes it happens when payment made via Booking.com that both parties fail to communicate with each other. Luckily, another position was opened, and the queue subsided whilst she was still checking things and we were eventually getting our key. There was no real apology, and the manager did say she would contact Booking.com and confirm that payment had been made. On checking out the following morning, we were then questioned again for payment, to which I said this should have been sorted the pervious night and I also showed proof of email and payment again to the staff on the desk , which was then accepted. We always book the hotel on site when flying from Bristol even if we are travelling on a later flight the following day, so we can start our holiday as relaxed as possible, but we really didn't feel relaxed this time."
5851,Natasha,2023-10-23,5.0,"We will be back!! Perfect location for meeting up with other family members and catching a flight the next day. Rooms were lovely and clean, beds comfortable and facilities were top notch!! Booked again for another night very soon. Forgot to buy toothpaste so begrudgingly had to pay £2.99 for the worlds smallest tube of toothpaste and toothbrush, as it was the Hilton,something like that should be complimentary."

5853,Russ,2023-10-22,2.0,"Disappointing  Because of building work, the route to the airport was tortuous for someone who needed a wheelchair. There was no warning of this. Our room had an unpleasant smell. The reception/ bar area was stark, unwelcoming and over priced, with a mediocre food menu."

5861,Betsylita,2023-10-19,5.0,"Great place to stay when you have an early flight. No complaints at all. I had an early flight the next day so decided to stay at the Hampton. This is a great hotel - yes, somewhat expensive at about $200, but worth it for the convenience and the amenities. Easy dining experience (order at bar and food delivered to table). Lots of sitting areas. The room was excellent, spacious, comfortable, quiet, good quality all around. Probably a 10 minute walk to the airport, especially as at the time I stayed (early October) there was a lot of construction requiring a circuitous path to the terminal. Nothing"

5869,Anne,2023-10-18,2.5,"Rather soul-less place. Does what it says on the tin, everything there for breakfast. Room was clean and the tea/coffee facilities good. Shower and hair products in bathroom good, too. Our biggest bugbear. The floor of the shower was so slippery. It was highly dangerous and needs sorting before someone really hurts themselves, if they haven't already. Whatever products are being used to clean the shower floor need looking into."

Thank you Perhaps a quicker route from the airport to the hotel while the road works are being done? Maybe it just wasn’t possible because of the work that’s being done. My mum is 90, still walks unaided but we found it just a little frustrating that we had to go in one direction then back again."

Staff excellent during fire alarm giving out emergency blankets and ensuring no panic. Proximity to airport. Fire alarm at midnight meant an hour in the car park waiting for three fire engines. This wasn’t the hotel’s fault but it wrecked my stay and I had no sleep afterwards because I had to get up at 3am for my flight. I also didn’t like my taxi having to pay £5 just to drop me off at the entrance."

I am gluten free (NOT Celiac) and aside from salad with things missing and tomato soup which is too acidic, there was nothing for me to eat, I could have done without the fire alarm just after midnight. An hour or so in the breezy parking lot with everyone, dressed only my pajamas was interesting but very cold entertainment despite everyone being considerate and helpful. I stupidly left everything in my room, including my coat. They eventually brought us blankets. It was worse for the parents with kids. It's always important that the whole hotel got checked out by firemen but then I had to get up before 4 am to catch my flight."

Fire alarm went off at 11.45 pm Tuesday 20th. Wd waited outside for over an hour. Luckily it wasn't raining. This disturbed our sleep as we had to be up at 3.30. The whole point of staying at the hotel is to get some sleep before our early start. Does the hotel provide a room only facility.?

There was an incident with the fire alarm going off at around midnight and the staff were all great, remained calm and kept everyone in the carpark warm with blankets while the fire department cleared the building. The fire alarm went off at around midnight, which no one could help. But given we had to be up at 6am for a 9 hour flight the following morning. This meant we were extremely tired as we weren't able to re enter the building until around 1 am. Also our kettle didn't work, we only discovered this the following morning so had to go to the breakfast area to get a coffee which we hadn't intended on doing."

On arrival at approx midnight I was told by the receptionist did I want the bad or the good news. They no longer had the room I had previously booked and paid for but had a queen bed and sofa bed. The sofa bed mattress was approx 1.5 inches thick and you could feel all the springs. At that time of night following flight back there was no choice. Neither of us got hardly any sleep.

5976,Gowercoast,2023-09-03,2.0,"Stay if you have a 6am flight and have children to get organised. Put car in Silver Zone I have stayed many times. Soundproofing is excellent and always found the rooms Clean and well appointed The location is excellent and the staff are always pleasant, polite and willing to help if they can. Expensive to stay now despite booking months in advance. No longer good value..The Food is very hit and miss. The Breakfast is cheap end quality and if you have an early flight you dont get the complete works only continental, which is Okay .The car park is expensive. The beds are hard, which is fine if you dont have any skeletal issues eg arthritis ..The pillows aren't much better. so I always take my own. As I left the car park to take the car to the Silver zone the night before. I stopped short of the road but just after the exit barrier, to reset SAT NAV. That cost me £60 as security accused me of illegally stopping ..These stories are becoming more common. SO I will be giving other places a try from now on. Im done with the Hilton for now"
5977,Danielle,2023-09-03,5.0,"Exceptional Perfect location, easy to find and straightforward to find the airport parking"
5978,Alison,2023-09-03,3.0,Facilities fine but misinformation re transport infuriating resulting in considerable difficulty. Convenience for airpory Misleading information from staff regarding booking assist to get to terminal resulting in missing transport. Extremely difficult for us to get to the terminal.

5984,Anna,2023-08-29,2.0,Disappointing Over priced most uncomfortable sleep springs sticking out the matress Dirty bathroom
5985,Don,2023-08-29,5.0,Exceptional Room was silent from air traffic noise and spacious.
5986,Jessica,2023-08-27,0.5,"No water supply - entirely unacceptable!  There was no water supply when we woke up in the morning, due to a broken water pump, hence the poor ratings for comfort, value for money and facilities, and staff were completely unprepared and unhelpful in responding to this issue. We were unable to use the bathroom at all. Having travelled all day the day before and arrived very late at night, we were desperate for showers when we got up, but couldn't even wash our faces. Staff were clueless and didn't offer apologies or alternatives, it seemed no one had taken charge of the situation. Very poor from a large chain who should have effective contingency plans in place for critical services like water supply. A 30% discount was offered which was then not applied to our bill. I have complained and asked for a refund and await hiltons response."
5987,Alison,2023-08-26,1.5,"Expecting a luxurious stay but had to leave at 8.15 am with not even basic hygiene requirements met. Not hotel's fa I thought it was ok - rather bland but clean and comfortable The water completely failed on the morning of my stay. No shower, wash basin, nowhere to clean teeth, no ability to flush the loo or even make a cup of coffee. Guests not notified about this."
5988,Anne,2023-08-24,5.0,"Excellent for an overnight airport stay. Good sized room with two beds as requested, quick check in and good breakfast. Finding the hotel from the airport terminal was difficult as few signs - and roadworks made it difficult to see the access path."

5998,Stanton,2023-08-20,1.5,Would not stay there ever again. Glorified premier inn. Over priced for what you get. I was put up in a disabled room that stunk of urine. You have to pay extra for parking at the hotel. There was no mini fridge in the room. No room service and because of the location there was no shops to get food or drinks.
5999,Hayley,2023-08-18,5.0,Clean and comfortable Room clean and comfortable and breakfast was great Can’t think of anything
