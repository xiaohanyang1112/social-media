0,HolidayMaker4,2024-04-30,"Faulty air con / poor service Used as a base for an early morning flight. Ate in restaurant which was fine, portions quite small but service friendly and efficient. 
Had a family room and despite setting the air con we were all awake at midnight as the room was like a sauna, checking the air con unit it had a fault code flashing. 
Having to traipse to reception at midnight and their only solution was 2 small fans that gave off the same level of noise as a pneumatic drill was pretty poor. It seemed they were fully aware of the fault. They then decided to try and haggle / argue about what discount they could give. I just wanted some sleep so left the staff member and manager to argue it out. Still no refund offered weeks afterwards, we barely slept at all due to the temperature of the room and then 2 ridiculously loud plug in fans as the only solution."
1,laurietF4945KC,2023-06-30,"Fab spot! Zero complaints. Lovely bar and restaurant, fantastically friendly staff (especially the Spurs fan I met bartending), and the rooms are superbly kept and clean. A great stop the night before a mad-early flight."
2,johnsI1335TX,2024-04-30,"Ghastly hotel, ghastly food, ghastly beer. Stayed there as it was by Bristol Airport, and had the name of 'Hilton' associated with it. Room is nice, but there any praise stops. Ghastly burger type food, gassy commercial beer with little choice, no nice range. No cash accepted - I deplore that. If I wish to pay using my card that should be my choice, not this manky hotel's. Wouldn't stay here again, even the Premier Inns of the world are better hotels than this absolute dump."
3,chelskira,2024-04-30,"location is good Charged £200 for one night. The rooms are nothing special. Selection of food is poor. When checking out, charged £45 for parking even though was supposed to get discount?  WTF. Total rip off.  Think the manager is Dick Turpin
Anyone out there looking for a night, there are plenty of other places in the local area.  
This is not a slur on the staff who are all friendly and helpful."
4,owensB6496JD,2024-04-30,"amazing hotel lovely hotel ,all clean and tidy and rooms are spacious and only a few mins to Bristol airport main terminal which is ideal , staff are welcoming and friendly ,food is amazing  and would definitely recommend to friend's and family ,would stay again"
5,Chris100mk,2024-04-30,"Style over comfort Dreadful bed , hotel new and modern great facilities bar and food the room disappointing , style over comfort , less than a foot between bed and wall, wooden frame round bed your hurt yourself when getting in and out, mattress awful rock hard comfort level Zero"
6,janeycw,2024-04-30,"Beware of parking charges!!! I feel a little bad at the 2 star rating because apart from the unsmiling service at 5.30am (and possibly you can forgive them for that given the early hour)when I dropped off my door cards, the hotel itself is ok. The rest of the staff were friendly and very helpful and the hotel clean - it’s what you would expect. I even like the fact there is conditioner in the shower! This review is about the parking fee which is eye-watering and as I wasn’t expecting it has left a very sour taste in the mouth. £45!!! And that was to park for less than 12 hours!! The parking is owned by Bristol airport not the hotel but if I was any part of the hotel/Hilton I would hope that these poor reviews would propel them to try harder with the airport  to lower those charges for customers of the hotel. Bristol Airport you are rob dogs!"
7,DianeE300,2024-03-31,"BE VERY CAREFUL WITH PARKING CHARGES IN AND AROUND THIS HOTEL!!! This review is not to slate the actual hotel as the hotel it's self is OK and we had no issues with the hotel itself, rooms were comfortable, and breakfast was OK. 
However what they do not tell you before arriving is that parking overnight is usually charged at £60 a night which is ludicrous, this is reduced to £45 if staying at the hotel.
You only have 1 hr parking free upon arrival to check in and then u must use  nearby car parks, the pricing for these are very steep.
My main issue is that upon arriving home after a wonderful holiday to Egypt, I received a £100 fine for stopping outside the entrance to the hotel that evening after a meal in Bristol, for literally 1 minute to drop off my partner and boys before transferring my car to the silver zone car park.  Apparently it's a no stopping prohibited zone and there are lots of signs saying this, how exactly they expect you to be able to read these signs though when you are driving and it's dark I have no clue. 
I appealed it as felt it was unjust considering it was literally a drop off, and was literally less than a minute, but it's been rejected. 
So please please be careful whilst using this hotel. The land is privately owned and the car parks and the b******s will fine u for anything they can!!! I will definitely not be taking my car anywhere near this hotel car park again. I am not the only one who has been fined, my best friend also had a fine the day after myself, for literally leaving the hotel car park within her 1 hr slot.  And stopping to give way to a car coming from the right. How they can get away with this is just ludicrous, when she literally by law has to stop at a junction to give way to the right. Did they expect her to pull out straight into another vehicle approaching. Have seen other reviews on here also about it."
8,lynw367,2024-03-31,Convenient stay for Bristol flights Convenient hotel within a few mins stroll to Bristol airport. Clean rooms with a shower and 24 hour reception team. A fairly limited but good enough evening menu and reasonable breakfast is included in the room rate. Breakfast bags are availed for those with early red eyed flights!
9,picchio435,2024-03-31,"Modern, comfortable This is a modern, comfortable hotel. There was lots of space in the reception and dining areas. The food was fine and the bedroom very nice. They gave me an upgrade to a queen room with sofabed so there was plenty of space there too. The over all decor is modern , elegant and minimal"
10,442janec,2024-03-31,"Jane March 2024 Apart from not finding my booking initially the hotel is good. There should be water bottles in the room
My beef is my flight was the first out of bristol, got up at 3.30am for a hot shower...... very cold shower.
The rooms are not  cheap because of location..... step up please we all deserve hot water, we are all paying for it......"
11,Camper561875,2024-01-31,"Disappointed with huge fine for trying to enter car park Fined for briefly pausing whilst trying to read a sign next to the barrier to the car park!!
Previously informed via phone discussion with the Hampton by Hilton and also in their confirmation email that we could use the car park for drop off for up to an hour. We were surprised to see a sign about £60 charge and fines at the entrance to the car park so paused (for less than a minute!) to read this. Slapped with a £100 fine in the post for ""stopping"". It was dark, it was cold, we had a baby in the back seat who was just waking up and quite upset, we briefly paused to read the sign. I have tried to appeal this, sent the parking company a confirmation email and told that my appeal is unsuccessful. 

Needless to say I will not be staying again, I will also inform all my family and friends to make sure they never stay here either.

I have emailed Hampton by Hilton and await a reply."
12,BecciGlos,2024-02-29,"Let down by poor evening meal I have stayed here many times before and the staff are always warm and friendly. Room is clean and functional with good toiletries. However it’s simply not worth the money charged; the lack of competition sets this. The evening meal really let this occasion down; the food quality has been deteriorating and this time it was borderline inedible, washed down with £10 a glass wine. The restaurant could really do with some atmosphere; music, low lighting etc ? 
All in all it does need to improve or lower prices."
13,MrGJC,2024-02-29,"Convenient, but at a high price. The room, bed and shower are good. The bar/restaurant area is somewhat devoid of any atmosphere. The location is excellent for access to the airport.  I stay at this hotel regularly when travelling. My main gripe with this hotel is the price which has more than doubled over the last few years and I feel that it is now overpriced."
14,Kevandkaren,2024-02-29,"Average, pricey, but convenient An airport hotel of course so expect it to be a little pricey. This was a little too OTT for me  and with fairly basic standard rooms, food and service. Some staff came across as a tad rude and dismissive at times. Great location for the airport. Just a 5 minute walk and a decent enough, I’d stay again due to convenience and current lack of competition. Main bed in room comfy enough. Bed settee not the greatest. Very clean place."
15,Thamesbabe,2024-01-31,"Good rooms The room was very good and the digital key useful however it would be nice if a key for the electrics was already in the room. Common areas are like an extension of the airport rather than a hotel lounge.
Drinks are pricy and food extremely average. I felt unwell after eating there. I suggest buying something from M&S in the airport. 
Breakfast was adequate 
There is currently no pedestrian walkway to the terminal, you have to go through the multi story car park dodging cars. Hope this will be resolved sometime."
16,pagents,2024-02-29,"Parking rip off An average hotel, overpriced like everything near Bristol Airport, average food,terrible coffee,  good service.

The room was OK as expected, being on the third floor was too hot, and difficult to sleep when the bathroom fan never switches off!

They like to surprise their guests that parking is now £60 a night! Watch out for that!

Making a one night stay £220, it's Bristol Airport , Not Vegas!

Never again."
17,Road608464,2024-02-29,"Good room at the airport Clean, comfortable, large and very warm, lovely bathroom, slept very well and considering it is in the airport grounds I never heard 1 flight land or take off, breakfast was very good, would definitely stay there again, staff were amazing, the young boy that checked me in was a star and even helped me with a trolley for the trip up to the airport in the morning, I was extremely impressed with the staff there"
18,CJWilliamsHeatley,2024-02-29,"Lovely stay We stayed here the night before our trip to Rome. Check-in was great, very friendly staff of the highest quality customer service. The room was a perfect size and the beds lovely and comfortable. The pillows were a little too soft, but that's a preference not a complaint. Despite being next to an airport there was zero noise, couldn't even hear traffic. Plus, being at the end of the corridor prevented the usual ""hotel noise"" of opening/Closing doors etc. room temperature was easily adjustable.

We didn't eat that night but did have a coffee in the bar. Again, exceptional customer service. There is a handy section selling travel toiletries (all under 100ml).

Breakfast was great. Buffet style offering pastries, pancakes, waffles and full English. Can't fault it.

Will definitely be booking again next time we fly from Bristol. Hotel is just a few minutes walk to departures with handy signage from hotel to the terminal to make sure you can't get lost!"
19,mandymarytaylor,2024-02-29,"Well worth staying before you fly The staff were excellent, Chris & Stella(The Dream Team), sorted us out. The customer service was Outstanding. The hotel was Clean, Warm, Pleasant and Welcoming. The staff are very knowledgeable of their hotel and surrounding amenities, even using their own personal phones to help customers, nothing to a problem or to much effort. Stayed here before and definitely stay here again."
20,mickeyandminniemad,2024-01-31,"Nice hotel, pricey, but no alternative on airport grounds This hotel is pleasant and we had a good sleep before our early departure. They provide a continental selection for breakfast from 4am which was very useful when you have an early flight. We ate in the restaurant/bar in the evening and the food was ok, but expensive for the quality. We were lucky when we checked in that there were only a couple of people ahead of us, because a queue quickly formed and appeared to be moving very slowly.  We took the lift to our room and the lights to the rooms were off, it was very dark and I wouldn’t have been happy trying to find my way on my own. 

I must also add that the quick route from the hotel to the terminal is currently shut, meaning a much further walk around the car park and the back of the hotel, not great, especially when it’s raining."
21,Wander10741820991,2024-01-31,Convenient stop over Very comfy and convenient after a long journey. They are welcoming at any time of day or night and had a drink for us at midnight which was very welcome. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and again the timing makes it easy to leave for your flight early so they have it all geared around convenience for your flight
22,123pix,2024-01-31,"Convenient location with comfortable rooms Great location within minutes of the airport. Pleased with our room which was spacious and had a very comfortable bed. The restaurant was also pleasant with a reasonable priced  menu, apart from the wine which was quite expensive. We did have an issue with the overnight parking charge which was different to the amount quoted when we originally booked, but the management kindly resolved this for us."
23,PJAnderson83,2024-01-31,"£165 for 2 nights of parking Avoid this place like the plague! I stayed here for 2 nights for work and ended up having to pay £165 in parking fees! Not a single sign anywhere to highlight their extortionate prices. The hotel is as basic as a Travel Lodge, the food is utterly abysmal, and the bitter taste their parking fees leave you with, is enough to deter anyone from booking again. Shameful!"
24,Mis2006,2024-01-31,"Too expensive  A comfortable hotel, well positioned beside the airport terminal. It's comfortable and pleasant but somewhat overpriced! It's like a Premier Inn ...you queue to order food, wine is ridiculously expensive at over £8 a glass....... It's acceptable but it needs competition!!!!"
25,DevonJohn,2024-01-31,"Disappointing for such a Prestigious Name Used the Hotel to save an early morning drive to Bristol Airport with an 09:30 Book In to the Multi Storey Car Park. Check In was straight forward as was parking the Car in their Car Park. Very disappointed with the Bar and Eating Area which was untidy and looked well worn, even to the extent of having cushions missing from the settees, tables were uncleared and had not been wiped down. The meal was mediocre to say the least, expensive and not up to what I would expect from a Hotel of this name. The rooms and sleep quality were very good. Where you have to be very careful is the Car Parking, on check out you are advised to process your car park ticket through a machine in the Lobby, I assumed that it would just be validated for exit however, I was asked to pay £60:00 for the 1 night parking. Reception then told me that if I push a little white button the charge would be reduced to only £45:00.as I had stayed at the Hotel. Nowhere in the Hotel details does it advise you of these charges, it just say Car Parking available. It would have been better/cheaper for me if I had booked my car into the Multi Storey the night before and then just walked across to the Hotel. These charges are almost bordering on extortionate. then to cap it all, having paid, we decided to have breakfast only to find that when we tried to leave the Car Park that the exit time limit had expired and it would not let us out. I had to re-park and get the Receptionist to arrange for our release. They could do a lot to improve this Hotel but I will not be using them again."
26,davidsR7876DR,2024-01-31,"Not as good as previous visits The room was OK, getting here was a nightmare, as signage was poor. We ate in the restaurant which was OK, but we were charged 40 p more for our main course. We weren't shown a wine list and ended up paying £37.50 for a bottle of wine which costs 20 Eurosin Spain. Seemed to be a very expensive stay. Not good value for money."
27,598janed,2024-01-31,"Highly recommend Booked last minute after flight home was cancelled due to storm. Lovely hotel, comfortable and clean rooms, friendly staff, good selection of veggie options at breakfast, served hot food and drink in large clean bar area. Highly recommend, tho no complimentary toothpaste, which would have helped 👍"
28,Y9754WYmargaretw,2023-10-31,"Impossible to get to with airport expansion and lack of consideration for disabled people! No access for disabled! This is not actually the hotels fault but they should take action and put pressure on the airport. I booked a room having stayed there before and this time my flight landed past midnight. There’s a sign saying Hilton temporary route. This so called access is impossible for anyone with reduced mobility, with a walking aid or in a wheelchair. I was with my daughter on foot. She literally had to carry me to the hotel in the rain a pitch dark. It’s an absolute disgrace and the airport is responsible but the Hilton should never have allowed this or should provide free vehicle transportation."
29,mgraham2015,2024-01-31,"Great location next to terminal Excellent location right across from the terminal. Also right next door to the multi storey car park. Hotel was very clean, check in and out very efficient and friendly staff. Rooms were modern and comfortable and food options for dinner and breakfast were more than enough.....highly recommend."
30,odo3680,2023-12-31,Overnight at Bristol Airport We had a night here either side of an EasyJet holiday. Always liked this hotel it is so convenient and everyone is friendly and helpful. On this occasion my wife and I noticed that the beds in the Hampton by Hilton BRS was MORE COMFORTABLE than the bed in the 5 star resort that we spent Christmas at. We liked the straightforward comfort food available at night (on arrival). The order at the bar arrangement works well. Also impressed that the breakfast had non-dairy (soya) choices.
31,cliffcottages1,2024-01-31,"Fantastic location  Stayed here after late night flight home , so easy to access. Rooms clean tidy but very small tho for a stay over just to grab some sleep was fine . Breakfast was good . Carpark expensive and we were nearly charged £60 for 5 mins access staff did adjust this prompt for us ."
32,Carlaconsort,2023-12-31,"Still Good To Stay Just Don't Park ! Another one night stop over to enable the Missus to catch a very early flight, as with previous visits helpful and friendly hotel staff. Assigned a ground floor room, as before this again was immaculately clean and tidy. A basic uncooked breakfast available at 5am and cooked from 6am which is an excellent boon for early risers. Thus pleased with continuing high level of service at this hotel. However BE WARNED - Bristol Airport own the parking lot and have raised the parking charge from the £14.50 it was in October 2023 to £45 ! Had it not been for the hotel reception staff it would have been £60. How can this be justified ?"
33,429PaulP,2023-12-31,Rip off £60 to park for 0 to 24 hours. Disgraceful. I feel ripped off. Used to park there regularly for around an hour and didn't mind paying a premium for the convenience but clearly they have changed their pricing structure. No wonder the carpark was empty.
34,200ja,2023-12-31,"Great hotel  Brilliant stay, comfortable rooms and very friendly staff.
Had an amazing night's sleep.
The gym was a god send as I felt really lazy after travelling all day.
Would recommend joining the Hilton honours loyalty program as I got free WiFi and got a later check out time 😁
Will definitely be back!"
35,DevonPoohbear,2023-12-31,Another nice stay Stayed on the 10 December checked in by Jack what  lovely friendly chap nothing to much trouble. Also checked in on 25 December at midnight and Tom the duty manager went above and beyond. Rooms nice and clean. Lovely full English breakfast. Handy for late night arrivals who don’t want to drive after a flight
36,Chillibonbon59,2023-10-31,"Average except for the vegan breakfast  A bit impersonal for dinner (you have to queue at the bar to order and pay, then find a table) and there was only one vegan main course option /one vegan side, but the sweet potato falafels were crisp and tasty. Breakfast was a good choice of clearly-labelled options, kept properly hot, and I was given vegan croissants when I asked about bread and pastry options. The hash browns were excellent and the croissants were out of this world. Staff were polite - the older gentleman among the breakfast servers was particularly helpful. The room was pleasant, well insulated from exterior noises, and spotlessly clean. The high price reflects its proximity to the airport rather than any additional quality over regular hotel chains. I’d have given it 3 stars but the helpful server and the outstanding breakfast got it the 4th."
37,UkMd_,2023-12-31,"Lovely stay let down by the catering This is a well laid out hotel, the rooms are clean and comfortable, there is plenty of parking, the mini fitness room is good enough for a maintenance workout and the location is ideal for the terminal. That is let down by the catering. There are plenty of staff and they are all running around looking busy, but nothing is really getting done. When we stayed the restaurant wasn’t particularly busy but there was a 45-60 minute wait for food and even then people were waiting longer. The person sat next to us was offered two meals that were for another table and after waiting over an hour they settled for a pizza, even though that wasn’t what they ordered, but was the quickest food to get out. The lack of catering management continued into breakfast, with long waits for food to be replaced on the hot plate, broken catering machines and a general feel of disorganisation. If a hotel is good enough to offer a catering service then it should be adequately managed, which definitely lets this hotel down."
38,corrinet414,2023-11-30,overnight stay hotel close to the airport   does what it says on the tin   rooms comfortable clean    food    breakfast good   had a meal in the evening   wasnt great   will be better when construction work finishes   as acess to airport uphill   and not easy  for elderly  people
39,K8960LDabbyw,2023-12-31,"Wouldn’t bother again Felt like we were sleeping on a concrete mattress. I don’t normally bother with reviews but this was probably the worst night sleep I’ve ever had in a hotel. Was not worth the price we paid. What kind of hotel doesn’t even invest in decent mattresses?  
Starting off my holiday with a bad back."
40,Madsmids94,2023-12-31,"Monopoly at the airport very overpriced. The line for check in at midnight was outrageously long, full of families and children waiting to go to bed after travelling. The rooms were cheap, more like a £70 a night room. WiFi was not included which seems ridiculous in a hotel used often for business travel. The room was freezing. The breakfast and pillows were great. They just seem to have a monopoly at the airport and are taking advantage of it with the pricing."
41,A6701RSbilll,2023-12-31,"Perfect location for early flight. Couldn’t improve the experience I had. 

Early flight. 

Very clean and well equipped room (for what I needed).

Check in easy with polite and efficient front desk team. 

Restaurant as expected. Nothing flashy but a good enough menu and quick order to service process. 

Restaurant staff very friendly and on the ball. 

Room price included breakfast but unable to have it due to having to be at the terminal at 4am. 

Easy walk to terminal, which will be even easier when the work outside is finished."
42,618DavidB618,2023-12-31,"Excellent Airport Hotel, worthy of the title. I don’t often write reviews but I’ve got to give props when they’re due. A lot of airport hotels could learn from this Hampton at Bristol airport. The rooms are fresh, clean and comfortable. They offer continental breakfast from 4am, for those with early flight, and cooked from 6. For late arrivals they have a 24/7 menu, limited but still with decent choices to suit most people, and the bar’s apparently open until 2am. They are doing everything they can to make the traveller as comfortable as possible."
43,hollywills12,2023-11-30,"Not the best I expected more for a ‘newish’ airport hotel; well the only BRS airport hotel. 
Stayed in a family room, cots are very small compared to say a premier inn.
They wouldn’t heat up our baby food yet the bar manager said the night before they did for someone else but there was a new kitchen manager on and he said no. Wish he didn’t say that as we paid £7 for a tinned Heinz tomato soup with toast! 
Room was freezing (yes there was heating but it was blowing cold air all night) 
Duvets are those crispy noises bulky duvets and the pillows were like rocks!! 
I’d rather be sleep deprived and leave early next time!"
44,Cherriesfan99,2023-11-30,"Not a good start with a fifteen minute walk in the rain, and more to departures It was and still maybe a bit of a pain  mving our luggage and selves through the heavy rain in a bit of tour toBristol Airport departure - you can see it quite plainly from the hotel, but are forced to drag the cases through the car parks, up the inclines , cross 3 road, negotiate the mud left by the contractors to reach departures. Not a great start. Also the front desk at Hampton by Hilton could not be less helpful as far as directions. Could they not have had the insight to either produce a leaflet / map or at least have a notice board indicating the route and how long it would take to get to departures - for some this might be critical. For others with a disabilty or very young children they were on their own, quite literally. Currently there is no provising for transport  to the airport other than walking.
The hotel was ok a slight step up in quality from a travelodge, but a huge price difference. 
Evening meal was a bit of a shambles, so we skipped breakfast (which was included in our room rate). This probably our only visit to HbyH Brristol Airport."
45,kunchuu,2023-10-31,"Good Stay and Services all in one place Stay was absolutely good and Gym also available. Enjoyed my stay all the time and i visit regularly once a month. Points earned can be used for the later booking. 

Booking the room online also very easy 
Thank you"
46,ianrobbo5,2023-11-30,"Poor cancellation policy Very poor cancellation policy - I booked 2 rooms for a one night stay at cost of £252.
Had to cancel , unfortunately due to Covid and doing the responsible thing by not travelling.   Total refund was £0 even though I gave 3 full days notice.

Sorry Hampton and Hilton group you have lost our business."
47,colink956,2023-10-31,Overnight at airport hotel Overnight stay at hotel both before flight and return home .Comfortable room clean and modern.Good buffet breakfast other food available is of a fast food nature reasonable selection and pricing.Easy to book using app
48,714justind,2023-10-31,"Stranded in Airport. Great Customer Service We arrived into Bristol Airport at 1am in the morning and due to a serious accident on the roads outside the airport, 100s were stranded, with the prospect of spending the night in Bristol Airport. I rang the Hilton and spoke to the very friendly manager there called Tom. Tom couldn't have been more helpful,  going beyond the call of duty. ...he secured a room for me, my wife, and 2 young children at a reasonable price with a nice breakfast included. The room itself was clean, and the shower was also nice. would recommend! Thanks, Tom and the team!"
49,rock_30,2023-10-31,"Airport hotel Stayed overnight for an early morning flight. Location is ideal - right by the multi story car park and close to walk to the terminal. That’s pretty much where the positives end. 

Negatives:
- checked in and chose room via the app in advance but key card in app doesn’t work so have to check in at the front anyway (not much of a queue for us but noted it was much bigger later on!)
- Queue for food and/or drink was very big after 6pm. Food and drinks were ok, nothing to shout home about. Wanted a drink midway through my meal but would have meant a +20 minute queue while my food got cold! 
- Kids menu was terrible (chicken nuggets or hummus (not and, or) for £8!! 
- Snacks (those you’d normally have from a vending machine) are via the same long queue above (ie bring your own or go hungry!)
- Pull out bed in room was very uncomfortable and double bed in room was small. Considering this is a Hilton and we paid £200 for the night this was very disappointing. 
- We didn’t use the hotel car park but noted it’s £5 for 0-20 minutes!
Overall it’s convenient for flights, but unfortunately monopolises the market here. 

Not the greatest hotel from the Hilton empire!"
50,mairew2013,2023-10-31,"Not to Hilton standards Stayed here overnight before an early flight. Room was absolutely fine, comfortable bed. The restaurant left a lot to be desired - more like a fast food cafe where you have to queue up to order and the food is mediocre. It is advertised as being 3mins walk from the terminal but as an elderly couple with luggage it took us at least 15. It is uphill and was not easy for us. Fortunately it wasn’t raining! There is a lot of building work going on so I suspect the path may be better when this is complete but some form of transport for less able guests would be appreciated. Breakfast was available from 4 a.m. which was good."
51,jtwitc283227,2023-10-31,On site airport hotel Great for an early flight as short stroll to airport (currently not very direct due to works). Hotel was pleasant and good breakfast included starting at 4am. Evening meal was the only disappointment and needed to queue at bar to order it.. Perhaps better to go to the airport.
52,103rachbecky,2023-10-31,"Lovely  We checked in around 11.30pm 22nd we are checked in by the lovely Manager on duty, excellent lovely customer service with a smile. Quick check in, confirmed if we weren't happy with room they could move us due to me asking if was quiet room, fantastic service! Room was lovely, same design as the Newcastle upon tyne one that we stayed at last Christmas. Was a a joining room next door but I think the complete tiredness from long day traveling, the time difference caught up on us, the though moving our luggage all the way to another room,  We were just happy with lovely clean room. Grateful for the sleep and comphy bed! Went bar get drink all I wanted was hot chocolate night cap and the lovely receptionist went above and beyond. I cant have dairy so with quick thinking she put some hot water in tea pot, dairy free milk in Jug with chocolate powder in seperate cup. It's service like this that I love so much! There was no such thing as a no in her mind and her creative thinking just made my night a perfect end to such a long day. thank you so much so sorry I didnt get your name. Breakfast was lovely had lots alternative to milk options from Yogurts to milk, cereal, spread and even vegan sausages. You have to excuse my excitment as I just came back from Turkey and alot of my food options had milk in it so it was truly refreshing to be back to alot of options again. Highly recomend Hampton by Hilton, was 10-10 place to stay with lovely staff from Evening & Morning"
53,Cranberrypumpkinpie,2023-10-31,"Good staff, basic hotel for inflated price. Handy for early flight though. Stayed for 1 night prior to 0600 flight from airport.  Hotel is clean and tidy but VERY overpriced for what it is.  I would say more like an upmarket Travel Lodge to be honest.  We were in our room less than 12 hours - didn't check in till 4pm and left 0300 to check in at the terminal. So, easy money for them as we hardly made use of room.
Room very clean - issues were with air con and inability to open a window - even a small amount = meant we woke up with thick stuffy heads due to not having any fresh air.
We ate in the bar - surprisingly the food was ok.  Not huge portions but very reasonably priced compared to price of the room.  I thought they would have inflated the bar/restaurant prices but not so.  
We did not have breakfast as we had to check in early - they did offer a takeaway bag but at 0300hrs neither of us felt like eating.
The trek to the terminal is longer than normal and I am limited mobility - what I found most difficult is that you are walking into the arrivals 'traffic' of people and they are all walking towards you when you are walking TO  the terminal and nobody moves out the way and there is no separation between arrival and departure walkways so it's a bit of a bun fight and if you are poor mobility it can be a bit daunting.  Not helped by steps, uneven surface and lots of trollies in the way - not at all helpful and would be a nightmare for someone with impaired vision.
The staff at this hotel were VERY good - jolly and helpful (especially one blondish girl on reception who was very chatty) - but at check in times there was a bit of a queue so more staff are needed."
54,jennym73,2023-10-31,"Night stay before our early morning flight We had a early morning flight so thought we would stay the night before as it’s a 5 minute walk to the terminal. Check in was pleasant, room was quiet small and the bed was very hard and uncomfortable. 
Room was nice and clean but there wasn’t any decaf coffee and not enough milk so had to go down to reception to get some.
Breakfast at 4.30am was only continental which was fine with us. 
We left the car parked in the hotel until we came back which was very convenient too."
55,jaydoubleyou1969,2023-10-31,"Perfect for a late or early flight We arrived back from holiday at 00:40 so decided to stay here before travelling home, and we are so glad we did. The room was stunning, with a huge shower and very comfortable bed (exactly what you need after a four hour flight). Breakfast is from 4am to 11am, we caught the end of the service but it was still really hot and fresh.

The only (slight) downside, which isn't the hotel's fault, is that due to building works the walk from the terminal is more of a trek than usual but it's still great to get through security and be in your room within half an hour! Would definitely stay here again if we were flying out of Bristol early or late."
56,Flyer17972783839,2023-10-31,Worst hotel experience  Absolutely worst experience we have ever had with a hotel. Received an email the day before our stay confirming we had two rooms booked for one night prior to our early morning flight. Arrived at the hotel to be told our booking had not gone through properly on their system despite the email. No rooms were then available so the incredibly rude receptionist left us stranded for the night not offering any assistance until she was told that one of our party had health condition and even then was finger pointing to her colleagues rather than offering much assistance. Completely put a dampener on 30th birthday celebrations. As well as going on to cost us extra when we eventually did find a place to spend the night. We will be putting in a formal complaint but felt it was worth offering an honest review to avoid disappointment for others. Would not recommend to anyone
57,lordieCornwall,2023-10-31,"Extremely bad sewage smell coming from air con Raw sewage smell coming out of air conditioning, sickening, too late to move rooms as we have an early flight in morning so have turned it off but left with the horrible smell in the room 
This needs to be sorted out 
I’m staying here at this hotel tonight 20th October 2023"
58,ShelbyOH,2023-10-31,"Sharp as crystal in Bristol. Check in was flawless, this Hampton had light-years better facilities than the US Hamptons. There was a gentleman working in the restaurant named Nick who couldn't have been more accommodating if he tried. Our room was clean and the main areas seemed freshly updated. The only complaint about the room is the design choice of translucent bathroom doors. The light is very bright and can be disturbing to others in the room that are trying to sleep.

The hotel's proximity to the Bristol airport was the main reason we chose it, but be forewarned that they do not have a shuttle, it's about a five to ten minute walk to the terminal which can be a struggle for mobility impaired guests."
59,shonac358,2022-11-30,"Great location for air travellers This chain offers a good standard which gives you confidence to stay. Close to Bristol airport so great if you have an early or late flight.
Bar and restaurant so you needing head out and can relax from the moment you arrive."
60,Ich-Dien-Cymru,2023-10-31,"Great service, bathroom needs a bit of attention We stayed like many others before we took a flight out of the airport, service was faultless, rooms were fine, just felt the decor of the bathroom along with the hardware needed attention, shower head awful, toilet seat loose, apart from that all okay"
61,neilw300,2023-10-31,"Great stay Checked in on Saturday afternoon for an overnight stay at this great hotel prior to flying early next morning.We cannot fault it hats off to the lovely young fella on reception who checked us in very friendly informative and efficient he has a great future in hospitality along with every member of staff we encountered everyone was so friendly the waiters bar staff and reception staff could not do enough for you.
When we mentioned a quiet room the receptionist put us in a quiet area on the second floor and I must say that the door and window soundproofing was top notch we never heard a thing .The rooms were very very clean and we will definitely be staying again on our next trip.
Only minus but my opinion is that the hotel is a card only no cash hotel we watched a few older couples get into a flap at the bar when they got cash out to pay only to be told card only and bizarrely the car park pay machine (maybe not hotel run ?) was cash or card what a lovely option."
62,jonathanp631,2023-10-31,"Would definitely recommend We chose to combine this hotel and parking offer through TUI as we had an early morning flight and it seemed good value for money. Check in was friendly and swift. The staff were helpful throughout our stay. Rooms were spotless and looked brand new. Beds were comfy and usual facilities excellent - tv- Wi-Fi - tea and coffee tray.
As we had a really early check in for our flight we intended to pop over to the airport, check in and then pop back to the hotel once breakfast started. We mentioned this to the helpful receptionist in the morning and she presented us with a breakfast to go. How brilliant! 
We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone travelling through Bristol airport."
63,MonstrousPippin,2023-09-30,"Very comfortable and convenient Excellent stay for one night after a late arrival flight. Very efficiently checked in, lovely comfortable room, nice bar area and very reasonable check out time of 11am. All the info you need is easily accessed from the info card in the room or the interactive telly. Very comfortable bed with plenty of pillows and very clean. Tea and coffee facilities in the room. Breakfast was good on the day we were there. The hotel is handy for the Bristol Flyer shuttle bus too. Would definitely use this hotel again if my flights are at odd times."
64,MrsBB2000,2023-09-30,"A high price for the convenient location  This hotel is all about the location, if you arrive/depart very late at night or very early in the morning it is a most convenient location of course only a short walk from the terminal.  

Greetings at reception were warm and the check in very efficient.  

Annoyingly  the next day no one could tell me where the Uber collection point was or where the taxi company was situated, no collection from outside the hotel, so a little annoying.  Most hotels have a map so they can easily point out these types of locations, or staff that can easily explain them. 

I did find the Uber collection point and when Uber decided they couldn't be bothered to collect me on a busy Sunday morning Arrow Cars situated just outside the terminal provided me with transport, it was a good service if a little on the expensive side.  Of course now I know more about the set up of the airport I would either catch the bus into Bristol or arrange transport with Arrow.  

The room was bog standard but seemed to have excellent sound proofing which was great!   The sink drain was blocked but other than that every thing such as towels and cleanliness was all good. 

Its a shame that Hampton hotel and Arrow Cars have a monopoly in the airport which adds to the high prices.  As the airport grows alternatives and a railway connection would be good. 

The breakfast was dreadful and the worst I had in the UK that week.  The food was so hyper processed and poor quality, although the Ubley yoghurt was good.  I felt for such a high price, such a terrible breakfast was annoying!  I will try in future to pay extra for better flight arrival/departure times so I can avoid having to stay near the airport at all, my bad, my lesson learnt."
65,sizmursan,2023-09-30,Rgis year's stay We chose this hotel because we enjoy staying so close to the airport but in quietness. The rooms are excellent and the service is proficient. The hotel does need to employ more staff to cope with evening meals as the tables are not ready for reoccupation quickly enough. The staff do their VERY best!
66,PJAnderson83,2023-09-30,"Priced like a 5 star, but no better than a budget city hotel. Priced like a 5 star, but no better than a budget city hotel.

Rooms are very basic. Modest size but fairly 'clinical'. Clean, but basic. Staff seemed friendly enough throughout. 

The worst part by a long mile though was the food and restaurant. It's like a school canteen. Menu is very childish: chips, burgers, pizzas and a couple of other bits. No table service either, you have to order and collect at the bar. When food was ready, you're also told cutlery is somewhere else. Loads of staff loitering doing nothing, yet it's all self service? Bizarre! 

I had the daily special curry which was a Madras: straight out of a jar! Stale popadom which bent rather than snapped, over cooked rice, accompanied by a tasteless, meatless curry. Naan bread was like play dough too, just awful. £17 for the curry, £7 for a pint of lager!

Don't be fooled by the brand ""Hilton"". This is comparable to a basic city Travel Lodge. I shall never return: it would make more sense to stay up to 30 minutes away in a better (Spa) hotel, and get a taxi to the airport... you'd still save money too!"
67,carolyneg728,2023-09-30,"Overnight stay Overnight stay b4 early am flight.Not cheap buy excellent clean room with comfy bed and great shower.Breakfast was amazing,best one I have ever had in a hotel...well worth the money.All staff friendly and helpful.A definate one to stay again in.No complaints at all."
68,PhantomAde,2023-09-30,"Good overnight stay This hotel is the best one in terms of location at Bristol airport, there is building works so a slightly longer walk from the terminal but is not too bad. Like the fact you can pick your own room and check-in on the app if you like.

Room had everything needed for an overnight stay although flannels would have been nice for the shower. Room was very clean and quiet and enjoyed a meal at the restaurant. Menu not the best or the cheapest but was OK and would use again."
69,PhilipD591,2023-09-30,"Great night's stay at the airport at the beginning and end of our holiday. Very friendly and helpful staff.  Comfortable beds.  Delicious breakfast with lots of choice, including GF options.  You can get 1 hours free parking to pick someone up or drop them off with their bags which is really useful if parking at the Silver Car Park.  Highly recommend."
70,maggie2628,2023-09-30,Clean hotel and friendly staff Lovely clean hotel and rooms. Staff very friendly and helpful. The food was lovely and a continental breakfast was available for any early checkouts. Very close to the airport which is especially good if you have twilight checkin for your flight. Parking was expensive on top of the room rate which was the only downside.
71,Newquay_or_bust,2023-09-30,"Very disappointed I rarely leave negative reviews and only when strictly necessary and when someone might listen. 
First off the room was dirty, it literally looked like someone emptied a hover bag between the pleats of the curtains. 
The restaurant seats were grimy and loads were just shells with the covers completely gone. 
Expensive! Blimey, you’d think we were staying at the ritz the prices of the drinks and food, yes I’d expect to pay more but come on, there is a limit to ripping people off!
Very very very dissatisfied but once bitten twice , never ever again"
72,C8056OClucye,2023-09-30,"A dreadful experience. This was a dire experience as the start of a holiday. Whilst the room was ok (clean, adequately equipped) the catering was appalling. To order any food or drink you had to queue in an airport security arrangement of taped aisles. We ordered  two white wine spritzers and a packet of crisps for £22(!) to start and specified dry wine with soda. Neither the guy at the till nor the assistant behind the  bar had any idea what wines they sold or what type they were. We opted for one but when we got them to the table the ‘soda’ was lemonade. I took them back and explained that I had reiterated soda. She made me two more using two different sofa streams. One was indeed soda but the other was still lemonade. When I took them both back to the manager and asked for a refund, having lost heart and hope, she didn’t believe that one was lemonade as ‘it would have been more bubbly’. She declined to taste it.  This was as insulting as it was rude. I got a refund and went to the airport concourse and bought a super bottle of M&S wine for £10. Sadly there were no restaurants open in the evening before Departures so the hotel has a monopoly on food. Their menu is very limited, unimaginative and heavy. No salads. Not even fish and chips which would have been a safe bet. In fact, the watery chicken korma was ok though there were no side like mango chutney or raita (obvs). It was very beige. 
In addition the ambience, lighting and seating are like a hospital waiting room - and two banquettes had no seats, just holes to the floor. It was a depressing and frustrating experience and an awful start to our holiday. And it’s £172 for the cheapest room!  A total rip off. We didn’t risk the breakfast next morning. We will avoid this at all costs in future and fly from another airport if possible."
73,JuliaH590,2023-09-30,"Couldn’t fault anything but the price! I rarely write rave reviews so this is an exception.

I have nothing negative to say about this hotel.  It was convenient, nice room. decent sized towels for once, a comfy bed and an above average breakfast than you usually find  in airport hotels.  Charming staff and a warm welcome despite it being 1 in the morning.

The only downside was the price which I thought was very high for a 3* hotel but they are the only hotel at the airport and so I suppose can charge whatever they like as there is no competition.

I would, despite this  recommend the hotel."
74,roseym413,2023-09-30,Overnight stay prior to flight. Absolutely wonderful stay. Easy to find and park. The staff are so friendly - the rooms are relaxing and comfy and it is so convenient for the airport. Holiday starts here!! Now sitting in the room after a good supper Well done to the hotel and staff!!
75,SueHind,2023-08-31,"The Hard Beds meant very poor sleep The general experience at the hotel was good from arrival, serving of a meal, cleanliness, quiet room and leaving early the following morning. We had stayed due to a very early flight and had hoped to have a good nights sleep. Due to the hardness of the bed even sleeping on top of the duvet was not enough. It was such a basic issue and not one easily resolved so left at 3 am for the flight with no comment. In the future I will see if they have extra duvets I can  sleep on! Or stay at Premier Inn down the road"
76,melsimcoe,2023-08-31,"Comfortable stay We stayed for two nights on the 28th and 29th August as our flight got cancelled due to air traffic control problems and our flight was rebooked for the 30th August. Reception advised that there were no rooms but online it showed availability so we booked on line. It was expensive at £217 a night but conveniently close to the airport a one minute walk and I felt safe. The staff were friendly and polite nothing was to much trouble. There was a computer with a printer for free use so we were able to print our new boarding passes. We ate both nights in the restaurant, the menu was limited but good food and quick service and there was a children menu. Drinks were expensive £7.50 for a pint.
 The room was spotless and the beds were really comfortable, we had a good night's sleep. For breakfast you could have waffles, toast, cereals, fruit and a choice of a hot food to name a few. Vegans and vegetarians were catered for. This is my third stay at the hotel and I highly recommend it if you are flying from Bristol, although I do feel it's very expensive but you are paying that high price for the convenience."
77,E7716CJpaulb,2023-08-31,"Cannot get the room 50 mins before 3pm Shame when you arrive at 2.10pm you are left to wait in reception for the 3pm check in time or pay 10 pounds extra. Why when the room will be ready and it’s not really early.
Poor show and wasn’t like this last year or the year before.
Hotel is dead quiet. 
Poor customer service this year.
Will try another hotel next time."
78,G1893NSelizabethh,2023-08-31,"Ideal for an early morning start. Very nice hotel , right on the doorstep to the airport, very convenient for a 06.30 flight.
Welcoming friendly staff.  Spotless rooms, no noise heard. 
Food in the bar was fine , if somewhat limited menu and was expensive as were the drinks .
All in all a pleasant overnight stay, I would book again ."
79,918kelleb,2023-08-31,"The perfect start to a holiday! I booked the morning before we were due to fly as a last minute decision. The reservations team were fantastic; confirming availability almost instantly. 
On arrival, the reception staff were attentive and polite. When we explained our flight was before the breakfast service commenced the following morning, they immediately offered a take-out service. 
Our room was perfectly adequate for our family of 4.
We ate in the bar/restaurant onsite, and thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Again, the staff we encountered were all very good.
On check-out the following morning at an ungodly hour, the receptionist was efficient and polite, providing us with 4 bags of continental breakfast, each containing a croissant, juice box, piece of fruit, and a cereal bar.
I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are flying out of Bristol, and we will certainly be booking again."
80,jacquelinemD1032VE,2023-08-31,"Great for the airport  Fantastic spot for an early flight. Very clean and comfortable and well run hotel. Room was generous and very quiet, no aircraft noise. Early breakfast could have been a little better. Had to ask for a bag to take away but it was a very small paper bag. Can imagine a later breakfast would have been nice though."
81,DawnP233,2023-08-31,"Great overnight stay 👌  Last minute decision to try and avoid the early morning drive and it was a very good decision 👌 

The double room was clean, so comfortable and the sound proofing was out of this world 😍 Had such a good night sleep before the flight 😍

Had the early continental breakfast which had a good range of food and plentiful in supply 😁

Only downside was the additional charge for parking overnight as that wasn't included in the price 

Would definitely stay there again 😊"
82,X1994HAjm,2023-08-31,"Plain awful - if I could mark it nothing I would Your staff on check in, Hannah and colleague from F&B are so far away from any form of any customer hospitality, what an awful check in.
No nice welcome (good evening, how was your travel..anything really) 
Considering you welcome weary guests from all around the world, this is lacking any form of kindness and plain customer service.
The entrance to your hotel is not evident with the current works happening at 11pm at night. I fed this back on arrival and the response was ""there are signs"" and ""it's not us doing the works""
I had prewarned the hotel works of our arrival time and noted I was travelling with my dad (in his late 60's and frail and my toddler). No mention of this, with the darkness and the line of bus goers, we missed it.
I appreciate it's not your works, however the response was plain awful. A sneer from the lady in the f&b uniform and a laugh from Hannah as we were walking away. Talk about school bullies. 
Maybe some more training in customer service would be welcomed. 

It’s not cheap to stay and be insulted/mocked within 2 minutes of arrival, but you’re guaranteed it at the Hilton Bristol Airport.

I see from past reviews that a lack of accountability is served and most guests who review negatively get a cut and paste response.

Do better please. Simply unkind and very unwelcoming."
83,slargemail,2023-08-31,"Don't bother staying here! We got to the hotel late after 1am due to our flight into Bristol being delayed. When we got to the hotel to check we were told they only had accessible rooms available as rooms are allocated on a first-come basis. What is the point of asking what room you would like during the booking process then if it's ignored? I feel they took advantage that we were arriving so late.

The room was basic. The shower floor was slippy so I had to put a towel on the floor. The bathroom looked grubby and there was a slight smell of poo from the drain in the shower!

We were tired and there was no point complaining as the only rooms they had left were accessible ones anyway!

The room was not worth the £161 I paid, it was worth about half of that!

If I could find a way to complain on their site I will be asking for a refund or a least a part refund!

Next time I will pay a little extra and just get a taxi back to Devon if we get a late flight back. Never staying here again!"
84,MrsSamC,2023-08-31,"Holiday ease Great hotel, the staff were all friendly and were on hand to help with any questions and being only a minutes walk to the airport, made going to the early flight so much easier. We will definitely stay again when flying from Bristol."
85,cruisegirl50,2023-08-31,"Lovely hotel. Great staff. We stayed for one night before flying to Edinburgh for our 30th anniversary. The hotel is only a short walk into the terminal. 
We had a fabulous stay & it started our holiday off really well. 
The hotel is spotlessly clean, our room was lovely with nice comfy bed & pillows, lovely shower etc. 
The staff at reception and the bar staff were super friendly. 
We ate in the restaurant which was fine. Not a great range of food on offer but what we had was lovely washed down with a few drinks. Actually, as an anniversary gift the hotel gave us a voucher for a couple of drinks at the bar. So unexpected but a lovely thought. 
We will definitely be back and can recommend this hotel."

Extremely convenient, only a few minutes walk to the terminal.
Had a meal at the bar in the evening, limited menu but good tasty food.
Would definitely recommend and use again."
87,BigFoodlover0,2023-08-31,"Where has good old customer service gone???? 😢 Having paid nearly £250 for an overnight stay and a glass of wine each the night before our flight, I was notified that I'd left a small item in the room which the hotel agreed to post to me. The cost was £1.15 and if I wanted my item, I would have to pay the £1.15!!!

The hotel was ok, room was ok, but it is already overpriced for what it is, purely because there is little alternative choice. To have insisted I paid the £1.15 to get my item back made me laugh, but on a serious note it showed complete lack of customer service and complete focus on profits. 

Come on Hilton - Surely you could have spared  £1.15 out of your £8 Billion worldwide Profits last year!!🤣🤣🤣"
88,DottyDoodl,2023-07-31,"Recommended. Excellent location for a pre-flight overnight stay. Staff very helpful, rooms clean and quiet. Would use again.

It felt like being in Wetherspoons! The mattress was terrible. Very lumpy and felt a bit like a bed in a travelodge. Obviously the whole point is being so close to the airport and that really is great but....there needs to be a lot done to improve quality.

94,daveincheycode,2023-06-30,"Good room, poor breakfast  Access to the hotel from the airport was good although there are steps involved - not easy with luggage. The check in was smooth (3am !) . The room itself was great, spacious and clean. Good shower. 
The one disappointing thing was the breakfast.  It was a basic buffet with very limited choices. Only scrambled eggs available for the English breakfast and that had the appearance of being cooked in a plastic bag. Premier Inn breakfasts are far superior to this. I expected much better from the Hilton Brand. (£213)
Having said that, it is very convenient to stay there and I would fo so again."
95,ScotonAlderney,2023-06-30,"Very good stay A pleasant overnight stay. We checked in early and were told if we joined the Hilton loyalty scheme we could get into our room immediately.

Evening meal was self service but a wide choice of eating time which was helpful.  Minimalist menu choice but adequate. Breakfast early in the morning was really good with full English available. Pleasantly encouraged by the whole overnight if on the expensive side!"
96,joymN6644AF,2023-06-30,"Ignore the negative reviews! Ignore the negative reviews about this brilliant hotel!  Firstly the Reception staff are amazing given that they know most of their clients will be at the hotel less than 12 hours.  They are polite and friendly.   I have probably stayed there 6 times in 2 years and have never heard any plumbing noises.  Book here for peace of mind knowing you are at the airport and a stone's throw from the check in desk.  Even if you do what I did this trip and sleep through the wake up call you can still make it in plenty of time!

Whether you book a room airport facing or airport car park facing you will find things quiet, but the car park facing rooms are perfectly quiet and my favourite.  Yes the price is a little expensive but you are already there!  Yes the food and drink is expensive and the menu is limited and unvarying but there is something for everyone.  I have always stayed on the top floor, floor 3 so that I dont hear people walking over head.  I haven't ready any review that this is a problem however.

I always use this hotel before a flight and sometimes after a flight depending on the circumstances. 

This time (ten days ago) I used the gym for the first time. It is  spotlessly clean, well equipped and has plenty of COVID cleaning measures still in place.  I pretty much had it to myself.  

The only negatives about this hotel are the coldness of the rooms in the winter months but you can ask Reception to over ride the room controls and heat the room for you.  You will also have to ask them to stop the heating over ride too when you are warm enough.  The breakfast is what lets the side down.  Every time I have stayed here the tables have been sticky, probably not wiped down from the night before.  The choice of food and the food itself is a bit lack lustre and doesnt match the quality you find in every other department.  You can perfectly well find food to eat but its a bit of a downer.  But given that you are at the airport and you eye is on the clock it doesnt matter that much. 

Book, you won't regret it."
97,505katherineb,2023-06-30,"Great location and ideal for families for an easy time Great location and easy for the terminal. The cost of the car park is outrageous given we are guests. The food, although nothing special was served quickly and hot and did us well. We were missing covers for the cot but the staff very quickly fixed this problem. Good selection of drinks served quickly. Early breakfast from 4am. Good wifi and hot water, AC, large room. Would recommend for families just for the location and easy for the airport. The restaurant is big so plenty of space for our toddler to wander without getting in people’s way."

101,amysO8414QI,2023-06-30,"Quick stopover  Lovely quick stay in hotel. Very good at blocking noise from room, but we had a room with an assessable bathroom that didn't drain properly, which made it impossible for the second guest to use, ending up going into the adjourning room for a shower which my sister was staying."
102,charlestonfarrell,2023-05-31,"Penalty Charge Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport I had an overnight stay with my wife and daughter at this hotel on 24.05.23 as we were travelling to Paris the following day. Bring from Birmingham and unfamiliar with the surroundings, I can remember slowly driving up to the hotel car park entrance and eventually gaining entry and parking in the hotel car park. Having had a lovely stay  I returned from work today only to find a penalty charge from Bristol airport stating that stopping outside the barriers of the hotel car park was unlawful and I've been summoned to pay £100. This has angered me so much and I bet I'm one of many that this had happened to, yet still the hotel didn't make any efforts to prioritise and emphasise this issu3 to its guests and I'm absolutely disgusted at this lack of communication and I for one won't be returning to this hotel in a hurry nor recommending it."
103,WHUfan,2023-06-30,"Great! Needed to stay for a couple of nights. Accessible room. All the staff were very friendly and helpful.
Rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable. Only issue was carpet looked old and stained-time for an update, please!
Would use again!
5min from Arrivals/Departures!"
104,combatchez,2023-05-31,"Just ok We chose this hotel due to an early flight the following day. We used online check in and our phone to unlock the room door. All excellent and easy to do making it less stressful all round. 
The room on the face of it was fine, we decided to get a drink at the bar and a couple of chocolate bars, oh dear!!! The prices were horrendous…..more so for the chocolate bars, make sure you bring your own!! 
We then went back to the room to watch tv and relax, the tv was cheap and nasty……the sound quality was so bad it vibrated the whole set. We had it at such a low volume in the end we couldn’t hear what was being said. 
The sink in the bathroom had somebodies tooth paste smeared around the back of it and the shower had hairs in it. 
We did complain and we were offered another room but we declined as it was too much hassle to re pack everything just for one night. 
I just felt that maybe an offer of a free drink at the bar instead would have gone a long way and made us feel a bit more important as customers. 
All in all it was just ok, if there was another hotel to choose from I’d seriously consider it"
105,Y5894YAsamb,2023-06-30,"Our mistake … but your professional care sorted it. My husband traveling with our 11 yr old  son who has a disability unfortunately last minute was told he’s late night flight was delayed, he quickly realised  traveling back to wales from Bristol at this time was not safe due to tiredness so booked this hotel, due to stress he booked the wrong date which said  non refundable which when realised caused utter stress again!! I called and spoke to Stella on front of house! Wow she was amazing! So calm and friendly and sorted  everything very quickly!  Thank u Stella for making our nightmare disappear! I wish we had more like you!"
106,TeamPB,2023-05-31,"Great hotel - bring a packed lunch. Ok so this is a great hotel.  Clean, well placed, nice atmosphere and comfy rooms.  Minor gripe - we booked a family room and the kids were on a very small fold out bed.  They just about managed but it was not ideal.

BIG GRIPE - do not eat here the food is terrible.  Worst £45 I ever spent on food."
107,FERGVSFOOD,2023-05-31,"Can you afford not to stay here ? It's been a few years since we last stayed at the Hampton, COVID and the cost of Living crisis sharply focused the mind on what's is important.
But we finally needed a holiday and flying from Bristol there really is no sensible option.
Why would you not stay at the Hampton?
Sure you could save a few quid and drive up or stay near by and still drive up.
But honestly I can't see why you would bother.
The staff , many of them I remember from my last stay , are amazing. 
Seriously the welcome I got was worth the extra money alone.
That  all comes down from a strong management ethos.
It runs through the whole team.
Rooms are great , food a little limited, but perfectly acceptable.
Drinks overpriced, I wouldn't have expected anything else.
But the convenience, that's what you pay for.
A complimentary continental breakfast from 4 am is very welcome.
I will not stay anywhere else when I next fly from Bristol.
I don't believe I could afford not to."
108,billw301,2023-05-31,"A calm haven After a very disappointing (non) early bag drop at departures a warm  welcome from Thomas In reception was much appreciated

109,LM82,2023-04-30,"Excellent airport hotel Brilliant airport hotel across the road from the terminal - seemed very new inside. The glazing must be excellent as we hardly heard anything from outside once in our room. Rooms are a really good size for an airport hotel, bathroom very new with a great shower and more toiletries than normal airport hotels. Extensive buffet breakfast was also included."
110,Serdeau,2023-05-31,"Excellent airport hotel Excellent airport hotel, bright and very clean, with a warm welcome from Louie the duty manager. Room was large with a seating area, very comfortable bed, and a sparkling bathroom. A super self service English breakfast was included in the price. Car parking available, otherwise a short walk to the bus station and the air terminal."
111,Brodiejaye,2022-06-30,Nice stay food choices minimal v Had a lovely stay here. Room excellent but minimal food choices and expensive for what they were. We went out to eat at a local pub and had a great meal which was far better priced. Never the less it’s a good hotel
112,lpaset218477,2023-05-31,Perfect location and really helpful staff We had to catch an early flight and the location was perfect. Complimentary breakfast from 4am was an excellent addition. The room was very small for 3 adults and the sofa bed was not very comfortable but perfectly acceptable for one night.
113,Traveller78,2023-03-31,"A really nice hotel Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport

       We stayed at this very nice hotel the night before our flight.  Overnight parking at the hotel was £14.  The parking ticket needs to be validated at the reception, then at the payment machine next to the lifts the payment is made.  We checked in our flight hold luggage the evening before our flight, and it was a 5-to-10-minute walk to the airport terminal.  Most of the walk was in a covered walkway, up to the point where you cross the road.  Then you can either take the steps or use the sloping walkways to the terminal.

       We had a high floor room which faced the airport terminal drop off and pickup point, this made for interesting people watching.  Cold breakfast starts at 04:00 and hot food starts at 06:00.  The hotel looks to be very new, and our room was very clean, fresh, and new looking.  There is quiet air con and heating which seemed to work in a delayed manner, but it kept us at a comfortable temperature.   The room has the usual facilities; soaps, kettle, tea and coffee.  

       This is a very nice hotel to stay in, most notable points are its clean and fresh feel along with very helpful staff."
114,PhantomAde,2023-04-30,"Great stay I had a very warm welcome from the reception team at the hotel and had a great experience. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was super comfy. The lamp in the room didn't work but apart from that the facilities were excellent and had a very comfortable night. Breakfast was good although if your a vegetarian there aren't lots of options, I also found the orange juice very watery, perhaps there was an issue with the machine but what was on offer was nice and would definitely stay again."
115,richardB602,2023-04-30,"Louise and Team Worked here today whilst waiting for a plane to arrive, Louie and the team really looked after me - very impressive. Mad to feel welcomed, decent coronation chicken sandiwch for lunch - will visit again."
116,Okhrana,2023-04-30,"Overpriced but great location We spent one night at the Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport. The hotel is conveniently located just steps from the air terminal.

Check in was smooth and we appreciated having our parking validated before taking our car rental back.

The lobby is modern and impressive, complete with comfortable seating areas, WiFi, a bar and restaurant.

Our room was very nice, spacious and clean, BUT there was NO hot water in the shower the morning we checked out! This was a great annoyance considering we paid 145.60 GBP!!

The restaurant provides a number of hot meals at affordable prices. I ordered the vegetarian curry and found it bland, the naan bread and poppadom clearly came out of a packet. My husband had the chicken parmigiana and was disappointed because it had been microwaved.

The hotel certainly had its pros and cons, however, I expected more considering it was a Hilton."
117,CiaoAntonio,2023-04-30,"Superb location Great staff and really good food 👍 Great staff …comfortable hotel lovely room and fair prices for food and drink given they are only hotel on site. 
We had the curry and pizza meals at £13.50 each and they were superb highly recommend this hotel ….yes it’s not give away cheap but you can walk into terminal in 7 mins tops and enjoy your holiday so treat yourself!!"
118,SalH100,2023-04-30,"Excellent place to stay right next to Bristol airport. We had a twin room which had two very comfortable four foot beds. Everywhere was spotless & newly fitted. Large bathroom with plentiful supplies of toiletries. Breakfast was very good, everything topped up & fresh. 
Of particular note were the staff who were exceptionally helpful & courteous which is remarkable when you consider that because of the site of the hotel the majority of the guests would only stay one night."
119,H6148UHtracys,2023-04-30,"Great airport stay Very surprised how friendly and helpful every member of staff were, from check in to the restaurant. No grumpy staff here! Hotel a short walk opposite arrivals and departures on airport. Very clean inside and room well appointed. Tea, coffee, good quality shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and hand soap provided. Safe, iron, ironing board and hairdryer in room. We had a snack in the restaurant in the evening and it wasn't expensive, service was very quick and the food was very tasty. Rooms are sound proofed, so no noise from outside at all. From our experience in April 2023, we would highly recommend this airport hotel."
120,oonaellis,2023-04-30,"My stay at the Hilton Never heard of the place . A friend , who uses it often introduced me to this hotel .

121,grahame745,2023-04-30,"A great stay. As usual, an excellent stay. Comfortable rooms and a very good night's sleep, good food in the restaurant for evening and breakfast meals and so convenient for the airport. Check in staff are very welcoming."
122,Wendywoo1603,2023-04-30,"A great stay to start your holiday with a great night sleep. Living in Exeter we usually travel to Bristol and use the Silver Zone parking but this time with an early flight we thought we would stay the night before flying off to our destination.
We were really happy with our lovely room and slept so well. Could not even hear a plane!! It was so quiet.
The food was lovely and just what we needed to start our holiday off. The staff were really helpful and pleasant."
123,LashyDavid,2023-02-28,"Not cheap but not classy The Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport is a fairly new hotel. It’s within easy walking distance of the terminal and breakfast is served from 4am (with hot food from 6am) for an early flight. We had a spacious room with a good shower and comfortable bed and the hard-working staff were welcoming. However, in an area very like a motorway service station, it has a very limited evening menu – sandwiches, baked potato, burger, pasta, pizza, curry – and the evening we were there, we had to queue for 20 minutes just to order. Meanwhile the automatic doors kept opening every time someone walked past, letting in the cold February air. And then things got worse. Our room was very cold and, although the air conditioning was set to 21.5 degrees, it just blew in cold air.  We could find no instructions for the controller and the bed had a very thin quilt with no extra blankets so we had to wear some of our day clothes to be warm enough to sleep.  To some extent we were unfortunate but we paid £158.65 for a booking that could not be changed or cancelled in a hotel which lacks class. This is 2 or 3 times as much as an equivalent hotel a little further away so it’s a lot extra to pay, just to be close to the airport."
124,W76QRdeborahm,2023-04-30,"Thumbs down for the breakfast The staff wasn't very nice or knowledgeable
The breakfast pack was a disaster. I had to leave for flight check-in before the breakfast was served, and had a bag with 2 old looking clementines, a pack of apple juice, a meagre croissant and a peanut bar? I could be allergic. I would have preferred no breakfast at all, but the hotel insisted because they did not want to refund the breakfast.
It was packed, and I was put in a wing full of teenager scouts going for a trip, and this because of my early checkout?
Expensive for what it is, they rely on location for price."
125,DevonPoohbear,2023-03-31,Nice hotel Lovely hotel as close to the airport as can be .nice stay before our flight and on returning flight. Good full English breakfast included in price nice. friendly staff. Would highly recommend this hotel
126,clarebond,2023-03-31,"Corporate hotel with a heart and great team We arrived late having had our flight to Faro cancelled owing to French air traffic control strikes. Louis and Chelsea made us so welcome, finding 2 immaculate rooms for the night and offering supper and a full breakfast in the morning. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and exceeded all expectations, even bring freshly baked croissants at the end of breakfast. Coffee was top quality..Lauren organised a late check out at no extra charge. This is an efficient corporate hotel but don’t be fooled, it has a real personal touch, such as you would find in an expensive boutique hotel.. thank you all."
127,marieh166,2023-03-31,"Super hotel,super short stay. What a super hotel,walking distance to the terminal and a lot of that under a canopy.We stayed just one night lovely big room super comfy beds there was no room to room or corridor noise all the normal tea,coffee etc mind you a biscuit would have been nice…just a thought Hilton.We ate there good quality food quite impressed…pricey but we expected it.Breakfast starts with a very good continental at 0400,fresh fruit,cereals,toast,etc very good choice we had an early flight so very very handy,full cooked stated I believe from 0700 hrs..all in all this was all very very good,BUT a very pricy to park 3 & half nights £105 ..
We will definitely stay there again but will park in the multi-storey,our friends parked there a lot cheaper."
128,LouiseLeader,2023-03-31,Perfect for a pre or post flight stay  Nice quiet hotel. Easy to find. Beds comfy. However would be good to accommodate families. Booked 2 rooms for 5 of us. Including a pre teen and teen. I had to share a bed with with my six year and nearly slept a wink! Breakfast was good and open early and we were not disturbed my noise.
129,UKtoEgypt,2023-03-31,"Great hotel for a restful nights sleep Great hotel. Just a few minutes walk from the airport terminal, really convenient. Lady on reception who checked me in was lovely, friendly welcoming and helpful. Room was a good size. The level of sound proofing was incredible! So quiet, a great place to rest before/after a flight. 

One downside was the bathroom. I appreciate that the room was fully wheelchair accessible, but the shower flooded both times it was used as the drain seems to be in the wrong place and water flows easily around the floor. Also, only accepting card payments at the bar is very inconvenient. I do not have a UK card, and wanted to avoid any additional bank charges for transactions abroad by paying in cash but this was not permitted. This should be thought about by management as I cannot be the only traveller who choses to pay in cash. Otherwise, a great stay and would recommend for a restful nights sleep."
130,Thamesbabe,2023-02-28,"Very convenient and comfortable The hotel is in the airport a few minutes walk from the terminal. You do have to negotiate some steps which can be awkward with heavy cases.
We booked a room due to a late flight arrival. The room was absolutely fine with a comfortable bed and good shower. 
The complimentary breakfast was as expected having stayed in these hotels before. 
I thought it was overpriced but as there is no choice of alternative hotels then it is what it is. 
We would happily stay again."
131,jackiecV9995WB,2023-03-31,"PLEASANTLY SURPRISED  The hotel was well signposted, car parking very easy and close to hotel. Louis on reception was extremely helpful and pleasant as were his colleagues. Our room was very comfortable and clean, as was the bathroom. Plenty of mirrors and good lighting.  Food was hot but I knew it would be fast food as the Americans do not excell in cuisine in the majority of their chain hotels. However it was served with a smile and was edible. On our return, very helpful staff helped my husband and explained how to pay for the parking. Altogether a very pleasant stay and so easily accessible for the airport. Will definitely stay again."
132,songbird2301,2023-02-28,"Very disappointing. Having paid £135 for my room,I expected it to be warm and comfortable.Unfortunately,it was chilly ,even with the thermostat on max,and despite telling Reception twice ,it remained chilly.I was offered an extra duvet which arrived with a separate cover. I struggled to put it on. The only 'easy' chair in my room was not comfy and in fact the room furniture reminded me of a budget Ibis hotel.
The hotel is of course convenient for the airport,but next time I'll book into one of the local B&Bs and get a taxi to the airport."
133,chrisnB7807AO,2023-03-31,"A rip off Slightly inferior to the average Premier inn at three times the price of b&b for two! Give it a miss unless you really need to stay at the airport.
 Reception staff are nice is about the best to be said about it."
134,Beachandsea,2023-03-31,"Enjoyable overnight, but cold room and average breakfast Welcoming staff, with extra  help at breakfast from Graham and Laura.. Room very clean and well equipped, with no external noise -  but was cold on arrival and took a while to warm up. Bed very comfortable with fine linen. Walk in shower and shower gel excellent.  Breakfast was good, but scrambled egg was a bit dried out and tasteless.  We were being collected after breakfast and driver had no problem having his  parking ticket  validated by reception staff for free exit ( they allow 1 hr for such short visits ). Very convenient for airport. We around £149.00 for one night.

Tip : If coming off a flight with extra luggage, eg ski or ski boot bags as well as  suit cases, it is worth paying £ 2 for a trolley at baggage arrival and you can then get to the hotel easier via gradual lowering pathways, across  from the  airport exit.  If you are going to a flight with extra bags, it may be worth going up to the airport  car park first where, like we did when going on holiday , and found a number of trolleys left by others - and didn't have to pay for one !"
135,wendyhowieson,2023-03-31,"Excellent for the Airport Stayed at this hotel on the 25th February for a next day flight.  Went to Reception to be greeted by the absolutely lovely Chelsey who greeted us with the most beautiful smile.  She was amazing, thanked me for me a Hilton Honours member, described everything in detail and told us to come straight back to her if anything was unsatisfactory.  Chelsey is an assess to the hotel. Room was clean, lovely towels,adequate space, safe,comfortable beds.  Food in the evening was fine, the usual quick meals, if you want anything other than that then this is not the place for you, after all this is an airport hotel. Breakfast was nice, quite a choice but be nice to have some tomato.  Cannot fault the night we spent there before our flight.

We stayed on our return on the 5th March.  We checked in at 12.30 pm and our greeting was so different.  No happy Chelsey, we were greeting with a chap (didn't get his name) who never even smiled and the only thing he asked was our name which I had to give him 3 times before it registered with him.  He handed us our room key and still did not speak. I asked what time breakfast was as we seemed to think it changed in the week.  He told us it was until 11.00 am.  I queried this with him 4 times but he still said 11.00 am.  We thought as we were late in we would sleep in a bit so we went to breakfast at 9.30 only to be told breakfast finished at 10.00.  At 9.50 am breakfast was being taken away. We were not happy as we like to enjoy our breakfast and not have to rush it down.

I would have given this hotel 5 stars but the chap on reception lost them the extra star, nevertheless I would still stay at this hotel.  I do hope though that this member of staff is spoken to."
136,homebrew_author,2023-03-31,"Good but car park & breakfast were problems The sign posted car park rates are truly horrendous.

£5 to drop guests off at the hotel, at pricing for room there should be no need to try and fleece them for simply getting out of a car.

That said reception staff were great and we validated ticket which appeared to get our parents out without charge.

Why not just allow a drop off in a their secure car park without the hassle.

Room was very clean but also very chilly. I do wish hotels would warm room prior to guest arriving, we've paid for it.

Bathroom was clean with lovely shower.

Be warned.... If on an early checkout you might not get the breakfast you paid for. We asked and we were told take out bags for breakfast would be available. Got down at 04:10 and told sorry no breakfast available to go.

A lovely clean corporate hotel with great staff but if you're on an early flight I'd recommend trying one of local guest houses within 800m. You'll pay less for room which means you'll have extra cash to pay for the breakfast you'll be forced to buy at the airport."
137,kitc672,2023-02-28,"Wonderful customer service! Thank you Lauren❤️ After having missed our flights in an absolute flap, we fell into the Hampton in a total panic and were welcomed by incredibly friendly and calming staff who offered to help in every way they could and somehow managed to make us feel glad we were starting our holiday a day late! Have to say a special thanks to Lauren at the front desk who just went to all length to make us comfortable and happy! What a lovely lady, went far beyond her job requirements and was a genuine delight to meet!

Plus best coronation chicken panini ever!!"
138,Punders1,2023-02-28,"Comfortable rooms but disappointing food The bedrooms are on the basic side but very comfortable.  And it’s handy for the terminal.
The bar/lounge/dining area is grim with zero atmosphere.  The food is of poor quality and in some cases has been “changed” to what they have described on the menus they have placed on the tables.  Breakfast is basic and below average.  Premier Inns are generally of a higher standard."
139,thedogsbutcher,2023-01-31,Awful food What has happened to your menu? We have stayed 4 times now and the last 2 times the food has been absolutely awful. Microwaved burgers which are hard around the edge. It's not cheap to stay here either. Pull your socks up as it used to be great

The following morning Down to a full complimentary English breakfast with fresh fruit cereals and hot drinks."
141,Inspire690193,2023-02-28,"Do yourself a favour; go elsewhere! What a terrible, ghastly depressing place!

Overbright reception staff, appalling impersonal room, the much-vaunted breakfast had excellent bacon, but dry hash browns, tasteless scrambled eggs and some black stuff they claimed was coffee but wasn't.

Worst of all, and adding insult to injury, was the fact that you had to,pay a rip-off extra £5  just to drive to the front door; at reception when leaving the next morning, I heard two reception staff laughing over the fact  that some poor person had got stung for an extra £40.  And they thought it was funny!

You will have a miserable time here and be overcharged for it.  Go somewhere else, i implore you!

Conrad Hilton must be spinning in his grave."

A large bathroom with all you need in shower  & body moisturisers etc.
Hair in the soap tray & also on a wall in the bathroom, hence why ive scored this down.
The dinner menu is basic on a folded laminated A4 piece of paper which is cheap & tacky."
143,richarde602,2023-02-28,Poor breakfast  The hotel is in a very convenient location to the airport offering clean comfortable rooms. Breakfast is included but not a cooked one before 6am. Before this time it is what is described as a continental breakfast which to be fair is poor at best. The hotel should as a gesture of fairness reduce the room tariff and offer a Breakfast at a supplementary cost

147,Safety2202,2023-01-31,"Terrible hotel do not stay here! I’ve stayed at Hilton hotels many many times and they are excellent however I’ve learned that Hampton by Hilton hotels is just another word for terrible, poor and rip off name division for Hilton hotels. The food is microwaved and the service is equally as poor. I would never recommend this hotel. If you like Weathspoons you’ll love it here"
148,daydreamer538,2022-12-31,"Glad I booked This hotel made it so easy for our early morning flight. Easy to park, check in, our room was a good size fairly basic but very comfortable.

So easy to just walk across to the airport in the morning via a walk way from the airport door to the departure door - fantastic will definitely use again."

151,Swale64,2023-01-31,"OK but OMG the food!! It is what you expect from a hotel built to service early morning departures and late evening arrivals. So the rooms are functional, small but well presented and maintained. But the dining offering is no more than a feeding station. It would work for cattle and sheep but the fare is limited and fairly awful. This is NOT fine dining but equally it is not what truckers would accept in a transport cafe. My cheesburger with chips was some form of processed meat which had clearly been overcooked and burnt at the edges several times before, had no taste and was tepid at best. The cheese slice which had been added was soft but not melted. The the chips were good. The staff appears to have little culinary trainihg and warm offerings are microwaved on demand. Guests are a captive audience because, apart from the airport terminal, there is nowhere else to go. It is more than disappointing that Hilton lends it name to this  disappointing monument to accountancy greed."
152,BrixhamColey,2023-01-31,Another good stay. Good clean and nice rooms. Rooms appear quite well soundproofed for an airport hotel with coming and going at all hours.

Will be using on a regular basis now.

155,Z6321LErichards,2022-12-31,"Convenient but overpriced Great location, however that’s where the advantage ends, room cost, menu cost,  parking costs all at a premium level, a shame the experience does not live up to the expectation.
Evening menu choice poor , order at the bar and pay before eating, wait for ever even when not busy, just like a motorway services, except here the room was over £150 a night!
Parking for one night additional to the room cost, it’s not a city centre location, we were told they have to charge so much  as it’s part of their agreement with the airport! Well let’s just pass it on to the customer then!"
156,GMLLoyd,2023-01-31,"Could be better The bottom sheet did not fit the bed. The duvet was thin and there were no extra blankets. I expected better from this chain.
 Useful location for pedestrian access to Bristol Airport. Breakfast was served early to accommodate early flights."
157,Slcbryant,2022-12-31,"Great airport hotel Great location for an early morning flight.
We parked at the short stay car park the night before and it was a simple 5 min walk to the hotel from here then straight to the airport again in the morning. Continental breakfast was from 4.30 too. 
Rooms were clean and modern as expected with a typical hilton hotel but also very quiet"
158,Birdman1983,2022-12-31,"Decent Easy check in
Clean
Nice breakfast
Room a bit small for luggage but other than that good value for money.

Sldo right next to the air port so easy to get into Bristol air port the next day.

Other bonus is that breakfast starts from 4am."
159,Amanda23-Scotland,2022-12-31,"Could be better  I was a bit disappointed with this hotel as I have used this brand before and it was amazing.

Our family room was very small felt almost claustrophobic as the child's bed was so close to the bigger bed. And it was so worn out it really dipped in the middle therefore an uncomfortable sleep.

Breakfast was also disappointing well below expectations.

Staff where friendly and approachable.

It's literally just across the road from airport but I would drive that little bit and choose another hotel."
160,AnnaT991,2022-12-31,"Would recommend! We stayed here prior to our flight in early December, I can’t recommend it enough, so close to the airport and a really nice comfortable hotel to stay, breakfast was included which was really good, plenty to choose from. Will definately book again if flying from Bristol airport!"
161,workingtitle,2022-12-31,Exactly what we needed Perfect location for our early morning flight the next day. Staff are all welcoming and friendly. Really comfortable beds and room was spotlessly clean. We enjoyed a light evening meal and breakfast was freshly made with good choice. Just what we needed.
162,stuartw800,2022-12-31,"Nice hotel, terrible food offering Hotel review first of all, great check in experience, very friendly staff, rooms are to a good standard and nice amenities. Same staff member checked me out and was brilliant.

Food offering is terrible. Dinner is a folded A4 menu, limited choice and nothing better than pre made, overpriced and poorly presented food. Stood in a constant queue of 8 and more to order just like a Wetherspoons, after food you need to I’ve on and order drink separately. Food was appalling quality at dinner and same experience at breakfast. Lukewarm food, poor quality food, dirty uncleared tables, bins were filthy and shocked at how bad the hygiene was

In summary, hotel is great, food is very poor verging on a joke, for a Hilton and the prices charged they should and must do better. Food service completely lets this hotel down"
163,richieh102018,2022-12-31,"Great for early morning flight Stayed here for the night before a flight from Bristol airport.

Very nice hotel looks as though maybe recently refurbish (or kept to a very high standard)

Staff are friendly and the food was nice. 

Strange that when you check in you have to authorise your card at that point to later put food and drinks into your room (which we didn’t do). It just means that each time you order food or drinks you have to pay there and then which isn’t the end of the world but is a bit annoying all the same. A good night sleep, comfy bed, 5 mins walk to the airport… perfect.

Only thing to be aware of is that the parking is controlled by the airport not the hotel, you get a discounted rate the night you stay (£14 instead of £20 or something like this)  which I found a little off as other Hilton’s I’ve used offer a park and fly rate which this hotel would definitely benefit from being able to offer."
164,markhP7403DK,2022-12-31,"Dirty and unwelcoming The room was very cold to begin with and after a few calls and an email it was turned on … unable to alter the heating as it was overridden by reception I was told.  If it gets too hot I was to call reception to reduce the heat …… takes a while to get reception to answer.
Headed down to the restaurant which was the Concourse area ….. tried three tables and all were sticky and one had hair stuck to it. Menu was either burgers or curry …… or a sandwich….. sandwich came out and was thin cheap bread and not even buttered …. Seven pounds …. Waiter was very friendly and professional.  There was queuing system with barriers at the bar where you have to order your food and drinks …. After a wait I was served by an unfriendly female member of staff … ordered the food and a drink … was given a place located and told to come back for the drink … it will be placed on the bar when ready.  Awful experience."
165,Carlaconsort,2022-12-31,"Utilitarian Appearance Shields Good Comfort Within Exemplary service from the reception staff, as at very short notice had to book another room since wife was stranded in that joke of an airport Dublin ( three days to get from Dublin to Bristol must be some sort of record ! ). Which they did in a matter of minutes; excellent service. First room functional comfort, clean and tidy, with a large comfortable bed. Commendably quiet too so a good night's kip assured. Second room of equally good standard - 362 has a ginormous telly by the way which was an entertaining diversion. Breakfast a most acceptable serve yourself affair with a good range of options, cooked from six am onwards, no limits set as what you can have. Evening meal  also enjoyable and not too pricey, with staff attentive and helpful. All in all a well run staging post very well situated a few minutes from arrivals and departures. Just be aware   that parking is a tad expensive, so make sure to get parking validated at reception on checking out."
166,suzieNorthumberland,2022-12-31,"Better than expected Wasn’t expecting much for an on-airport hotel but was pleasantly surprised. The room was well designed to maximise use of the space and had comfortable 120cm wide beds and an excellent shower.
Breakfast was OK buffet style, with cooked breakfast available from 6am. Didn’t try the evening offering.
Special shout out to Alex Wall. My husband has limited mobility and airport assistance can only be pre-booked within the terminal itself. Alex arranged for OCS to transfer me to the terminal from the hotel reception and also arranged for his reception staff to confirm the arrangements a couple of hours ahead. Everything went smoothly on the day with no stress.
Only negative was that the room was very cold when we arrived and took a couple of hours to warm up."
167,katie19842015,2022-11-30,"Great hotel, Great food, Perfect for the Airport! Me and my husband stayed here either side of our Cyprus holiday in November. Check in was easy both times, and both rooms were perfect. 

We ate lunch and evening meal at the first stay and used the 24 hour menu, and breakfast at the second. All food was lovely, and bearing in mind you're in an airport hotel, and a Hilton, the food wasn't expensive.

All the staff we encountered were very pleasant and really helpful! Overall 2 lovely stays. Thankyou very much!!"
168,grapow,2022-12-31,"Nice room, good staff but that’s where it went downhill! First the good news, the room itself was fine, in fact to a high standard but so it should at the prices they charge, more than €150 per night! And the staff were excellent!
Our main gripe was the restaurant process, a queue to order and pay and then a different queue for the drinks . However what pushed our patience beyond the limit were groups of young kids running around the tables screaming and generally out of control. I must ask, why don’t the hotel put out a message asking parents to control them. This relegated the hotel to the same level as an Ibis, in fact it wouldn’t be tolerated at an Ibis!"
169,GillianPMR,2022-11-30,"Good for an early flight Good for one night . Clean room and with in walking distance of the airport so very convenient . Didnt have food there but had a couple of drinks in the bar area with friends. Drinks were reasonably priced 

I would use again as very convenient if you have an early flight."
170,YachtSuzannah,2022-11-30,Great location average rest Location brilliant right opposite terminal.  Very modern but cold both in hotel temperature and atmosphere.   Not made to feel welcome.  Cold and clinical lounge area with airport style lane queuing system for bar and food service.   Feels just like an airport lounge.   Too stark.  No real restaurant just huge open ground floor.   Won’t return.      Off airport and taxi next time
171,Jimmyrn85,2022-11-30,"Food is awful, not good value for money Accommodation is clean and to a high standard. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the food. 

Poor choice, poor quality food that is just microwaved rubbish, yet has the price tag of much better restaurants like ones found in Premier Inn. 

Based on how poor the dining experience is, I won’t stay here again."
172,Breakswiththelakes,2022-11-30,"Thank you Lauren! I wanted to say a special thank you to Lauren, who made our stay extra special. We stayed the night before travelling to Disneyland Paris with lots of kids and adults. The room had a mini treasure hunt with Disney characters and the kids LOVED it- so thank you so much. Everything was clean, organised and the staff are amazing. Short walk to the airport."
173,Messyplay,2022-10-31,"Ideally located There is literally only one negative about this hotel, so I will start there. It is very expensive. We paid nearly £300 for one night with parking in Silver Zone for one week (for two adults sharing).
The hotel is right next to the airport; on the same site really. This makes it very convenient, especially if you have an early flight like we did.
There is a good choice of food for an evening meal and it’s not extortionate. Very tasty too (I had the falafel burger and fries; my husband had the curry). 
All of the staff are very friendly, chatty and help in any way they can. 
The rooms are spacious and have everything you need including shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, body lotion and so on. Also tea and coffee in the room, which is an essential for me as I can’t function without a cuppa when I wake up, especially when the alarm is set for 03:30!
The bed was comfortable. 
The entire hotel is immaculately clean. 
Breakfast is included in the price and starts at 4am. There was fresh tea and coffee, bread for hot toast, cereals, pastries, fresh fruit, yoghurt, muffins and fruit juice. If you didn’t have time to eat it all, there are paper bags to put it in to take to the airport, as well as paper cups with lids for your hot drink. 
If you need to check out before 4am, you can just pick up a bag with a simple breakfast to take to the airport. 
Cooked breakfast starts at 6am, but I can’t comment on that as we checked out at 04:20.
Despite the high price, we would definitely stay there again if we have an early flight from Bristol."
174,BecciGlos,2022-10-31,"Another great stay night before an early flight Another excellent stay at this hotel (early morning flight from Bristol). Check in was warm, as usual they allowed us to drop off luggage before moving our car to airport parking. Room was fine, sofa bed all set up for our daughter, all immaculately clean especially bathroom. Restaurant / bar is big and spacious. Drinks highly priced but good. Service friendly and efficient. Food as always is just ok and the menu is quite limited however it is fairly priced. Slept well, considering there must be so many comings and going’s there is never any noise. We left a little later than usual and was surprised at 4am there was a continental breakfast out Inc coffees and takeaway cups etc. When we’ve checked out at 3 in the past we’ve had a breakfast bag. Rooms are highly priced however this is the only hotel on the airport site. It’s worth it especially if you’re flying with jet2 to drop off luggage night before as part of their twilight service and then just walk (literally couple of minutes) to security next morning. We just treat it as another night of holiday. Only reason not 5 star are prices and evening meal quality."
175,Amykidd84,2022-11-30,"Disappointed We booked this hotel as had a early flight the next morning with my two young children.
Easy to find , clear instructions and very close to the terminal.
Upon entering our room we noted it appeared dirty / food under the bed.  
We then left the room to find “ housekeeping “ running and chasing each other with what appeared to be the  linen trolley . This likely explained the poor state of our room.
We informed staff at reception whom were polite and apologetic and ensured us the room would be cleaned straight away .
Food in the restaurant was very nice and generous portions.
Upon returning to the room we noted the sofa bed to be hard and uncomfortable- we addressed this at the time and were told that all the rooms are the same . The only option we had was to possibly book and pay for another room . Having just paid £280 we felt this was totally unacceptable . 
The location of this hotel is great , but sadly I don’t. Think with the experience we have had we would stay here again . The staff could have done more to make our stay enjoyable - but it appears they do not care ."

177,G8070UJerich,2022-10-31,"You will not be disappointed  Become a Hilton honour’s member definite benefits  Early ish flight so thought this would be a good start to our holiday had there been a beach, pool and guaranteed sunshine  I think we would have stayed. Who would have thought a sea view ( well Bristol Chanel ) walking to the room which was clean, fresh and airy. Returned early very early from our holiday ,yet again brilliant check in welcoming staff and service also added to the Hilton benefit’s of a English breakfast followed by a few hours undisturbed sleep wake up to relaxing shower then onward home. I have to say less is more. Our 5 star vacation didn’t meet up with our outward and return experience with Hamptons."
178,Colinmc400,2022-09-30,"All good for one night, for the early flight. Same as most people, stayed one night prior to an early flight. The room is quite tight,  but it was very clean, modern, firm bed and a great shower.  Nice touch to offer a breakfast bag, for those leaving before the restaurant opens."
179,EstellePorthcawl,2022-10-31,"Excellent experience  We stayed here for one night before an early flight. 
We had a lovely, warm, informative welcome from Alex.
Spotless, comfortable room, couldn't hear any plane noise,  but did hear other people leaving to catch their flights,  understandably.
Quieter, shutting doors would have helped.
I used the fitness centre, which was located on the 1st floor, a nice facility.
Fabulous choice for breakfast at 4am and well presented.
Check out was easy, just leave the key at the front desk. 
Really close to the airport,  5 min walk,made things so much easier for us in the morning and also for booking in the luggage the night before.
Thoroughly recommended. 
A really enjoyable stay, thank you."
180,allan-lesley,2022-09-30,"Ideal location. Walking distance from check in, suitably double glazed so we  didn't hear any plane noise.Comfortable bed. Limited evening meal choice and breakfast not of the hottest although there was a  good choice."
181,veyges1,2022-10-31,"Annoying extra costs etc The first annoyance was finding the room with a freezing air conditioning going full blast at 11.30pm!

The second was having to pay £3 for a cheap toothbrush and a miniscule tube of toothpaste, actual buying cost probably 25p.

The third was having to sign for the above item!

The fourth was finding breakfast sausages cooked with sugar: yeech!

The fifth was having to pay £14.50 for overnight parking - a scandal for a hotel of this supposed class."

Was smooth Aaron was lovely but we went down to the bar and the restaurant area and was very cold and ask the receptionist if it could be any warmer he was very polite and said he would but it didn’t get any warmer do people putting on coats and jackets to sit in the restaurant area and then asked again and he explained that he was not allowed to make it go above certain temperature his name is Alex and he was a very nice guy I apologise for being grumpy old man and he said at least you are polite please Hamilton Hilton when it gets colder make it warmer so people can sit in your bar there was a lovely bar receptionist waitress her name is Stella One of the best sense of humours of ever experienced keep her and double her Pay"
183,barrynash1,2022-09-30,"Extremely convenient for early morning flight from Bristol Airport Very convenient for the airport when we had a early flight the next day, especially as we could do twilight check-in the evening before.  Good service at Reception and clean, comfortable room.  Our evening meal in the restaurant was good value, and the take-away continental breakfast available from 4am was a bonus."
184,OonaghP3,2022-09-30,"Very poor first impression! My husband and I booked this hotel as our return flight was supposed to be landing at 2.25am. We had never stayed in a Hampton before.
Our flight was delayed so didn’t get to the hotel until 5.15am and totally exhausted in need of sleep, given our room key and made our way to the room- when we walked in the bed was unmade and the remote control was lying on the unmade bed and there were wet towels all on the floor! 
So after a long and delayed flight I had to go back down to reception and ask if that is definitely our room as it’s dirty! The gentleman laughed and said I’m sorry that room was supposed to be cleaned and give us another room. 
Poor first impression and for £198 I will never stay there again! Avoid!"
185,Milvertonfamily,2022-09-30,"Great start to a holiday! Perfect location for an early flight from the airport next door. 
Friendly staff, quick check in, quick service at the bar. 
Will definitely stay again!
Busy but plenty of room in the bar.
We did eat in the restaurant and enjoyed our meals.
Breakfast is well organised in the morning, tasty and ideal for a long flight ahead! 
Basic room, very cheap paper thin toilet roll but comfortable stay!"
186,Jase1489,2022-09-30,"One night stay Stayed here for one night due to a family event near by. Hotel was really easy to find and plenty of parking available in the Hotel car park (although for a fee). Room was comfortable and clean which is all you can ask for! Breakfast was okay, nothing fancy just a regular self service English breakfast plus the usual continental options. Tables in the didning area could’ve done with a bit of attention, wiping down etc after each person. 

Also, bought two glasses of wine in the bar the night before and it came to just over £14! Might be because I’m a northerner and used to cheaper prices but it did seem a bit over the top! 

All in all though a good stay and it would definitely be a go to if I was in that area again"
187,DeniseO546,2022-09-30,"No breakfast available as promised We had to leave before 4 am for our flight. The evening before the receptionist  informed us that there would be plenty bags available with continental breakfast between 3 and 4 am. When we came downstairs at 3.30 am to collect bags the breakfast area was shut, the doors opened 2 minutes later , but no bags and breakfast choices not fully prepared."
188,reyres473414,2022-09-30,Excellent Lovely service from reception staff. Clean room and nice size. No sound from the airport. Leaving early for our flight we were greeted with a breakfast bag to take with us. Would definitely use this hotel again.
189,topbananaBristol,2022-09-30,"Would definitely recommend Myself and my husband recently stayed the night before an early (6am) flight. We left the room at about 3.30am so you could say was it worth it, but we definitely think so, had an early night so still had good nights sleep. To us it much more preferable to driving up that time of the morning! 
Everything about our stay was great. Room was immaculate, bed very comfy. We had a meal in the hotel that was very good. 
There was an option to take a breakfast bag they were left on reception but we didn’t . Think they contained a pain au chocolat, cereal bar and juice. Can’t remember the other item. 
Would definitely recommend and we have already booked another room for our next holiday in February!"
190,jillcB4893OH,2022-09-30,Excellent on-site airport Very easy to book check in and a very comfortable stay.  Room had all amenities on tap inc iron and ironing board which is useful to have in room.  Plentiful tea coffee and milk for couple on a single night stay.  More could be requested from front desk. Breakfast from 0400 and evening meal good and decent price and choice. Very clean and tidy.  Lovely staff.
191,DevonAdorable,2022-09-30,"Perhaps overpriced but convenient Location close to departure but it is uphill to reach the departure area so for some may be a struggle with a heavy case.
Reception staff pleasant & helpful.
Room clean BUT reception area & dining area needed more attention.  Sadly the carpet was quite stained.
Hot breakfast disappointing, bacon was dry even though breakfast had only just started.
The plus is avoiding driving on the day of departure.
For the price, poor coffee & tea selection in room & no shower cap.
I think it is overpriced for what it offers & when compared with other hotels in the group in similar locations.
Reading this I would put it at 3 out of 5 but give it a 4 because of its location.
HINT if TV says check aerial connection it may be that housekeeping in ‘tidying’ up the wiring have inadvertently pulled out the aerial connection to be found under the shelf on which the TV sits."
192,1234567chris,2022-09-30,"Bring sandwiches, Hotel near airport but not undercover so you will get wet. Food is probably the worst I have experienced and there is no where else to eat, could pick up sandwiches in departures m&s.
I think it Should be called Hilton light"
193,margles51,2022-08-31,"So convenient for Bristol Airport Great hotel, part of a chain but no worse for that. You know what you are getting, and this hotel didn’t disappoint. The hotel is literally a couple of minutes walk from the airport and well signposted. It is quiet, modern and with all the facilities you would expect. Beds are comfortable. Only quibble is it would have been nice to have a low light on in the bathroom overnight for loo trips!
Breakfast was excellent too."

Thanks again to the person who assisted me!

196,MrJT235,2022-08-31,"Quick Airport Stay My dad and I chose to stay at Hampton Inn for an early flight the next day. Checking in took 15 minutes but reception staff were friendly. 

Room was comfortable and clean. We decided to eat at the hotel, ordered our food and waited over an hour to get it (they said 20 minutes wait). In the end it was somewhat good food and the staff apologised for the wait. 

Overall it was an okay stay, but would’ve preferred a bit more organised quick staff."
197,N9-nik-g,2022-07-31,Dishonest cleaners We had two rooms here as flying early in the morning.  Unfortunately my daughter left her very expensive foreo cleansing tool in the bathroom that she’d only just purchased.  Contacted the hotel through Facebook as soon as we landed.  Oh how odd the cleaner didn’t find a thing?!!! Said she would look into it and I’ve never heard back.  Don’t stay here dishonest thief’s as cleaners!
198,ianmS1190DM,2022-08-31,"Flying from Bristol Made the decision to fly internal from Bristol instead of Heathrow staying at Hampton on Hilton. Would advise against this decision —food choice appalling, service fair, crowds in airport with 40 mins in security."
199,odo3680,2022-08-31,"More than just the best location I had to leave my car at Bristol airport for a few days and the flight back was really late so the obvious choice was to book the Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport for the night we landed. I was looking for alternatives because the parking (I chose the multi-storey) and two rooms for a night came at a price. Well let me say I found no viable alternative so am delighted to report that not only is it the best location, but we had a great welcome at check in. We were able to order food and drinks when we arrived and the two twin rooms were great. Perfectly clean and just what we asked for. In fact these were the best beds that we had the pleasure to sleep in during the trip. Breakfast is perfectly adequate and included in the price. We also saw a number of (Alpro) dairy free options so really felt well catered for. All in all it really is the best choice. Oh, and watching the robot vacuum cleaners in the corridor was a real treat!"

No customer service skills or manners on how to treat members 

Told her instantly to cancel my booking to which I already had paid for 

Will never stay at this hotel again or use Hilton , shocking service to what I received in Istanbul at the Hilton bomonti who knew how to treat there members"
201,89carlyw,2022-07-31,"Close to the airport We arrived to a really warm room with defective air conditioning and a tiny fan. We went back to reception to ask to be moved, which they did straight away. It was quiet and comfortable, and when we called from our holiday to ask if they’d found a forgotten kindle, they had it at reception and kindly kept hold of it for two weeks."
202,Tommybang,2022-08-31,Totally worth it Totally worth it if you have an early flight. Just a couple minutes walk from airport.  Quiet and comfy room. Continental breakfast was alright - let us take a bag to take a few bits (fruit & croissants) for the flight. Staff were really friendly and the hotel in general  was nicer than I expected. Decent bar etc and the gym looked really good for a airport hotel

204,KirstyandPaul2019,2022-07-31,"Basic but practical  Mixed feelings regarding this hotel. We stayed as a family, myself, my husband and our 1 and 2 year old. 
We hadn't pre booked parking as the hotel appeared to state you can park there for £8 a night however, this is only if you are staying in the hotel and not for the duration of your holiday, even if upon return you intend to stay in the hotel. Luckily, the man on reception was very warm, welcoming and friendly and explained my error and what was my best option moving forward. 
As for the room itself, the cot bed requested was already prepared in the room and it was a good size with a nice lounger chair and a big bed. The amenities were so very basic and no mini fridge. It was pleasantly quiet and no disruptions to the little ones (some hotels just have no regard for noise control, but this one certainly did) we even had a wave from the window from the man changing the flags which was very nice. There aren't any luggage trolleys within close proximity, for this, you need to go to the airport itself and pay for a trolley and take it to your parked car at the hotels car parking. We then moved the car to the multi storey parking. The hotel and multi storey are in close proximity of each other and a short walk to departures. 

All in all, a nice hotel and basic room, but certainly not what one might expect from a 'Hilton' hotel, it compares more to a Travelodge."
205,pinacolada53,2022-07-31,"Ideal pre early morning flight Very decent hotel doing what Hampton does best. Decent rooms, clean, comfy, decent beds and spare for families. Decent bar and bar food. Great welcoming and helpful staff. A super start to your holiday and only a 5 min walk into the (chaotic) terminal. Glad we stayed the night before our 6am flight. CAn’t go wrong staying here but dont expect a vacation type hotel - this is functional and very good at what it does. Would definitely stay here again."
206,757julief,2022-07-31,"Great stay! Keyless checkin is a dream , so no queuing or hanging around. Room was spotless. Staff were all really pleasant. Food is totally fine for late night, chain hotel standards. Of course it’s not gourmet dining but it was pleasant. 
Delighted to find coffee and a fee breakfast items and 5am!
No complaints at all and an overall great experience For the purpose."
207,PDC1290,2022-07-31,"Poor standards - from checkin to cleanliness I have stayed in this hotel quite a few times on trips in and out of Bristol airport. The reception staff do not even look up to greet incoming clients, look a little scruffy in their appearance, take an inordinate amount of time to checkin, even when prebooked using the HH app, and read out the room numbers out loud when handing over the room card - which I reprimanded one lad for in the name of security risk (he questioned why it was a problem, which indicates they have received no training on customer security and wellbeing).  The rooms are functional, with a tea maker but no bottled water (supposedly offered to Honors clients, but not available apparently), and have a sliding door to either close the bathroom or close the wardrobe but not both! Going to breakfast, one walks past Reception - again where not one staff looks up or volunteers a cheery good morning - through a canteen style dining area to a corner breakfast room which is milling with ground crew staff piling high their plates as breakfast is obviously offered to them.  Overall, this hotel is convenient for late or early flights, but otherwise could not recommend."
208,staceyrB7561AX,2022-07-31,"Super convenient Our room was tiny - we booked a double with a sofa bed and a cot, there was hardly any room to move. 
However, the location and convenience is amazing. A take away breakfast is available (basic but good enough). A few mins walk to the airport. 
Would recommend. It’s expensive but it really is so convenient it’s worth it."
209,r2d21,2022-07-31,"Worst Hampton Experience We stayed at the hotel prior to our departure and again on our return and on both occasions where totally disappointed with our experience.

At check in as Hilton Honors members  we asked for the complimentary water  to be told  they don't do this in Bristol.   Strange how they do in all other Hampton's we have stayed in.

 The seating areas in the lobby and the dining area are very uninviting no comfortable seats apart from just 2 coffee tables with  armchairs close to the main entrance.     

With regards to dining the food menu is limited  poor.  We decided on our pre departure stay to order a portion of potato wedges we where informed that they where not available only french fries.  Having agreed to the alternative when they where served we where then told they had no ketchup what hotel does not have ketchup.  On our second stay one week later we decided in the evening to order the wedges surprise surprise sorry not available only fries.

Moving on to breakfast OK but no where near the standard of other Hampton hotels.  In the breakfast buffet area there are  2 coffee machines on our stay prior to departure one was out of order OK things do brake down.  However, again when we returned one week later the coffee machine was still out of order.  

With regards to cleanliness this again is lacking at breakfast we sat down in the dining area and our plates stuck to the table.  Totally unacceptable.

Having previously stayed in The Hampton at both Liverpool and Stanstead Airports where we'd have no hesitation in returning Bristol was far below what we had expected.  Blaming the current situations is not an acceptable excuse as only this year we have stayed 4 times in Stanstead and have received impeccable service and would recommend the hotel to anyone.  Hampton Bristol unless we had  no option we would not stay there again.  The hotel is way below standard."
210,dogloverkate,2022-07-31,"Pre flight stay We were flying out very early the next morning so to minimise stress we got dropped off her the other side of the barriers.  Checked in & then did the night before bag drop. Highly recommend this as it's carnage in the early morning. Straight thru security & all the shops are open at 4am  

Food at hotel was v poor & the service chaotic. If you come prepared for mediocre you will be fine. Reception team excellent. Lots of rookie staff but that's OK. Well done for working.

Room was fine. Clean. Quiet. Beds comfy. Breakfast grab & go at 4 am  Whoever came up with this. Bravo!

Would we stay here again? Absolutely!"
211,DebrisDoo,2022-06-30,"Chaos - unable to check in til late on  14th June We arrived at around 7pm on Tuesday 14th June so that we would be fresh for our early flight the next morning.

Upon arrival we were told that the IT system was down & they had no record of which rooms had already been allocated & which were free.

We were told to take a seat & someone would be over to talk to us when everything was up and running. As everyone was in the same boat, the queue at the bar was enormous and the servers were going at a snails pace. 

We eventually got our food & drink (which was hot & delicious) and we waited, and we waited. 

We saw that people were once again forming a queue at check in so we guessed that the situation had been resolved - no one had  come round to speak to us & keep us updated. We eventually got into our hotel room just after 10pm. 

We had wanted a really early night as we had to up up again at 3am for our flight - this was an expensive night in a hotel that didn't live up to our expectations at all."
212,Moeatawna,2022-06-30,"Okay Room is ok, could be better.
They stop serving food at 10pm!!!?! 
Breakfast staff are not friendly what so ever .

Rest is ok and can’t fault it. Only used it because of travelling next day. Plus it’s way too expensive for such a standards but what can we do"
213,P3503DGnancym,2022-06-30,Unpleasantly dirty My shower had not been cleaned properly. The breakfast area was dirty. Beer glass rings on the breakfast tables. Ugh! Very expensive for what it is but that's the option if you want to stay at the airport.
214,NickyS876,2022-06-30,"No Fuss Hotel Easy check in. Everywhere was clean and tidy.
Our rooms were a good size, especially the bathroom. 
Dinner was slightly lacking in food and drink options but the breakfast more than made up for it.
Situated close to the airport which is exactly what we wanted, the only issue we had was the £5 fee just to drop off which took less than 5 minutes.
Check out was posting your card.

Fantastic service from all staff, if we fly from Bristol again then we will definitely be staying again."
215,18darrylh,2022-06-30,"Took payment 3 times Me my wife and 4 year old stayed here for 1 night, well it was 5 hours in fact, after a flight home from turkey as didn't fancy driving home on no sleep, the cost was £185.
due to us being delayed coming home they decided to put us down as a no show meaning we got charged £185, but when we checked in they reinstated the booking meaning another £185 was taken but they also decided to take £247 which is there on the day fee, when i spoke to the person on reception she couldn't see why this had happened and couldn't advise me what to do, so i took matters into my own hands and phoned the bank to stop 2 of the payments, on checking out we spoke to the manager who actually was really helpful and even went into the sales team to also reverse the payments, word of advice is basically don't turn up late"
216,tomsX188PK,2022-06-30,"They’re having a laugh! Because of the airport chaos at the moment we decided to book a room for the night we were returning from a holiday in Cyprus as the flight was scheduled to arrive late at night and we planned to drive to our home in the North east the following day. The B&B rate was around £300 which we thought was a bit steep, but we had no choice as there were only a few rooms left. Fortunately my wife had let them know that we might arrive after midnight and the room was available when we eventually arrived (after a 5 hour flight delay and 2.5 hours wait for our luggage) at 4.30 am! Another couple who had not so informed reception found their room had dropped off the system and was no longer available, although after a lot of whispering and shuffling about by the reception staff, they were eventually accommodated. 
The room was quite small but comfortable, although by the time we got in we only had time for a shower, a short rest and breakfast before setting off on the home journey. 
Considering the price, the breakfast was not wonderful. The buffet was OK and offered a fair choice of items, Although the croissants were dry and hard as if they were several days old!
I had expected an airport hotel to be more prepared for people turning up at odd times. Although the reception staff eventually delivered the goods they did seem to be quite taken aback by people turning up several hours late to take up their booked accommodation. The IT system should take some responsibility for this as it appeared that guests who turned up after midnight without prior warning, were automatically removed as “non- shows”
Overall we felt the experience was less than we had expected from Hilton and was expensive for what was on offer."
217,Hazzarch,2022-06-30,"Lovely Little Hotel for The Airport! Me and my fiancé stayed here as we had an early flight the next morning.

We'd never been to a Hilton hotel before so weren't sure what to expect apart from a semi-upper tier hotel.

The man on reception that checked us in was very chatty and made us feel quite comfortable which was great. I had originally setup the remote room key on my phone but had to reset the device before arriving at the hotel, unfortunately it didn't give me permission to use it due to it ""being a different device"" but it wasn't the end of the world.

The room itself was spotless and had very good sound dampening, I don't think we heard a single plane from the outside and not even anyone in the corridor when we were trying to sleep which was very good, when we had to be up at about 3am for a 6.45am flight.

Overall, this hotel was worth the money when I had to drive about an hour and a half to get to the airport, so it prevented us from being worn out and stressed for when our holiday started."
218,RachelS2086,2022-06-30,"Clean, comfortable hotel with fab breakfast choice and good staff The hotel was ideally situated by the airport after a late arrival. Drinks abs a small menu available, we had sandwiches freshly made with a salad and crisps, very tasty. Staff friendly and fun.
The rooms beautifully clean and comfortable with tea and coffee facilities.
The breakfast choice was amazing, all lovely. We had a cooked bree with  juice and coffee, also a Danish pastry on the side, yum!
Great hotel, highly recommend"
219,MrHandBaggageOnly,2022-05-31,"Great For An Early Flight We stayed here for one night before an early flight and had a good stay. This hotel has the standard old style HbH rooms, but they are well soundproofed and we had a decent night’s sleep. 

We appreciated that it is only a five minute walk to the terminal and we also like the fact that although cooked breakfast doesn’t start until later, you can still access some of the continental choice very early in the morning, so you do not miss out totally on breakfast with an early flight.

When we checked in, the bar and restaurant were busy, but we were checked in quickly and efficiently, although it wasn’t overly friendly. The bar area is fine for relaxing, although as with most HbH, the selection of drinks is standard and not very exciting. You are also quite captive here as there is nowhere else to go (other than M&S in the airport terminal).

We will be staying here again soon before another early flight."
220,Gnomie1,2022-06-30,"Hotel and parking We stayed the night as we had an early flight the next morning. We were a little anxious about the airport as it was just as the media were hyping up the queues and chaos. We dropped our car and arrived at the hotel. We were greeted by a really friendly lady on reception who couldn’t have been more helpful. The room was clean, spacious and well kept. We went down to the bar for a bite to eat. The food wasn’t earth shattering but it was tasty, hot and decent portions, a little pricey but to be expected in an airport hotel. The menu is not extensive but we didn’t have any problems with choosing. The restaurant was very busy but the staff were all friendly and smiling! We received a breakfast bag the next morning from the reception desk as we were leaving early. It was ok…….a croissant, a cereal bar, banana and a carton of orange juice. Maybe not the best but certainly enough to take the edge off before our flight and as an ‘on the move’ snack, it did the job. We would certainly consider using the hotel again if we fly out of Bristol. 
We also had silver parking at the airport as part of the package. This was very well organised!(we had read bad reports just before we went so we’re anticipating problems…). You drive in, find a parking space and take note of the bay number. In the office you input your booking, including where you are parked, drop your keys and off you go to the shuttle bus. The staff member who was in there was really friendly and helpful. The shuttle bus runs every 15 mins and within 2-3 mins you are at the airport! The return was just as easy and straightforward."
221,helenwH199DJ,2022-06-30,"Disappointed The first person on reception who  spoke to us was very rude, made us feel really uncomfortable and unwelcome, really bed customer service.
Felt like the money we spent on a nights stay  we would of been made more welcome on arrival.
The evening staff at the bar didn’t have a clue what they were doing and a few people were a bit annoyed with their service.
Breakfast was a take away because of the time we had to leave that was very disappointing.
Will not recommend or be returning.
This was the beginning of our holiday so really glad we were treated a lot better in Lanzarote."
222,haribo2016,2022-06-30,"Good hotel but...... We booked a connecting room, was able to check day before after 6am and apparently choose a room, didn't work no rooms showing not even on day of booking, so made our way to hotel to be pleasantly suprised to have ground floor rooms. Room was clean and spacious. No conditioner in the shower so had to get some from other room. Now dinner, so i ordered a burger whilst i enjoyed the bbq sauce with it i found the burger bland, also it was very over priced for what it was cost over £80 for 4 main meals, 4 drinks (non alcohlic) and 3 deserts. I found the digital keys were annoying and didnt work so requested proper keys. Was suprised to find that they did continental breakfast from 4am so was ideal as thought we would miss breakfast completly. Check out was easy with card deposit box. Would i stay again maybe as was very conveniently located opposite the multi storey car park and not far from the terminal."
223,AbuDhabiHolly,2022-06-30,"Nice Hotel. Pros: Convenient;
a clean, modern, spacious hotel;
Clean and spacious rooms.
Quick check-in.

Con: limited food options, uncomfortable dining area.  The room a/c was temperamental, but it works.

All in all a good hotel for the night before a flight."
224,bigtiddygothmum,2022-06-30,"Feels a bit like extortion I had to stay here because my flight was going at 6am and I needed to be at the airport early with my two children. This meant we had to be up at 3am and as a result it was very important we got a good night's sleep as soon as possible. We arrived around 8.40pm and another customer told me there had been an issue with ""the system"" and no-one had been checked in for hours. Thankfully people did start getting checked in shortly after we arrived but of course there was a backlog. After travelling by train and bus to get here with two small children they were in no mood to be patient and wrangling them during the wait was trying. One of the receptionists did get my children a glass of water each for which I was thankful, but apart from that there was not even acknowledgement or apology for the situation they were in let alone any kind of compensation for a room that had cost over £200 for what would in the end be 7hrs of total occupancy. 

The room itself was fairly standard for what you'd expect at a chain hotel, if I'd have stayed longer I'd be disappointed at the lack of bath but I wasn't going to have time for that anyway. My children took the double bed and I took the sofa bed and I regret the choice, the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable for an adult, but might be fine for a child. 

I get that a hotel like this can survive fine on the convenience of it's location but I don't think it does the brand much good as a whole that it was overall just a really mediocre experience. I've never stayed at a Hampton before but it doesn't make me feel like I'd choose it over a different option and certainly not a cheaper one of the budget chains."
225,Lindylou146,2022-06-30,"Ok for the airport A little confusing at the entrance to the hotel car park as we only wanted do a drop off before parking in the multi storey car park . We thought there was a charge as there were barriers but apparently you can drive in and get your ticket validated at the desk for one hour free. There was a long queue at check in which seemed to take ages. But the girl was pleasant and friendly and explained everything. Our rooms were together as requested and they all had sofa beds made up although we didn’t need them in all rooms. It was certainly adequate for one night before flying and even had a safe. Soap and shampoo pumps were provided in the bathroom and there was a hairdryer. Tea and coffee also. The bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable and was too close to the bathroom wall on one side so making it difficult for my husband to get in and out of bed ! The room was quiet until people started moving between 3-4 am. 
We had an evening meal which was served fairly quickly considering it was busy and the food was just ok. My husband found the cheese and ham panini rather dry and boring but it was served with a salad and chips. My chicken tikka was nice but had a soggy popadom . There were quite a few other choices including jacket potatoes and burgers. 
We didn’t hang around over breakfast as we had to get over to the airport which was about a ten minute walk away through an undercover walkway which only lasted a short distance so not so good if raining! In all it served a purpose but not cheap for one night at £152!"
226,Irmani,2022-06-30,"Lovely staff, comfortable rooms We arrived on a late flight from Portugal with a particular room booked which we had done through a third party booking service (queen). The hotel was clearly very busy and we were put into a room with twin double beds. This was not ideal and we asked the receptionist if it was possible to have the room we had booked. She moved us to a much nicer room (same footprint but better layout which meant I could share a bed with my husband!).

This was a real 5/5 from us because despite an initial problem the really kind and professional receptionist went out of her way to fix it, and also comped us a couple of drinks which was unexpected and massively appreciated. It has made me much more likely to choose this chain again, knowing that a small hiccup will be dealt with nicely. 

Great staff. Room was comfortable and well proportioned and I like the fact that the toiletries are in dispensers so less plastic waste! The bar was lovely as well with really nice common areas to relax. Late night bar staff were charming and friendly. Well done Hilton!"
227,vickibaines,2022-06-30,"Disappointing stay at this hotel Expensive microwaved food which was tasteless

228,WorldIsLobster,2022-06-30,"Fine, nice, comfortable Was there for a matter of hours as very early flight. But new/modern hotel, comfortable, staff nice, a 4-5 minute walk from the terminal so can drop car off and just walk it. If Jet2 suggest use twilight check in for bags so don’t have to queue but make sure to keep what you need for the morning. Will do again if at Bri."
229,jezzapalarm,2022-06-30,"Lovely airport hotel and staff. Minuscule portions and expensive food Lovely hotel and staff. Really clean too. Hotel food are restaurant prices, but not restaurant quality. I am an average build, but had to order 2x meals of chilli con carne and 2 baked potatoes. The double portion of chilli con carne was minuscule and I complained. In fairness another portion was brought out to me at no additional cost. I ordered a pint of beer and onion rings too. Please be aware that my extra portion of chilli con carne came in a 11 x 5 cm ram-akin dish which is less than 300 ml of sauce and meat. My overall bill was £28.13. I begrudge having to pay for two meals and I don’t feel like I have eaten well. The chef, who was very polite ,informed me that the portion sizes are not determined by him. In future I feel like eating before staying the night before a flight at this hotel. I am a Hilton Diamond member too. Overall I do not feel that I have received good value for money, but that Hilton is trying to recoup the money lost during the COVID lockdown. I am very disappointed."
230,E8076JPben,2022-06-30,"Ideal for the night before an early flight Clean hotel, modern amenities. Although they do serve food don’t expect restaurant quality but for what it is it’s okay. Although we booked for parking there was very limited spaces but we managed to get the last one. Great for a night before flying."
231,262benw,2022-06-30,Stop over before early morning flight Very clean hotel. Great location for early flights. On arrival there was no where to park in the hotels car park. Even Tho I had pre booked it. Once we had found a parking space we then went to check In. They had already check someone with the same surname into my booking so I ended up with his booking. Other than that food was pretty much average nothing special. We opted for the breakfast bag in the morning which was ok for on the go. Overall if you have an early flight would definitely recommend staying he just for the easy. And it’s literally 5 minutes from the terminal
232,BecciGlos,2022-06-30,"Excellent stress free night before flying We had a warm welcome and checked in easily (3pm). Rooms nice - clean, fresh and made up with an extra bed for our daughter. They had made a real effort for the jubilee and there were lots of decorations etc which were a nice touch. We did the Jet2 twilight bag drop (very handy and hotel a v short walk to terminal) then came back for a drink. Drinks good but food a little poor. Average prices, quick service. Soundproofing must be fantastic as we didn’t hear anything. We had to leave at 3am but they had prepared breakfast bags which was a nice touch and we had wake up calls etc. Staff all really friendly and working hard - thank you. I would definitely stay here again."
233,ElCowboy2008,2022-05-31,"Awful. Don’t be fooled by the name ‘Hilton’ Very overpriced , very poor customer service, very expensive and poor restaurant.

Arrived late on a Saturday afternoon. Went to our room to discover the room had not even been cleaned, the bed was left as it was from the previous guests their bed sheets left on the floor. The cleaners who were wondering aimlessly around the corridor didn’t seem to be at all interested in our complaint and were passing the blame onto each other before continuing to chat among themselves doing as little as possible which seems to be what they’re best at. 
We went to reception to be given another room, no help moving our luggage or even a gesture to compensate  such as a free drink or a meal but then we remembered where we were. Hampton by Hilton which is a euphemism for abysmal customer service. Don’t be fooled by the name “Hilton” this is a no frills hotel at premium prices trying to be something that it isn’t. On that day we also enjoyed the pleasure of no running water for quite a while unable to flush toilets, wash or have a drink for some time. Thankfully running water was restored later. 
The rooms have showers but there’s no proper shower door so very soon shower/ toilet room floor becomes like a lake flooded with splashed water! 

Food. The restaurant is more like a canteen only cold and not very comfortable. No table service or welcoming waiters, instead you queue up for highly over priced snacks on a very limited menu. Over £15 for a starter consisting of little chicken bits, chips and a pint of beer! Again providing as little as possible for very high prices. You’re better off eating before you arrive or bringing a packed lunch!
We had a very early flight and normally they should provide bags for a take away breakfast. Breakfast is included in the price but they ran out of bags so we did without which is obviously a great help to this place as they save food which helps with their mission to do as little as possible for very high prices. So we left hungry to venture into the bedlam of Bristol airport with its  chaos and infamously long queues. 

The only good thing is it’s relative proximity to the airport but that’s about all. Not worth the money! 

Seriously do not be fooled by the name ‘Hilton’ this place is the pits!"
234,tirol94,2022-06-30,"Convenient Don’t be fooled by the name Hilton We stayed overnight at this hotel because of an early flight the next morning.
The only good thing about this hotel is the convenience being on the airport. Unfortunately, it stops there. Don’t be fooled by the name ‘Hilton’
We arrived at approx. 4pm we had 2 rooms booked, I asked about breakfast the next morning because of our early departure, I was told to collect a breakfast bag from reception the following morning.

We arrived into our rooms and ours hadn’t been made it up, it was disgusting.  I went into the corridor and there were about 4 housekeeping staff doing nothing, 
I mentioned the room to them, they just shrugged and didn’t appear interested.  Then they started arguing who should make up the room.
I went to reception and waited about 5 minutes for a receptionist to appear.  She came out of a back office and wasn’t as professional as one would expect she appeared to have just eaten.
I told her about the room,  and the staff arguing, she apologised and decided we should change rooms., at the same time my daughter booked into the next room told reception she had no water at all .  The receptionist apologised and said we should both move rooms, from 1st to 2nd floor.  She gave us new rooms and we had the inconvenience of moving our belongings a floor up, with no offer of help.  We arrived in the new rooms and the sofa bed was not made up!  in addition my daughter needed a cot, someone had to bring a cot and was just dumped in the room.

We had a snack in the restaurant during the evening but had to leave as soon as we had finished because it was so cold we were most uncomfortable, other customers had their coats on.  I understand the need for ventilation, but this was an arctic blast blowing.

The next morning, the breakfast buffet was set up and we went for bags to put the food in,  receptionist told us none left sorry.  I asked what were we supposed to put the food in? she said plenty of seats take a tray  and sit down.  I explained we needed to get to the airport early because of the situation, which is why we need bags.  She said again take a tray and sit down.  She just didn’t understand the situation.  That was that we had no breakfast.

I would not recommend this hotel, we paid £400 for 2 rooms with shocking service and no breakfast, the hotel appears to be running on a shoe string and charging extortionate prices.

For future early flights we shall use a taxi return from Newton Abbot."
235,SazzyP79,2022-05-31,"Noisy and disorganised Positives - staff we met were lovely, location is excellent, very short walk to departures. 

Unfortunately lots of negatives - 

I had emailed the hotel on booking to request rooms next to each other due to us having fairly young children. I received an email back to confirm that the rooms had been pre allocated close together. On arrival, the receptionist clearly had no idea of this agreement, it wasn’t on my booking notes and the rooms that we were given (all that was left) were at opposite ends of the corridor.

The restaurant was very busy and we had to queue for at least 15 minutes each time we wanted a drink and to order food. We waited over an hour for our food which was very average.

The hotel was incredibly noisy and we hardly slept. I appreciate that this is an airport hotel and guests have flights throughout the night to get up for but the walls seemed to be paper thin and we could hear every movement. We also received 3 ‘knock and run’ visits from teenagers running up and down the corridors. 

I had also emailed prior to my visit to ask about parking. I was told to consult the airport website. The airport website did not show the hotel car park as available so I ended up booking a car park further away on the airport site. When we arrived, we realised that it is possible to turn up and pay at the hotel car park which would have been a much better option for us. I’m not sure why this information couldn’t have been shared when I emailed to ask."
236,eddieedwards29,2022-05-31,Convenient and clean  Lovely clean and spacious rooms. Was disappointed in the food quality and options considering there was much around ten airport site and couldn't just pop out. Breakfast was so much better though which I enjoyed. The room was great but had to ring downstairs to ask for another pillow as only 1 soft pillow was provided for each of us. A little surprised at the car parking fee considering the room price as was only there for less then 24 hours.
237,Silk44w,2022-05-31,By far and away my best stay of my trip! The staff were always willing to answer questions you had. The breakfast and dinner were lovely. A marked improvement on the last time I stayed! Slept very well overnight in a bed I hadn’t tried before which is unusual for me!
238,Iankb66,2022-06-30,"Ridiculous car park Here’s the problem with this hotel; parking! I din’t imagine anyone comes here by foot, and even anyone flying in would probably hire a car, so when we arrived and there wasn’t a parking space I was surprised. Moreover, the car park is designed so you can only drive through and out again. Having found that there wasn’t a parking space, it demanded £5 to allow us to look again. I went to Reception to remedy this, and predictably on my return there was an angry motorist behind me. Which meant - Ah! - a parking space. But this oversight, and the demand for a fiver merely for looking for a space, are unforgivable. 

Aside from that the hotel is clean and spacious, and the staff were courteous. But typically for an hotel of this class, the shower was a triumph of style over function. The low wall of the shower tray is way too low to accommodate the water it’s supposed to contain, so necessarily a shower of normal length floods the bathroom. 

It’s convenient for an early flight, and for that I’d stay here again."
239,delighted05,2022-05-31,A great place the night before traveling This is an excellent place to stay the night before your travel.  Breakfast is served at 4.00 am for a continental one and a full cooked English breakfast from 6.00 am. these are both buffet style and you can eat as much as suits you.

The shower tray flooded, the bedside draw was broken, the glassware were dirty, the picture above the bed had a large amount of dust. The room didn’t really look like the hotels professional photos and reminded me of something from a flat pack furniture store.   This is not what I expected from the Hilton brand. On departure at 4am the receptionist just waved and said nothing else. It’s a shame I have another booking for August, I’d never have booked here again if I’d known how below standard it is for an expensive price. Let’s hope by August the rooms are cleaner!"
243,iand916,2022-05-31,"Nice clean hotel menu lets it down Use the hotel regularly for early flights always clean comfy rooms. The only let down is its restaurant. Its more if a cafeteria, the menu is is extremely limited burgers pizza etc Not long ago they used to have specialist pies on menu which were really good these are no longer available. Bristol airport is not a place you would chose to stay it would be nice to have a nice dining enviroment and menu for your preflight stay"
244,Andylaughton,2022-05-31,Dick turpin £158 for a few hours before a flight. In a queue with 20 other people just to order food which when served was of poor quality and clearly microwaved🤮the hotel is ideal for the airport but no excuse to charge such prices
245,alesZ476ZW,2022-05-31,"Nice and simple stay near Bristol Airport Simple and lovely hotel near the airport. Friendly staff and clean rooms. Breakfast was lovely and varied. We arrived quite late, around 11p.m. And the receptionist was friendly and very helpful. Slept like a baby in the room. Did not understand why there was a second bed made in the room, but that was no problem!"
246,502hilaryd,2022-04-30,"Overpriced and very basic for the price Very disappointed in this airport hotel.  Not a patch on the Heathrow and Gatwick Airport hotels.  Two tiny pillows, one of which had a stain on the pillowcase, no fridge, cracked mug, one tiny hook in the bathroom to hang 2 bath and 2 hand towels.  Impossible.  It was like they were getting away with the minimum and blow any feeling of luxury.  With the nightmare of Bristol airport first thing the next morning, it would have been nice to feel treated well before.  Staff, however, excellent."
247,ExeterChris,2022-05-31,"Does the job We stayed for 1 night prior to an early flight.
Checking in and out was OK. You have to queue at the bar for drinks and food which was a little painful. The food we ate was OK but no better.
Our room was well equipped with a nice bathroom. The bed was a little small and tucked into the corner of the room which made getting into one side tricky.
All areas of the hotel were very clean.
I'd stay again for an early flight but not if I was visiting Bristol generally"
248,Trek08240083404,2022-05-31,Avoid online check in Awful check in process - avoid checking online through their app to get a digital key. It messes everything up for the customer and for the front desk/reception staff. What should have been a straight forward action it turned out to be a waste of time for everyone involved
249,3anita,2022-04-30,Could be better We were pleased with the reception area and food on offer but on entering the room felt disappointed. The room had been arranged so one side of the bed was very close to the wall although the room was of a reasonable size. This made it difficult for my husband to get in and out of bed easily. There were only two pillows which is unusual on a king size bed and no decaf coffee or tea. The reason for only three stars is the early morning call at 3.30a.m did not happen! The receptionist had specifically asked if we wanted a call. Fortunately I had set my phone to wake us up or we would have missed our flight.
250,L5915CEjulieb,2022-04-30,"It was ok for one night We booked in order to be at the airport the night before our morning flight - just in case there were traffic delays on the day.
The room and public areas were clean and the amenities were satisfactory.
Breakfast was dire.  Everything from fruit to cutlery had run out and was not being replenished.  Customers were having to ask for cutlery and then it would appear and it was not busy.  I'm guessing we arrived after the early morning busy period but, even so, I would have thought that during the lull in which we and a few other guests arrived in we would have witnessed a hive of activity in replenishing the basics.  This didn't happen.
The reception desk was devoid of staff when we went to validate our parking ticket.  A member of staff went in search but was unsuccessful.  
It just wasn't the sort of experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel.
Next time, I think we'll try staying somewhere about 15 minutes down the road."
251,ejp1968,2022-04-30,"No early check-ins available at Hilton Hotels I have stayed in a few Hilton Hotels recently and they appear to have developed a strict early check in possibility. Pre-Covid, if you arrived an early and a room was available you would be able to check in. In big city and airport hotels this was never an issue. Hotels are not booked to full capacity currently and there was always one room available. Today I arrived at the Hampton by Hilton Hotel Bristol Airport at 10am due to a flight connection. The hotel is absolutely dead- you can see by the passenger traffic in the lobby. I was told by the receptionist that despite being a Gold member and despite having called ahead before making the reservation where I was told early check in would be determined on the day, that Hilton do not allow any check ins before 12 pm, even if they have rooms available. This is not the policy of many other chain hotels and I would encourage you to stay elsewhere if you need an early check in. 
I am checking out at 4am and so tomorrow, I hope someone is more fortunate than I am."
252,Dave_T999,2022-03-31,Great overnight stay. We stayed here for one night as our flight back from the Canaries was really late and we didn't want to drive home too tired. We had fairly low expectations to be honest as some people we met at the airport stayed here and said it was terrible. We were pleasantly surprised though. Check in was quick and easy. The room was great and we had a really nice breakfast the following morning. Could not fault it. We will definitely stay here again.
253,simonpZ4140MY,2022-04-30,"Fantastic Customer Service After being let down by EasyJet we had to rearrange our flights. 
Ebony on the hotel reception has been most helpful providing support to us with IT and arranging cups of tea.
All staff were wearing facemasks which was a delight to see given the rates of COVID in the area.
Would strongly recommend staying at the Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport."
254,WasherBottle,2022-03-31,Never again! Food offering in the evening and breakfast extremely limited and poor. I walked over to M & S in the Airport for a salad for my dinner as there was nothing remotely tempting on the menu. Dreadful nights sleep due to the bed being as hard as a board as were the pillows. This is a budget hotel of poor standard that is vastly over priced.
255,meinirann,2022-03-31,"Takes the stress out of solo travel The hotel is in the perfect location. Right by the airport and the bus station. An airport bus took me up there from Temple Meads station. I stayed as I had an early flight at 7.15am, and I was too nervous to drive, so I took the train, but of course there were no trains at that time of the morning, so I decided to stay the night. The hotel is a comfortable, peaceful city style hotel. It has all the amenities needed for a quick overnight stop. There’s a bar and a restaurant. There isn’t a great choice on the menu, but it does the job - something to keep you going until you reach your holiday destination. I had a burger with chips, and it certainly filled me up. The only negative really was the wake up call. I requested a 4.30am wake up call, but received a 3.30am wake up call. I couldn’t get back to sleep then, not that there would have been much point as I would have had less than an hour before I needed to get up, so I just decided to have a cuppa using the facilities in the room, and headed over to the airport a little earlier than planned. I will stay here again next time I fly from Bristol airport early."
256,jordansT9200LM,2022-03-31,"10/10 Good food, good vibes and friendly staff. Not too far from airport. Recommend highly especially the bar as lots of choice and some staff went above and beyond for us. Very limited children's menu however. Good staff."
257,lornasO4216HS,2022-03-31,"Brilliant service Very warm welcome ,quick service.  rooms are spotlessly clean, special mention of Ebony. She was cheerful , pleasant and professional . All other staff were friendly and service was excellent. Decent rates for 1 night ."
258,Penarthgymreviewer,2022-03-31,"Night before flight Stayed for one night with my husband before our flight from Bristol Airport. 
We booked a hotel and car parking package through the official airport website which was a good deal - including parking in the hotel car park. Very convenient. 
Slight communication issue on arrival, but this was quickly resolved. 
Clean room on first floor. Very comfortable bed and good power shower. 
We used the gym - open 24/7 which is ideal. Was empty, apart from us. (See photos of equipment. The same as all other Hampton hotels.)
Evening meal choice was limited, but we did find something to suit us both. 
Excellent self-service breakfast included in the price which is a bonus. 
Have used the hotel before and would do so again."
259,antj111,2022-02-28,"Family holiday Stayed here in February before flying to lanzarote , hotel is a 5 min walk away from the airport so very convenient !  I booked 3 rooms as there was 9 of us going away ( 3 children ) .On arrival rooms weren't quite ready even tho it was 3 o clock when we arrived , it wasn't a problem as we just went to the bar for a drink ! Bar service was quick and staff very friendly.  Receptionist came over with our keys when all 3 rooms were ready so no queuing to check in ! Rooms were comfortable and bed settees were all made up in each room for the children ! We ordered an evening meal which was lovely and service was quick ! Continental Breakfast was served from 4 which was ideal as we needed to be in airport by 6am , hot breakfasts aren't served till 6am ! Breakfast was adequate , crossionts,  toast , cereal coffee it was very busy ! Would definitely stay here again , can't fault the hotel and staff were are very helpful and friendly"
260,JamieR161,2022-03-31,"Ultra convenient Super convenient for flying from Bristol - could not be easier.  Room was spotless and pillow great. Bed comfortable, if a trifle hard. Very quiet, despite being so close to the airport.   Food was tasty and hot. Breakfast plentiful and convenient.  Parking was a bit expensive and the rates need to be a lot clearer on the website - it's all a bit confusing.  What we ended up paying was similar to using one of the airport car parks though.  We found Ebony, who checked us in. to be really helpful, patient and friendly.  She took time to help us with procedures to get to the terminal, etc. and this was greatly appreciated. Thanks to her.
Overall, would definitely use again."
261,whohasthis,2022-02-28,"Purposely misleading parking signage - You can park in the paid parking area. Read the small print You can use the parking outside the hotel for guest unloading. Do not get fined like me.

Unfortunately the hotel is let down by the parking which is not managed by them but significantly impacted my stay.  There is a parking area outside the hotel however the display indicates that you have to pay about £5 for 0-2 hours (extortionate for a 5 min drop off) or something like that.  My father dropped me off just outside the parking barrier which took less than a minute but there is no stoping on all roads near the hotel so was fined.  
There is apparently 5min stoping allowed to drop off hotel guests in the parking area however this is not clearly displayed and I find it deceitful that it is not clearly displayed.  I think this happens to guests regularly as the staff were not surprised by what happened and informed me that the airport manages the parking.  Apparently in the second paragraph it says you can drop off guests (not on the fee information)  and they had requested that the signage be clearer but the airport had not done this.  I think it is a purposeful set up to fine as many people as possible to create revenue.  The car with the camera was there in seconds so I guess they wait nearby for people to make the same mistake over and over again at £60 a go!

If the signage would have been clear we would have used the parking and could have said good bye properly. This would have been much more preferable!

However the hotel was nice, basic but clean and I would stay again. The parking situation however has left a bad feeling so will be avoiding Bristol airport when possible!  Unfortunately the parking situation that is not in their control negatively affects my opinion."
262,1468VX,2022-03-31,"Great location Right next to the main terminal. Very modern, clean and comfortable. Has restaurant serving food from 4am. Nice bar area. We knew there was parking but thought it would be free to residents, however a special £8 overnight rate not too bad. We live 1.5 hours from the airport so will always use this for early morning flights now. A great place to stay."
263,Q2149EQnickm,2022-03-31,"Like eating in a motorway service area… only worse The rooms are adequate but please look to eat somewhere else before you arrive at this place. 

Our meal was a worse experience than sitting in a motorway service area. 

The food was ultra bland but eclipsed by the SkySports football commentary being played to the entire restaurant by the occupants of a nearby table who cried out with the crudest of four letter language at every refereeing decision or offside. 

It was mentioned to staff but nothing was done about it. 

We will try somewhere else for our airport stay next time."
264,Sammythesmiler,2022-02-28,"Nice to see they have taken feedback onboard We stayed in this hotel in November 2021 and found it disappointing in some ways. We contacted the hotel who were quick to find out the issues and rectify them.

We came back again in February 2022 and had a better stay. The room was comfortable, the second bed was made up and they were quick to deal with any requests we had. The only issue we had was we had a room was near the bus station so it was quite noisy but I think that is just luck for which room you get.

the food is quite expensive here but it is nice and hot. We had pizzas and it is good to see they changed their supplier back to the old one. It was also an added bonus that you can get cooked breakfast from 6am now too.

The staff were friendly and they will do anything to help you. I would definitely visit again."
265,julians696,2022-02-28,"Nice hotel. Shame about the check out. This is a standard 'Hampton by Hilton' so anyone familiar with the brand, will know exactly what to expect.

Check in went smoothly, dinner was OK, my bed was very comfortable and breakfast was standard  Hampton.

The only disappointment was on checkout. The woman behind the desk (morning shift 24/02) appeared to regard customers as a HUGE inconvenience. I asked her to call me a taxi and she behaved as if this was an unreasonable request and when I asked for a paper copy of the bill, she reacted as if I had asked for something so out of the ordinary, she could barely believe it.

If I ran this hotel, I would probably find her a different job, where she would feel less inconvenienced by the customers whose money pays here wages."
266,I7972QWdavidw,2022-02-28,"Great start to the holiday We chose to stay over at the airport prior to our holiday.  We had a lengthy flight ahead (six hours) and a significant commute (four hours) from home.  Accordingly, to minimise stress and give the holiday a good start, we chose to sleep at the airport on the night before departure.  We chose this hotel because it allowed parking for the duration of the holiday, at an extra cost, actually on the aiport estate.  We could then walk to the terminal.  Mobility impaired dedicated parking is available and the hotel has step free access.  Our room was located upstairs (via lift) along a carpeted corridor.  Our window looked out onto the multi-storey car park.  The cost of our stay included breakfast, with a 'continental' option available from 0400 and the 'Full English' from 0600.  Our flight departure time enabled us to partake of the full English option and it didn't disappoint.  We found that a nice touch was the availability of ""to go"" coffee cups and the opportunity to ""take away"" croissants and pastries.  We took the pastries onto the aircraft saving the exorbitant, sky high even, cost of in-flight food.  Access from the hotel to the terminal is from the ground floor, via a covered walkway which is auto-illuminated, leading to steps/ramp to a Zebra-crossing and then further steps/ramp to a further Zebra-crossing leading to the arrivals door.  Our only negative was a slow draining shower tray - ""Mr Muscle"" could probably assist - but this isn't enough to downgrade the overall rating.  All staff were very helpful and mindful of covid restrictions.  Signage from the main A38 was excellent and we arrived into the hotel car park without mishap.  The barrier gave us a ticket, which when inserted on departure worked perfectly.  We were very happy with our stay.  We had a comfortable, quiet night.  Just a five minute walk to the terminal and a good start to our sunshine break.

267,jamescG6945ZX,2022-02-28,"Excellent service and location Fairly new hotel, excellent staff, easy access, parking right outside. Clean comfortable room, bed with only one pillow each, I should have ask for another but when you realise at 4.00 am who really cares ! Other than that cracking hotel, good breakfast etc all a bit no frills but that’s what you expect from this brand at a location like this. Perfect in almost every way. Oh and it’s quiet despite the location right next to the airport."
268,wtfdtsf,2022-01-31,"Truly awful food Modern hotel within easy walking distance of the terminal. Rooms were comfortable and well-equipped, and the staff were fine. It is really let down by the restaurant, however, which is the only place to eat anywhere near. The limited choice of food for dinner was either deep-fried or microwaved and of very poor quality."
269,damienrQ9510RD,2022-01-31,"Uncomfortable avoid! This hotel, unfortunately the only one at Bristol Airport, is at best a Motel. 
Trays for your breakfast which you stack up when finished, food is poor and selection is limited. Poached eggs aren’t even an option at breakfast. They apparently would take too long for them to cook.
The coffee machine; I selected hot water and brown gunk came out. 
If you have to leave early the continental breakfast is poor or not available as there’s no kitchen staff working until later on. 
The Evening food selection is no better. 
The beds are super uncomfortable as are the pillows. Both very hard.  What you would think was like sleeping on a mortuary slab. 
They offer no real solutions other than putting another quilt under the sheets. So obviously a fairly common complaint."
270,NudeMark,2022-01-31,Excellent airport hotel We stayed overnight at the hotel prior to an early morning flight. Covid preparations were in order and the hotel staff were very helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. We ate dinner which was acceptable at the price point. We did not take advantage of the complimentary breakfast as we were flying at 6am.
271,H2038TDkerrya,2022-01-31,"Drop off charge A friend dropped us at the hotel,£5.00 to drop someone off,ABSOLUTE DISGRACE...how do they justify it?....they don't have to.They also threaten to fine you a hundred pounds if you stop outside the car park,hotel is OK but won't be staying again."
272,Meander785104,2022-01-31,"Excellent Location. Great breakfast, disappointing evening meal. The hotel wins hands down on location and the airport itself is accessible on foot, although it could be unpleasant if raining as there is no covered walkway.
The rooms are modern and well equipped. The evening meal was very disappointing. Chose a special of Lamb shank which was accompanied by frozen vegetables which were just barely defrosted. The atmosphere is more akin to a waiting room with regular blasts of cold air from the automatic opening doors.
On the other hand the breakfast buffet was generous and full of variety. Self service was a little tricky with the reccomendation  to use the trays,  but nowhere to place them while collecting the items."
273,sspxb17,2022-01-31,"A perfect start to your holiday. We have avoided this place in the past due to high cost but got a good deal at £80, I am now hooked and will gladly pay more. The rooms are spacious and well equipped, its position is ideal for travel, the staff are so polite and professional. I'm not a big eater prior to flying so had the soup which was delicious and piping hot, the cost of meals were very reasonable as were the drinks.
From now on everything I fly I shall here for the perfect start to my holiday, if its your thing they even serve breakfast from 4.00 am.
Good job you should be very proud."
274,KandKxxx,2021-12-31,"Great location - but the evening meal was so disappointing Great location - within walking distance of departures. 
Check in was prompt and effecient.  
Room was clean and had everything you could need, but we found the sheets a bit scratchy (too much starch perhaps..).
The breakfast buffet was great, with a good selection of quality food. 
BUT - the evening meal was horrible.  The burger was dry and bland, and the pasta was dry, bland and did not come with any cheese.  I felt ashamed that this could be a foreigners first experience of english cusine."
275,kedw1260,2021-12-31,"So much easier for an early flight With a 6am take off and a 2 hr drive to get to the airport we decided that an airport hotel would be a much better option.     The Hampton by Hilton at Bristol fitted the bill perfectly. 

The location was ideal and only a 5 minute walk in the morning.  The room was warm and clean, all staff very welcoming and the breakfast was plentiful and very good.   Only disappointment was that because we had such an early flight we missed out on a cooked breakfast (will have to make sure we fly later next time). 

Will definitely stay again - our holidays will now start an evening early at this hotel."
276,LurcherLover40,2021-12-31,"Perfect  We stayed here for out trip out and return. 
It was super and we've booked for next year.
The reception was prompt, friendly and professional. 
The bar area comfortable. 
The rooms spacious and clean.
The best thing is parking the car, walking up to the hotel and you're relaxed!
No worries of travelling, being delayed as you're at the airport...
The walk with cases is easy and took 2 minutes...
We can't fault it..."
277,martichaele,2021-12-31,Cleaning should be improved The room was quite spacious. However the cleaning was poor- there were toenails on the carpet and body hair in the shower. Wifi was weak. No room service provided even if covid restrictions have been lifted for months. Would not recommend

280,MichaelScogley,2021-11-30,Nice and convenient Very convenient for the airport.  Right between the terminal and longstay carpark.  Clean and comfortable rooms with a good bar to relax in.  Breakfast was good too.  The price for a night plus 2 weeks parking wasn't much more than the parking alone either.
281,RayH301,2021-12-31,"Relaxing way to start a holiday On arrival it was very easy to park at the hotel and check into a our room. You get free parking for an hour in the hotel carpark, we then moved the car into the long stay car park which has a 2nd entrance opposite the hotel. 

We were pleased to book this hotel. Our flight was due to take off at 7am so we set the alarm for 5am but we awoke to news that the flight had a 9 hour delay! Phoned reception, check out was extended to 12 noon and back to sleep. 

Breakfast was very good with a decent selection that would suit most people. We then relaxed in the comfort of the lounge/bar which was much better than the airport. 

Staff were very helpful and efficient and the room/bed was very comfortable and quiet. 

We’ll be using this one again."
282,Allovertheplace2013,2021-11-30,"Overnight arrivals... I regularly fly into BRS on the last flight on a Sunday night and miss car rental as its closed by 10pm.  Its a ""no fuss"" hotel and I use the digital check-in, so no need to even bother stopping at Reception.

The rooms are all the same, ""cookie cutter"" rooms - bland, clean, sterile, functional. The rooms are always fine, though sometimes, hot, sometimes rather cool.... If the air-con is off, it does take some time for it to switch modes, so don't go mad waiting for the transition. 

Breakfast is basic: juices (blended if its orange and its very average); the usual cereals, tea, coffee, etc. and included in the price.  Not a lot of atmosphere, but it does fulfill its purpose. I will keep using it."
283,W8404GAmichaelc,2021-11-30,"Great Hotel if you seriously don't enjoy food! It should be classified as a motel. Living just an hour from this relatively new hotel, with the prospect of an early start for a flight to the sunny Canary Islands, we thought it looked like a good idea.  The hotel is convenient to the airport and parking was easy.  Reception was pleasant and the room was nice.  All looked good until we wanted to have a relaxing meal.  Oh my god what a mistake it proved to stay here.  The list of options, you could not call it a menu, was made up of the most basic items that could be heated in a microwave or thrown in a fryer. My burger was acceptable but with almost no vegie items for my wife she chose a jacket potato and what sounded a bit like isso misso, a seafood selection.  The jacket potato was uncooked and hard and the seafood selection turned out to be 6 calamari rings with half a plate of chopped salad with brown sauce liberally sprayed all over it. These dishes were sent back and my wife with no other edibal options went to bed without any food. The staff admitted they should have a better offering but the management will not give approval."
284,PugslejanetdV5516NN,2021-11-30,"One night pre flight stay Very impressed with this hotel.  Check in simple and reception staff exceptionally friendly.  I was travelling on my own, so I asked if there was room service and although there wasn't, you could order at the bar and ask for it to be put on a tray to take up to your room, however I decided to try the bar and didn't feel uncomfortable at all sitting there on my own. 
You ordered at the bar and they brought it to your table.  Menu was quite small but what I had was very enjoyable, freshly cooked and hot. All payments were taken by card (no cash) at the time of ordering.
Room comfortable with the usual tea/coffee etc, hairdryer.  Wake up call booked and received. 
Walk to the airport the next morning was quick, no more than 5 minutes and you could take a ramp or steps so suitable for everyone.
I would definitely stay again if I were to fly out of Bristol Airport."
285,VoyageVogage123,2021-11-30,"Felt like 4 star Stayed here to avoid an early flight over for my daughter’s Hen do starting the next day. Room with sofa bed & footstool was super clean (well done to the Housekeeping team) and very comfortable, with plenty of space and even a desk with office type chair.
The bar/restaurant area is well set out. Enjoyed a drink with friends in the evening, with a good atmosphere. Breakfast the next morning was something to look forward to - usual hot selection (eggs, bacon, sausages etc) as well as cereals, fruit (grapefruit very good), selection of breads & pastries and even a waffle machine. There was a press button coffee machine & selection of fruit teas too.
Hotel is right at the airport, you just follow the signs, cross the road and walk directly to it under a covered walkway. It is geared up for guests getting flights, with useful monitors in the seating areas displaying live flight arrivals & departures.
Check out is 11, but no problem hanging around in the seating areas to wait for flights/people arriving.
Covid safety measures have all been thought through and implemented and I found the staff to be friendly and efficient. The reception guy kindly rejigged my booking so that I could check in earlier, as soon as I arrived, and changed my room from a twin to a double, which I appreciated. I’m sorry I didn’t get his name, but I checked in at around 2.30pm. He provided excellent customer service, and deserves a mention.
All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It’s around £100 per night for 2 people (depending on when you book) including breakfast, so not budget end, but it gave me a relaxing start to the Hen weekend."

287,JV1966Dub,2021-11-30,"Please improve  your food offering A great hotel in many respects. Good clean rooms and on the door step of Bristol Airport. I've stayed here a few times now and it's big failing is it's food and drink offer. A limited, very average menu, more akin to a Mway Service Station, canteen style. But not cheap. As an example, the food is delivered to your table and you then have to go and collect your cutlery. Only if you ask is it revealed where it can be found. A small shift in gear could really elevate the experience for travellers and justify it's room rate."

The reception & bar staff were friendly & chatty & remembered me from previous stays which was unexpected but lovely.  The food menu is limited but what you get is cheap & cheerful & most importantly delicious, really recommend the veggie burger & the veggie risotto which was a special one of the nights I was there! I’ll definitely stay again when I’m next working in Bristol!"
290,FDswansea,2021-10-31,"Decent rooms but limited menu and bar more like a canteen Rooms in the hotel are good but you get the almost the same from Premier Inns at half the price. The bar restaurant is like a canteen, cold and indifferent more like a small group meeting place. Menu is also far inferior to that on offer in airport Premier Inns that we have stayed at."
291,aellio323443,2021-10-31,"Great, convenient airport hotel Lovely stay, friendly staff and excellent service and very very clean, I will definitely choose this hotel next time I’m at Bristol Airport …. A very convenient position just a 4 minute walk to the Terminal"
292,Sungirltravel,2021-10-31,"Terrible Stayed at this hotel booked through work.On arrival at reception I asked for a top floor quiet room which I requested through an email.They said the hotel was full and placed me on floor 1.The rooms are small and very basic.Up to 2300 I had small children running up and down the corridor screaming.Doors slamming from 6am and hardly any sleep.The breakfast was luke warm and burnt sausages every morning.The reception staff are very unhelpful and would not move me to a quiet room as they said it would cost them to reclean my room.They are more concerned about cost than the guest having a good nights sleep.Went out the next day to return and my room had not been cleaned and no fresh towels.
Will not return to this hotel and to the reception staff please be a bit more friendly and courteous to your guests."
293,wmjhoward1,2021-10-31,"Excellent stay Excellent, very convenient stay.  Hotel is well managed and succeeds in almost all aspects. Clean, quiet, and comfortable.  Pretty good restaurant and bar and good service. We wouldn't stay anywhere else in Bristol."
294,LaidBacknHappy,2021-10-31,"Tremendous, convenient travellers hotel serving truly dreadful food. This is a very well appointed travellers hotel convenient for the long stay car park and the main terminal.  The rooms and public spaces are exceptionally clean and the rooms well appointed with nice bedding and super bathrooms.  The staff are excellent; friendly, helpful and remarkably cheerful.  The rooms represent good value for money.  The only real downside is the truly awful food; were it not for the food offering (<1*) this would be a 5* review.  As it stands, you’ve driven hours to get to your departure airport to overnight before a red-eye flight and you are faced with mass-produced, industrial fayre - burgers, deep fried ‘salt & pepper’ (?) squid rings and cardboard frozen pizzas - that are full of bad calories and are of little nutritional value.  Truly awful and at £12 for a cheese and tomato pizza (despite ‘authentic Italian’ claims, I cannot bring myself to call it a Margarita).  This really needs sorting out."
295,Lindzyg75,2021-10-31,Ok for a quick night stay before flight We stayed here the night before we flew to Mallorca. Rooms very clean and beds do for just one night not very comfy reasonable price for a quick night stay before catching a flight. Food was rubbish but staff were helpful and friendly.
296,dwoo811,2021-10-31,"It’s just ok … Easy to find, stayed here a few times, it’s probably the best hotel for a quick overnight stop if you are flying off early morning, the staff were friendly enough but look & appear miserable, I guess they are tired and overworked ? The food is shocking, we ordered the special curry & a pizza - the pizza was burnt & the curry was cold and tasted awful, the rooms are clean enough but are extremely cold I think the heating system is turned off at night ? It’s just ok here, a one night stay is all it’s good for …"
297,juliec289,2021-10-31,"Very average hotel This felt more like a budget hotel trying to be something different. It was very understaffed,  but I do appreciate the difficulties a lot of places are having in finding staff. The evening menu was very small and the food was average. Distinct lack of information both at check in and in the room. Parking also very confusing. We were told to ignore the signs at the entrance to the car park as they were incorrect - why not change the sign? The location was very good and the room was spotlessly clean, but we would not stay there again."
298,Relax393555,2021-10-31,"Mrs F Terrible dont stay here. Food is awful wine is even worse the only good thing is the location. Service is poor no staff. If you're old and don't have a smart phone, which we are not, but there were, you have to download the qr reader view the menu, which is dire, then line up and order. DONT ORDER A STARTER! THEY WILL FORGET YOUR MAIN AND THEN WHEN REMINDED ONE HOUR LATER ZAP IT IN A MICROWAVE!!!!! 

Shocking, bring your own!"
299,chriscraine06,2021-10-31,Average hotel Location right next to the airport is convenient albeit not many amenities close by. Food in the restaurant was very poor and would not recommend. Mattress and pillows were uncomfortable. Average hotel in good location. Overpriced in my opinion.
300,247gabrielles,2021-09-30,"Excellent stay with great customer service The staff was very helpful at this hotel! We were able to put our food in the refrigerator in the luggage room and they heated up food for us in the kitchen microwave. The room was a nice size even with our baby in her travel tent. There is not a guest laundry. They validate your parking so that it is cheaper when you check out. If you leave an come back within the day, just let them know so that you’re not charged multiple times. 
The breakfast our first morning was the best we’ve had at a Hilton in the UK. Everything was nicely laid out. They had waffles that were delicious with great toppings. The coffee maker worked well and even had hot chocolate. There was also fresh orange juice!"
301,SallyA351,2021-09-30,Book direct to the Hotel not through another booking company that charged £40 more! The hotel was perfect for a very short stay after a very early landing.  All staff extremely helpful and friendly even at 2 in the morning!  The room was spotless with a extremely comfortable bed and wonderful pillows!
302,352andrewm,2021-09-30,Good hotel for a one night stay Stayed a few times at this budget hotel located within a short walk from the terminal. Have always experienced a clean quiet room and a good breakfast. Probably not great value price wise but convenient for a one-night stay if you fly in late or fly out early.
303,hart662017,2021-09-30,"Consistently good and friendly service Clean,  modern hotel, with all facilities required for an overnight stay plus a well-equipped gym. Excellent breakfast with takeaway option. Reception was both efficient and friendly as always. Very convenient for Terminal"
304,richardcjarman,2021-09-30,"Excellent airport hotel. The Hampton is a very short walk from the main terminal and is step free, it should take no longer than a couple of minutes. You can reach the city centre and Temple Meads Station by the A1 airport bus which runs very frequently and on which senior citizen passes are accepted.

The hotel is bright and modern and is pristene. Covis measures are taken very seriously and the whole hotel is beautifully clean. The rooms are all standard quite spacious and very comfortable with a large bathroom with a large walk in shower. It is very quiet.

Breakfast is incuded in the room rate and a cold breakfast is served from 4am and the full breakfast fom 7am. The dinner menu is very limited, sandwiches, burgers and pizzas. The special was greek salad with tofu.......not something I would call ""special"". I chose the burger and it was actually very good with lots of cheese and bacon. The potato wedges were very tasty."
305,justhadtosay,2021-08-31,"Good hotel and location Often use this hotel but there is no other choice at Bristol if you want to be near the terminal. 
The hotel is fine. Not a luxury hotel but rooms are very comfortable especially for one night and very clean. 
Food is quite good for the standard of hotel. I often have the Greek salad which is excellent. 
Service is good and staff are masked and have some screens. 

Signs are up telling guests to wear masks and some clearly can’t read. I realise this is hard to enforce and idiots are everywhere but it did make us feel quite uncomfortable especially as we were going on holiday and the last thing we needed was a positive test result. 
Will use again mainly due to location which is great if your flight is very early."
306,JackieC559,2021-09-30,"Overnight stay Good location. As this is the only hotel at the airport there is no competition. Do not think it is worth what the hotel is changing. Rooms are kept very clean. Good selection at breakfast but was lacking cutlery, a lot of baskets were empty."
307,553geraldw,2021-08-31,"Disappointed - Not up to Hilton standards. As many reviews have stated, this hotel (although it is very convenient for access to Bristol Airport) does not reach the standards expected from a Hilton Hotel. However the prices do. The food, both in the evening and for the early breakfast, was poor. Eating in the evening, we were surrounded by people at adjoining tables who were complaining about the poor quality and high prices. Parking for more than one night costs double that of the multi-storey car park which is 20 metres away.
This place is designed and run by accountants, not hoteliers."
308,DavidRawl,2021-08-31,"Beware drop off process + 1 pillow per person and staff not wearing masks Beware drop off - If being dropped off beware there is a process to follow or you'll get a big fine (as noted in other reviews). There is no 'drop off zone' for the hotel so you need to enter the hotel car park and get a ticket. Then when checking in they will validate the ticket for a free period. You then give that back to your taxi/drop off and they can leave. They need to put this info on the Parking/Directions page as its not clear either before or on arrival - as noted by many others. 

1 pillow per person is so bad, it's funny. Cost, covid? No idea why - but the least ANY hotel of any class should do is provide 2 pillows per person. You can ask for more, and they were delivered quickly but whether to save laundry during covid or cost - whatever the reason they really should have 2 pillows in rooms. Its not a hostel. 

FOOD - Food was better than others have indicated. Menu was limited and I think if you go in thinking ""pub food from the 90's"" (not a bad thing) then you'll enjoy a decent meal. I can understand why others would expect more from an Airport hotel from a major brand, but it was just OK enough. 

ROOMS - rooms were fine (except the pillows) and a 3-5 min easy (uphill/steps) walk to the Airport was nice for a 6am flight. 

STAFF - I found staff helpful and friendly, especially our check in lady who doubled as our bar server and waitress too! However, there was one team member (I think the same one as referred to in many other reviews) who seemed  'abrasive' and lacking friendliness and a smile. I have to stay this team member also seemed very efficient and knowledgeable and I think their desire for efficiency and speed sometimes came across as unfriendly and unhelpful. Training would fix that. 

COVID UNSAFE - All front of house staff wore masks but no housekeeping staff had any masks on at all. I came across at least 4 housekeeping staff and none were wearing masks despite operating in tight hallways and the ones I saw made no effort to get out of the way forcing you to squeeze past them in close proximity with them wearing no masks. 

Worst some housekeepers seemed to be coughing and sneezing whilst inside cleaning rooms and in the air starved corridors - so whatever left their mouth or nose is now in your room, on your bedding, on surfaces. I also witnessed COVID cleaning protocols totally ignored and clear cross contamination between rooms (cleaning multiple rooms at same time, mixing items, etc). Terrible practice for the current times. 

The hotel was ""just OK"" (except the covid unsafe stuff) and the poor rating really reflects the fact that many of the issues raised in previous reviews (info on drop off on website, food range/quality, attitude of some staff, have clearly just been ignored over a long period. Just read the reviews - all these issues have been mentioned multiple times. 

I hope this review helps the management focus in on areas of concern and fix them - as they can all be easily fixed with the right management."
309,Tariq127,2021-08-31,"Good convenient Stay & Perfect has a base when traveling around the local area Had a very good 4 day stay here this is my 2nd time at the hotel thankfully i had a better quality stay this time and wasn't overcharged. 

I like how this hotel have shower rooms in all rooms and beds are comfortable. They are on the little small side but they are perfect for a few days stay. 

The main thing that is letting this hotel down is the quality of the food menu for a Hilton branded hotel it is very poor and the cheapest of cheap food is ordered from the suppliers i know Hampton by Hilton is meant to be budget friendly to compete with the likes of Travelodge and premier inn but most of the time premium prices are paid for the rooms here. For example this time  i paid £213 per night for the room. 

I definitely feel this hotel would be better has a Hilton Garden Inn especially when the Holiday Inn around a Mile or two down the road offers a very good menu. 

I have stopped in both Travelodge and premier inn airport hotel's and both have better quality food and menu's available."
310,jk4599,2021-08-31,"NO FRIDGE AND NO OPENING WINDOW?!?! Hotel was decent in a great location 2 minute walk from airport, but unfortunately we we’re only give 1 pillow each? And there was no opening window? A window that opened but with no handle? Makes no sense! Also, no fridge? Stocked or not they should definitely supply a fridge for the price!?"
311,michaelgO281IN,2021-08-31,"Great apart from bar snacks Great hotel,excellent parking onsite,let down by worst bar food ever served to me ever in a Hilton hotel.when we tried to to complain we were met with the manager was busy dealing with other food complaints £36 for a couple of burgers and 2 drinks very disappointed which was an excellent stay"
312,tanyacarlton70,2021-08-31,"Unfriendly Staff Having arrived at the hotel at 1 am after a long flight I was greeted by a surly, unfriendly and ignorant receptionist.. No smiles, no pleasantries, nothing.. I am amazed people choose hospitality as a profession that they clearly aren't enjoying.. Then the room.. Squeezing in a queen size bed doesn't make the room queen size.. I noticed the tea tray.. cheap condiments with no bottled water or buscuits.. the TV had very limited channels as most were unavailable due to signal issues.. thankfully the bed was OK.. In the morning it was a buffet breakfast (cereal, yoghurt, etc)  the sort you find in a cheap budget hotel.. Tasteless sausages and only scrambled eggs as an option.. Where's the smoked salmon???.. On arriving home I realised I have left my charger in the room..  no email or courtesy call from hotel to say this has been found.. This hotel is no better than a £40 a night Premier Inn style accommodation.. If you need to stay close to bristol airport choose somewhere else!"
313,Sixbells2021,2021-08-31,"Very convenient We are a family travelling with kids and always use this hotel as it is so convenient - literally right next to the airport (2 minutes walk).

315,cypriatvisitor,2021-08-31,Not the usual Hilton standard Stayed here few nights in a family room as a base for Bristol and surrounding area. Room was quite small for a family. No USB charge points in room. Soap in dispensers in bathroom had gone hard so came out as thick clumpy gel versus liquid. Room not serviced so no fresh towels for the 3 nights. Breakfast was poor. We have stayed at other Hamptons and breakfast was always good both in quality and options. Here every day there was some or other item not available. Had to always ask someone to restock the item. Seemed they were low staffed. Also hot breakfast was usually cold or luke warm. Scrambled eggs looked like yellow sand. Have to pay for parking even if a hotel guest. In general an ok hotel but lacks any character and not the usual standard expected of a Hilton.
316,whitcop,2021-07-31,Ok for 1 night We stayed for 1 night in July as we had a very early flight the next morning. We parked in the airport multistory car park so had a covered walkway to the hotel. Check in was quick and easy.  Our room on the ground floor was ready and the door sealed with a sticker showing it was sealed after cleaning.  The room was clean and comfortable and the shower unit was excellent. The range of food options available for an evening meal were  very poor and we choose not to eat.  They supply a take out buffet breakfast from 4AM but we did not use this service.
317,hayleyk140,2021-08-31,Nice hotel  Nice hotel. Very  close to airport. Like a 1 minute walk. Staff at front desk very friendly. Rooms clean and tidy.    Restaurant food was OK. Cheap and cheerful. Would stay again in hotel. Not many shops around for food but you can make do with what's in the airport.
318,Johnkitch1970,2021-07-31,"How can your room not be ready for check in at 8pm??? Turned up after several hours in the car at 8pm to be to.d our room wasn’t ready as it hadn’t been cleaned. With no room to get changed in or freshen up went to the hotel restaurant where we received over priced mediocre food from a very limited menu.
The one positive was breakfast"
319,U5947QNjessica,2021-07-31,"Excellent service The service was fantastic, the staffs were wonderful people and helpful when I needed a taxi. The cleanliness of the place was wow. My children were so happy and asked me to use only the Hilton Hotel and I have already booked in for my next trip in London."
320,MosPAFC,2021-07-31,"Eat before arriving The hotel is perfectly situated for the terminal; the staff are great and the rooms are clean and comfortable for an overnight stay.  However, the quality of food for an evening meal is shocking, genuinely the worst I have ever experienced.  My 'beef' burger was grey or green - I really couldn't tell - but certainly a colour I have never seen before on anything edible.  The wedges soggy.  My wife's meal had coleslaw that had a crust which you broke through - think Ice Magic if you are old enough to remember.  So, definitely stay there for position and incredible convenience but eat before you get there."
321,I4385UXhannahf,2021-06-30,Does the job The hotel is basic but very clean and only a few minutes walk to the terminals. Our flight was at 6am and breakfast was available from 4am which was great to be able to grab some food to go. The negative would be the hotel bar area which is not separate to the reception area and quite a depressing place to sit and have a drink.
322,Cgourlay,2021-06-30,"Perfect for a pre flight overnight stay Brilliant stay. Staff were very helpful and attentive and couldn’t do enough for us. 
Very clean and rooms well equipped. 
Hotel was very quiet which is was to expected. 
For a hotel pit stop it was a comfortable stay.
Food was good and good children’s option."
323,robertandhelen53,2021-07-31,An excellent stay The staff on reception and catering were excellent in looking after our needs as we had to self isolate and therefore depend on them for the room service. The drinks and food were delivered to our room very promptly and were of good quality. Thanks very much to the staff.
324,JohannesB119,2021-06-30,"Great stay - fabulous service I had to stay here one night, as I missed my flight due having spend 4 hours on the M5 (normal journey time 1.5 hours).  The hotel was spotlessly clean; very good rooms; excellent public room facilities and absolutely fabulous service.  The only criticism, and this is being really picky, was the limited dinner menu and in a twin room the desk is quite tight.  I could easily work in the public rooms on the ground floor, which are kitted out to work and relax.  
I would definitely stay there again."
325,912ashleae,2021-05-31,"Nice Hotel A really nice hotel, very modern and clean. Rooms are lovely. Bed isn't that comfortable though! But the close proximity and free breakfast is great. The price of a water bottle is ridiculous though and was tiny!"
326,798rosieh,2021-06-30,"Good base for local area Stayed for 2 nights in a short break using the hotel as a base for visiting a couple of local attractions. Hotel has plenty of Pandemice precautions and we felt safe at all times. Had an evening meal the first night, a little disappointing in the choice of food which is understandable in light of the pandemic. Room was nice and roomy comfortable beds and an good sized bathroom with a shower which was very efficient. Air conditioning was used very good and quiet. Room had goos blackout curtains. Breakfast was adequate. Staff were very pleasant and attentive especially Jess."
327,Tillard,2021-06-30,"Usual Hilton high standard Unlike most guests we were not flying into/out of the airport but chose this hotel for an overnight stay en route to our home in the South West.

We have always been impressed by Hilton hotels and this one didn't disappoint at all and lived up to our expectations.

Our room was comfortable, spotlessly clean and well-equipped with everything you would need from tea/coffee facilities to a safe, hairdryer and ironing board. Despite the close proximity to the airport and a surprising number of flight arrivals and departures we heard no aircraft noise at all.

We found the staff to be friendly and very efficient and they gace the impression that they seriously cared about looking after their guests.

Breakfast was excellent given the restrictions placed on the hotel by the Covid regulations. The menu for the evening meal was limited and service was a little slow but the food was excellent when it arrived.

Car parking for our overnight stay was £8. 

Overall, this is an excellent hotel and we would certainly stay here again if using the airport."
328,Deb86,2021-04-30,"Perfect for an early flight Great airport hotel close to the terminal just a 5 minute walk , not much of a menu if you are planning to eat here I would recommend stopping of en route to the airport for food. Maybe a tad pricey for what it is but for ease for a very early flight you can’t go wrong."
329,whitchurchsue,2020-12-31,"Perfect for Bristol Airport This hotel is 5 minutes walk from Bristol Airport and is ideal for early flights. The staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble even in these difficult times and they made us feel very welcome. The hotel is clean and well run. Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful couple of days."
330,janetrR8207VV,2020-10-31,"Quick stopover Overnight stay to catch an early flight.  very welcoming, room excellent, quick food service. Would stay again as it’s so handy for the terminal.  Only downer was getting breakfast, when the dining arrangements weren’t clear but this was due to COVID."
331,L7768EQdavidd,2020-11-30,"All very good except a bit cold Tuesday 3rd November and we booked to spent the night here due to its proximity to Bristol Airport, we had a 6.00 am check in the following morning. 

We checked in, got our key and made our way to our room. It was reassuring to see a paper seal on the door, which stated that the room had been deeply cleaned, we had to break the seal to enter. 

Our twin bedroom was bright, modern, very clean and well maintained. It was equipped with an iron, ironing board, television, hair dryer, tea and coffee making facilities were also provided. 

There was an air conditioning / heater unit in the room, we could not get the heater bit to work, the room was a bit chilly. 

As there were no bars or restaurants about we were limited to the facilities at the hotel. 

The bar, dining area and reception were all located in the vast modern open plan area on the ground floor. 

Two people working, reception, the bar and taking food and drink orders as well as serving them.  Caroline and  Becky worked hard to ensure that all guests were well looked after, all done in a cheerful manner. 

In accordance with COVID 19 safety measures we sat at a table, indicating we were ready to order drinks and food. Everything was delivered to the table, all table service. 

A pint of larger and ale was £8.30, reasonably priced and a lot less than we expected to pay 

There was a small food menu consisting of burgers, pizza, or a broccoli bake, we were informed by our waitress that there were 2 curry dishes of the day. 

We ordered chicken tikka masala and a red lentil Dahl which were served with rice and 2 small naan breads £11.95 each. It was rather tasty. 

As we were leaving, in the morning, before breakfast started, food bags were available for collection as we left. This consisted of a croissant, pain au chocolat, a banana and a juice. 

Overall we were very satisfied with all aspects of our stay, except that everywhere in the hotel was a bit cold, too cold for the time of year. 

Good food, reasonably priced drinks, really great staff, comfortable clean room, a good night's sleep and competitive room rates."
332,M4335ZNalanw,2020-10-31,"A very unhappy visit We had booked to stay overnight for an early morning flight in October. Our friend dropped us at the entrance to the hotel pay car park. He later received a fine notice from VCS for £100 for stopping less than one minute as we got our cases out of his car. He was not causing any obstruction, he did not get out off the car, he was off the main road,  there was no one else around and he had a blue badge! He appealed to VCS but it was dismissed. We had not been warned in advance by the hotel about stopping or the alternative parking arrangements to use the hotel car park and claim back the charge There was nothing on their website to indicates a drop off facility. When we contacted the hotel after receiving the fine the hotel staff were not sympathetic but agreed that it had not been made clear to us at the time of booking and there was nothing on their website about it. They said there was nothing they could do about the fine.
We had also ordered an early morning breakfast from the hotel. This was a fruit juice, coffee and croissants. When we tried to eat this before walking to the airport we were told we couldn't consume it in the hotel restaurant because of covid-19 restrictions, yet they were serving meals in the dining area the evening before! The alternative was to have it in our room which by this time we had vacated. We had not been warned about this in advance.  I asked the hotel staff where we could sit down to have our breakfast at the airport before going through security and they said they didn't know (and seemed to not care either). So we ended up having to have carry our breakfast along with our luggage to the airport. When I fed this back to the hotel afterwards I received no apology or any recognition of the problem. This hotel is certainly not customer friendly and we will not be staying here again. 
Overall Bristol Airport seems to want to stop people flying as it used to be possible to drop passengers off for free (10 mins max) but now it costs £4. At this rate it will soon be £100 or maybe they would prefer to stop people flying all together!"

What a little gem, we were very impressed as the first time staying here as normally stay at premier inn if a early or late flight etc. The hotel was lovely,clean,room perfect, we went for a drink and ended up having some food off the menu as it looked great and was too, not expensive either!!

My room had a seal on the door with information available about their upgraded cleaning programme. Absolutely spotless room, lots of hand sanitizing stations throughout high traffic areas.  The menu was better than I had expected after reading other reviews and the staff were very curteous and socially distanced appropriately at all times. Breakfast at 4am was takeaway bags with fruit juice and coffee available, perfectly adequate under the present circumstances.  Very pleasant experience and cheap at £63 for a queen room!"

He is an excellent ambassador to the Hilton hotel group. 
I will return. 

I should add that all the staff were fabulous."

Greeted by welcoming reception staff who explained all about covid masks, brekfast etc. We had four stays here this year and everytime we have stayed the hotel has been spotless, all measures for covid are in place. The room was really comfortable, clean and spacious.Bathroom had all essentials and nice fluffy towels. Breakfast was changed a few times due to the situation, but there was plenty, lovely grab bags, tea, coffee,juice etc. We had one full english which was lovely on one of the stays. Well done to all staff working there as these times are so difficult for the hospitality sector. Will stay again when travel resumes!"
338,Tariq127,2020-08-31,"Poor food, overcharged by just under £400  Checkin was swift i checked in using the hilton honours app i went to reception to get keys which were swift and all members of staff was wearing masks. 

Room
The room was clean on arrival and i like how every room had a walk in low profile shower. I originally stopped here from the 24th August to the 26th august and the shower kept filling up i reported this on checkout. I checked back into the hotel on the 28th August and thought I would check into the same room and guess what the shower still kept filling up so my repair log basically went ignored which I found to be very poor.

Food
The food is very poor the dinner choices in the restaurant is extremely limited the burgers were dry and tasteless the best burger i had which isn't displayed on the menu is the quorn burger I found that was fairly meaty. For the overall quality of the food it is overpriced and a complete let down to have the hilton name attached to it, i am aware of hamptons business model of a limited food menu but that doesn't mean the food has to be low quality and generally food I would find in Iceland. Even the pizzas were poor they were very dry with not much cheese on and even that is frozen. 

Staff First of all I would like to give a shout out to the following staff members who provided provided good customer service and went above and beyond Stuart from night staff, Anna, jasmine from night staff who helped me resolve the overcharge issue and spent two hours with me to resolve it she should definitely be manager. Sadly the night staff were a lot better than the day staff I found a lot of the day staff to be lazy and i even had a situation where a member of the bar staff ""Tony"" refused to carry some drinks over to my table with being disabled and using a walking stick i can generally only manage to carry one drink at a time, i asked Tony if he could carry the drinks over to my table has i had 4 drinks and he said I can't do that but i can give you a tray, i clearly made it clear it was only to my table but when i made a complaint he lied and said he thought i meant taking the drinks to the room which I didn't mention at any time.

Overcharged 
After 7 days of stopping in the hotel has i used the hotel has a base for my stay caution when it was due to checkout at the end of my booked days my illnesses were flaring up so I kept extending my room on a daily basis. Well after a few days of being in the hotel i checked my bank account via cash point and figured that i had some money missing from my account. I checked with the hotel and they said everything that was charged on the bill was right but something still didn't add up. Well two days passed and I found some receipts and the remembered hotel kept wanting me to preauthorise some funds for the bar has after 10pm you can only charge to room which i was fine with at the time. But when i had my final invoice the hotel didn't take off the funds from my invoice that i preauthorised the bill was £1453 but yet the hotel pre authorised £1845 which is way too much meaning I couldn't spend that money and the hotel didn't release it back to my card. 

For anyone aware of most hotels the hotel shouldn't generally take no more than £50 to £100 pre auth then any charges take off the amount already preauthorised and any money left over after charges release back onto card and do that every 24 hours. Well this hotel didn't do any of that they took money charged from my account and kept almost £400. So if you are going to stop at this hotel keep a careful track of your balance and try and do everything pay as you go rather than charge to the room.

Parking is charged at £8per day which is reasonable for a airport hotel although most people do only stop for 1 night unless stopping there on business i think for stays of 3 or more nights they should have a cheaper rate where you can buy in advance of say £5 per day.

Overall it is a nice modern hotel has plenty of disabled parking spaces although having a disabled badge doesn't give you free parking i often stop at Travelodge in Gatwick when flying from there and disabled badge holders get free parking there and that's Travelodge which is a lower class of hotel so i think Hilton should offer it to their disabled guests. The hotel is generally open plan. With everything that has happened I don't think i will stop here again next time i will stopping in the Holiday inn which is located 2 miles down the road and offer a free shuttle to the airport."
339,MervFrome,2020-09-30,"Brand new hotel with basic furnishings and awful menu Expected the Hilton brand to live up to its reputation for quality, but sadly disappointed. The room was clean and new with basic furniture, the lounge area had no soul and was like a waiting room, and the menu was so limited that you could have found more variety at a roadside snack caravan. The hotel car park and surrounding entrance belongs to Bristol Airport and any unwary traveller stopping to read direction notices faces a fine of £100 - and staff assured me that many had been caught. The management explained that they were operating under Covid 19 restrictions but so were the other hotels in our trip, and they managed to provide a far more comfortable experience. On the upside the airport is right on the doorstep, but I certainly wont be using this place again. I also noted that the bill showed on my credit card as being paid on the day of arrival, but was still there eight days later as a pending charge. I had to phone twice to have the duplicate amount removed."
340,Raisingdoves,2020-09-30,"Reliable - welcoming - peaceful room Always love it here.  Reliably quiet, welcoming and quality customer care every time.  Thank you to the staff especially during this Covid time. Breakfast was really good and flexible in being able to take it back to our room.  Highly recommend this hotel."
341,Thespy55,2020-09-30,Could not fault this hotel The hotel was simply immaculate and super clean. The receptionist was very welcoming and informative about the routines and procedures in place. The room was spotless and the bed was super comfortable. The service in the restaurant was excellent and the fishcake special was extremely tasty. The great breakfast was incredibly well organised.
342,L9254XAkarenm,2020-09-30,"Perfect 1 night stay before our flight. Very good COVID measures. Hand sanitiser everywhere. Rooms sealed until you enter. Very clean. Food available and quick service. Can’t fault really. Comfy beds, helpful staff and good sound proofing"
343,AmyLJ,2020-09-30,"Best choice for Bristol Airport While it wasn't cheap to stay here with 5 nights parking in the multistorey (£190) , we felt it was worth it just for the convenience, having a 6am flight. 

The room was very clean and comfortable and the staff were amazing.  The covered walkway meant it was just a couple of minutes walk to departures.  Best of all was the continental breakfast which was available from 4am.  There was plenty of choice and if you were in a rush to get to departures, as we were, there were bags you could take already filled with fresh fruit and cereal bars and you could add whatever you wanted from the continental buffet plus the hot drinks were given in handy takeaway containers.  Highly recommended and won't hesitate to stay again."
344,dans1977uk,2020-09-30,"Very clean, safe and convenient Stayed the night before an early flight in early September 2020.  The hotel has adapted really well to social distancing, and while still offering a full bar and restaurant service, it feels safe.  The staff all wear face coverings and they are strongly encouraged for guests.  The breakfast starting at 4am was perfect as I had to leave by 5am, and everything was individually wrapped and / or sealed, primarily using paper too which is good for those of an environmentally concerned stance as most of us are these days.  Friendly staff, and the room itself was comfortable and clean.  No problems at all really, other than the whole 'sliding-door-for-the-wardrobe-and-the-bathroom-in-one' thing... it's just not right (IMHO) - put a proper door on the lav when you build the next hotel, Hampton!!!

Oh - gluten free options were safe too as my partner is coeliac and ate safely here :)"
345,BricklayerUk,2020-08-31,"Fabulous hotel We came to this hotel after being let down by the dreadful OYO WINFORD MANOR , who cancelled our reservation without reason.
We arrived at the Hampton By Hilton ( HBH ) and asked if they could accommodate us, fortunately they could. The reception area was very impressive, smart, spacious and welcoming. We were registered efficiently , and given our room, which was spacious , comfortable , beautiful beds, good power shower , TV , coffee and tea facilities, a sign on the door and a seal , saying that the room had been sterilised , and it really was spotless.
It was beautifully quiet , and a comfortable environment in which to stay . The cleanliness really impressed us , especially with the current situation with Covid. There was sanitiser in the room too.
In the reception , the bar was functional , and we enjoyed a couple of drinks, and then we booked a table for dinner, menus all done via QR code , really good, hygienic and functional.
The menu although limited, was excellent , I enjoyed a very nice burger and my other half enjoyed a pizza !
The hotel is a few minutes walk from the main terminal , so very handy. Normally , I would have booked the airport parking for an extra night, but as this was a last minute booking , we had to pay the HBH rather high overnight charge of £ 16.50.
Staff here were fabulous , very friendly , welcoming and very Covid aware.
Great choice if you are flying out of Bristol !"
346,V9999DQmarilyns,2020-08-31,"Lovely friendly hotel Perfect airport hotel 
A big thank you to all the lovely  staff at this hotel , especially to Chris , such a credit to your hotel , he was so professional and I’m sure he will go far in the hotel trade ,"
347,I89CCsaraha,2020-08-31,"Hard working staff Had to write a review to compliment Jed and Jez, morning staff at Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport.  The pair of them were hard working, professional and friendly whilst dealing with breakfast within the limitations of social distancing (I have learnt to hate that phrase!).  Well done and thank you to both Jed and Jez, five them a pay rise!!!!"
348,ronfromglasgow,2020-08-31,"Great job in difficult times I have stayed here many times on a regular basis and reviewed it before. That was in what we used to call normal times. Times are different now. Hilton must be congratulated on the effort they have made to secure a safe stay. Everything well thought through. In particular, I hope they appreciate the excellent team of staff they have at this hotel, despite new procedures and being rusty after so long a closer, they are enthusiastic, cheerful, friendly and helpful. I thank them."
349,itsBryne_Norway,2020-07-31,"A very good airport hotel. If you plan to stay at/close toBristol airport, this is the place to stay.

The hotel is in easy walking-distance from the terminal. I guess 200 meters. 

The hotel seems to be very new and very clean.

The rooms and bathrooms have a good size.  There is lots of available space for car-parking ‘next door’. 

The staff we met were nice and helpful.

They seem to be taking covid-19 very seriously. This had seriously affected their breakfast and made it simpel, but sufficient. If your flight is very early, breakfast is available from 0400.

I am glad we choose this hotel for the one night we had to stay close to the airport."
351,ingsss,2020-03-31,"Brand new hotel - perfect after a late flight arrival! Really nice and new hotel, with reasonable rates. Was really pleased with the appearance and quality of the hotel. Wide selection of items for breakfast and a nice bar area for a relaxing drink on arrival"
352,alsaldevon,2020-03-31,"A Bad Experience We will not be using the hotel again. We had an early morning flight so we arrived early evening. We planned to have a pre-dinner drink, a meal and retire early. The bar serves drinks and also takes the food orders. The drinks were overpriced and the food less than appetising, all served in a public seating area that had less ambience that a factory warehouse. The management might also get a grip with customer service. Our accommodation was a pre-booked Queen Room with a bed that proved extremely uncomfortable. On the basis of our evening experience we chose not to sample the breakfast offering. The only redeeming feature of our stay, was the early morning call that was on time."
353,LynnG1479,2020-03-31,"Overnight stay before catching flight The hotel was welcoming and staff friendly and helpful, the room was clean and comfortable.breakfast very enjoyable .would stay there again very close to airport but very quiet and had a really good nights sleep.was able to walk to airport although my mobility not very good"
354,mikedI1090LS,2020-03-31,"Pre flight hotel  Breakfast good. Other meals tasteless and overpriced.
Very cold bar and food area, don't think they want custom in the bar.
When arriving late evening after a flight, the bedrooms are cold. Would be nice if they could warm them up a bit as they know you are arriving.
Dislike having to have drinks booked to the room. Chose to have a coffee in our room instead. Hiltons loss."
355,BobsCardiff,2020-03-31,"Heartless Hilton My wife and I used this hotel last December, the night before a flight to Porto and it was excellent, as per my TA post back then. As aresult of that experience, we booked again for March, 2020, prior to our trip to Rome. Covid-19 resulted in easyJet cancelling our flights. We contacted the various providers for our trip and had the following responses:-
easyJet - full refund of all flight and associated payments
Private taxi firm for transfers in Rome - full refund less £10 cancellation fee.
Mercure Roma Centro Colloseum Hotel, Rome - they have offered to keep our reservation open and honour it for 9 months, despite it being a non refundable booking. Bless them- they didn't have to at all.
People and businesses in Rome are experiencing a devastating collapse in their tourist trade and yet they have the decency to try all they can to accomodate travellers. Good on them and great foresight as those travellers will return.
Now to the Hilton Hotel at Bristol and their response. Via Booking.Com, we requested not a refund but that we simply be allowed to change the booking so that we could reserve a room in July when we are due to travel to Krakow. The trip to Rome was for our 35th wedding anniversary and my wife has an autoimmune condition called Sarcoidosis which affects her lungs. Despite Booking.Com, in their words, 'reaching out' to Hilton, their response was a flat refusal to move the date of our booking. We are going through an unprecedented time in the world at the moment when what we need to see is compassion and selfless acts as displayed by the operators in Rome. What do we see from Hilton? Pure greed and total intransigence. Shame on you!"
356,zafterbir,2020-02-29,"Very close to the airport When ever we travel out of Bristol on an early flight or arrive back on late one we always stay here 
Very clean hotel, the beds are so comfortable, you have free toiletries and a hairdryer in the room and if you require breakfast or an evening snack all catered for you 
This hotel is a two minute walk from the airport"
357,UKIan,2020-03-31,"Disappointing stay I arrived at the Airport  after a delayed flight, it was 0030 when I reached the Hotel. I had already checked in and got my digital key so made my way to my chosen room.  It took a few attempts before I made it into the room.. The room was cold and unwelcoming. Initially the TV did not work but after some time I realised that the electrical lead had been removed from the back of it.
In the morning I took a shower which wet the whole of the bathroom floor and I had to use a second towel to wipe it up.
The room was average of  Travelodge standard and vastly overpriced at £96.00 for what was about a 9 hours stay. The only positive is the location especially late at night as an alternative to going into Bristol. I am a HHonors member but am unlikely to stay at this Hotel again unless the price is more competitive."
358,329ElizabethB,2020-01-31,"Hotel great - carpark nightmare I was staying overnight before flying out to Portugal next morning. My son was dropping me off at the hotel. It was dark and foggy. He drove around to car park where there was a gate and no clear drop off place. I got out of the car and went into the hotel to ask why it was so difficult to drop off. In the mean time my son drove in through barrier gate, parked and came into the hotel. The reception manager said that the process is that one should drive in ( obviously without pausing) and park. Then bring ticket into hotel for it to be verified then person dropping you off can get out of car park. My son then said goodbye and left. Not exactly an easy drop off. 
Since then we have had a ticket fine for £60 for stopping. We challenged it and showed evidence of the car park ticket. Our appeal has been rejected so, rather than have high blood pressure, we have paid. So BEWARE if you plan to be dropped off at Bristol Airport Hilton. If the hotel happens to read this perhaps they could put a warning on the booking email?"
359,Rooftop_Beach,2020-03-31,"Reasonably priced We stayed here on Sun 1st March. Quick check in at 20.00 with friendly Receptionist. We got a quiet room on the lower floor away from lifts as we requested in advance. Bed was very comfy and no noise from outside but we had a bad sleep because pillows were way too soft and flat.

Everything worked well in our room. Only hairdryer wasn't very powerful. Housekeeping had done the great job. Room was very tidy and clean.

Ideal for early morning flights at Bristol airport. You could ask for takeaway bags at reception if you wish. We check out at 4am and had a nice continental breakfast while listening to 3 Receptionists laughing and chatting pretty loud at the front desk until we left at 4.30am....Many guests were having breakfast but they all were quieter than those 3. We could hear them since the lift was opened at lobby floor 😓

Very easy to walk from the hotel to passenger terminal if it is not raining."
360,Tipsy252,2020-02-29,"Good night before early flight This was the third or forth time of staying here as it is the most convenient hotel, being almost linked to Bristol Airport. Arrival and check in was pleasant and swift. I was recognised as a Hilton Honours member and was given a room on 3rd floor. The rooms are very quiet and comfortable, walk in shower a great bonus.
Dinner was a basic affair with limited choice on the menu, but the food came promptly, was hot and tasty. All you could ask for really. The dining area was not too busy, but some of the tables could have been cleared and cleaned down a little quicker. Didn't have breakfast as we left at 06:15, just a juice, but the hot breakfast (starts at 6am) looked good.
All in all a pleasant relaxing stay before our early flight. Will definately stay again."

Room was modern and the best walk-in shower with very nice toiletries provided.
Happy to see breakfast started at 4am so I was able to have a cuppa and croissant to go (bag provided).  Easy walk to Airport terminal on ramps.
Staff were helpful and friendly. Will stay again."
363,466howardj,2020-02-29,"Handy stop off destination for early morning flights Very modern hotel nicely appointed throughout. Very accessible to and from the airport with a ramp approach for wheeled suitcases. There is cafeteria styled eating with orders placed at the bar.No fine dinning as such but the food was very pleasant and probably just right for families with children. The staff were pleasant and efficient. My only niggle was that the room although very modern and spacious, was very cold ( albeit on a very cold February night.) There was no extra blanket to supplement a rather lightweight duvet."
364,Gloomgirl1,2020-02-29,"Nice Lovely clean room, perfect for travelling to and from bristol airport as it is opposite and only a short walk from the terminals. Not too expensive and is very quiet. Staff were lovely and very helpful. Food is nice but it is a shame there is no room service."
365,natml,2020-02-29,"Great customer service - the staff couldn't do enough Booked for an overnight stay the night before a very early flight, only I came down with a severe case of food poisioning within a matter of an hour of arriving. Not related to the hotel as we had literally only just arrived. 

I was unable to make my flight the next morning and had to ask to book a second night at the hotel as I was too ill to travel anywhere. The reception team were fantastic in booking us in for another night and makinbg sure we stayed in the smae room so I didn't have to move, they also added a complimentary late check out for the next day.

On our final morning my husband wanted breakfast but it has closed, and Zoe from reception went and got food and drinks for him. 

They staff realy did go above and beyond to make us feel as comfortable as possible.

All rooms are soundproofed so even though you are so close to the runway you cannot hear anything.

We will definitely be back."

Had a good night's sleep , comfy bed , shower  was good , room had toiletries,  flannels,  kettle and coffee . Breakfast was a buffet help yourself , which consisted of coffee tea fruit juice , cereal  bacon egg or continental , there was plenty of choice and could help yourself to as much as you wanted ! Check out was quick and walk to airport departures was a 5 min walk.  Would definetly use this hotel again"
367,Diggy52,2020-02-29,"Exellently situated -  but food choices very poor. It would appear no one from the management team is taking the trouble to review people's comments and make improvements.   It just didn't feel like a proper hotel - the furniture and colours in the bar area were out dated, even though the hotel is only a few years old. Staff worked between the bar and reception, so there was a wait for drinks. Most of us want to start off our trip abroad with a nice meal the evening before, but you can't do this here.  The choice of food, from a tatty bar menu, was very, very poor. No chance of a proper meal and not something you would expect from a large chain hotel.  It is a shame, because the hotel is so well situated - a few minutes walk from the multi-storey car park and the terminal.
On the plus side, the food was edible, but nothing special.  The rooms were spacious and clean."
368,PaulaWare,2020-02-29,"Late arrival overnight stay  We arrived about 11 ish in the evening

Nice to at last have a hotel at Bristol airport 

Several flights of steps to go down outside to access the hotel.  Difficult with heavy suitcases.  No obvious signs for accessible entrance ....  disappointing 

Pleasant open space and warm welcome 

Had Queen size room. Felt it was designed for one occupant not a couple. Good sized comfortable bed but very close to one wall so difficult to access from one side.  

Excellent bathroom - with good shower and toiletries

Complementary breakfast from 4 to 10 made us smile.  At over £110 a night it was clearly included in the price and many early morning travellers wouldn’t want it anyway- rather grabbing something at the airport. So good marketing?

We went down to breakfast at around 9 45.  Plentiful food left with just a few gaps.  Good choice well displayed.  Had the cooked breakfast - not sure the scrambled eggs had ever seen a fresh egg, but generally OK. 

Went back to get a second coffee and toast - to find the door had been shut - and breakfast finished on the dot of 10!   So don’t be late even if you have arrived late at night!"
369,TorquayIain,2020-02-29,"convenient but..... although the hotel is only a couple of years old, we're not fans of the open plan combined reception/bar/restaurant, our table was dirty as were others nearby, the food was very forgettable.

if we stay again, we'll get a sandwich to eat in the room"
370,cg26Bath,2020-02-29,Much improved I have stayed here before and although the rooms were comfortable the bar / food experience was extremely frustrating. I stayed here last week before an early flight and was pleased to see they have improved the ordering of food and drinks. You now can get served quickly and they also have a good gluten free menu. The Rooms are extremely comfortable and well equipped.

372,MT48,2020-02-29,So Convenient Stayed here one night as very early flight the following day. Good reception and room clean and comfortable but on the small side.Limited menu but my burger pretty good. One drawback was the poor design which means bar and eating area just inside airport side entrance which was in constant use so you were sitting in area where the wind and cold hit you regularly.
373,211carlk,2020-02-29,"Lovely one night stay Stayed here one night after our flight landed late and didn’t want to drive home.

Quality hotel. Very comfortable beds although the room was very small. Had a sofa bed in the room for our daughter. 

Great breakfast. 

The only let down was the sofa bed wasn’t made up on arrival so had to wait for the staff to arrive with bedding to male it up. 

Other than that the hotel is great."
374,Palmaexpat,2020-01-31,"Lovely staff Access with international luggage in winter is a bit of a bind with 100's of meters of uncovered sloping pathway, and no apparent direct route via a pedestrian bridge, which would make life a lot easier !!
Wryly when booking I requested a seaview, and some resourceful employee put up a poster on the window of a beach scene, which gave us great amusement and delight.
Unfortunately a 'leak' alarm went off at 1am so we had to call for help which came quickly, but of course we were jolted awake, and then the blasted thing went off again at 2 am !! Profuse apologies were given. Then to ensure we were completely wrecked, the electric bedside alarm went off from a previous inhabitant's request, at 4am. (we had to get up for 5am, so staggered like we were like parents of newborns out of the hotel, without trying their breakfast)"
375,jacquelinem181,2020-02-29,"Meal Lovely Comfortable clean  hotel and so close to the airport but I wouldn’t have a meal there again.
My husband had the steak pie mash peas and gravy.
I had the chicken bacon and tarragon pie with mash and peas. The pastry was hard the filling had hardly any chicken in it the sauce was dry and wasn’t rich at all. The mash was made up packet mash. For a Hilton hotel I was expecting it to be much better and home made and for the price of £15 each it was not good. 
As compensation I got a free apple crumble and ice cream and my husband a coke. The apple crumble was a bought in one and not home made it wasn’t bad but not great."

The food was very good and plentiful portions we will certainly consider the Hilton brand in future.
386,DizzyChickKimmy,2020-01-31,"Super convenient Booked directly with the hotel and Silver parking rather than as a package as cheaper. 

Parked the car and took the shuttle to the airport and then walked down the slope to the hotel, very short walk and part was under a covered walkway which lit up when you entered so felt very secure. 

Front desk staff were not overly cheerful but did offer an early morning call. Room was adequate although the bathroom could have been cleaner, particularly the shower floor. The main issue was the noise of the air con/shower fan which was rather noisy and distracting, particularly when you only booked to get some sleep before getting up at 3:30. 

As we had a very early flight we had breakfast shortly after four, very good selection, more than we were expecting for a cold breakfast and then only a short walk uphill to the airport. 

Quite expensive considering how little time you spend there but can't beat the convenience of being just a short walk away"

390,Ivorbrownbum2,2020-02-29,Airport stay over. Nice room but restaurant limited menu. OK if you like pies. Beware when booking we got court thinking we were booking direct at a good price ie £73 only to find a bogus US site added £43 extra which made it more expensive than the hotels own price.
391,1Swansfan,2020-02-29,"Very comfortable and convenient. Overnight stay before early morning flight, spotlessly clean, modern hotel with a short stroll to the airport departures, easy check in with the Booking.com app. Would most definitely stay there again."
392,D6595JAchrisc,2020-01-31,"You'll be ready for take-off staying here Stayed here one night before an early flight to Aruba via Schipol.  Hotel room was clean and comfortable. Good location to the airport, the hotel has a car park but I used the multi storey car park which is 3 to 4 minutes walk from the hotel and the hotel is literally only a 5 minute walk away. Overall a decent stay and would recommend. 
Good choice of breakfast, continental from 4 in the morning and hot buffet from 6 am. I am a Hilton Honors Gold Card carrier and the standard arguably puts this Hampton top of he pile. Would stay there again and recommend – unlike Hampton Stansted Airport which is a disgrace to the brand."
393,klingoneddie,2020-01-31,"comfortable and convenient Stayed here  for a night prior to an early morning flight.
The hotel has a carpark but I used the multi storey car park which is 2 or 3 minutes walk from the hotel. Its also convenient for the airport check in, less than 5 minutes walk away.
Check in was swift as I had used the app to choose a room earlier that day so had my key card within seconds of saying my name. It helped that there were 3 staff and only a couple of customers I guess, but its still the quickest I have ever checked in to any hotel.
Room was clean, bed was comfortable and a nice walk in shower area. Couldn't fault it.
Breakfast in the morning was only a buffet (it was 5.00AM) but it was fine.
Guess we could have gotten cheaper accommodation somewhere but it wouldn't have been anywhere near as convenient as this place.
Be sure to use ""Hilton Honours"" when booking to get the best deal.
Will use again"
394,aliceer31,2020-01-31,"Decent stay  Stayed here one night before an early flight to Paris. Check in was easy although being dropped off in the hotel car park will cost the driver £2 for up to 20 minutes! 
Check in and check out was easy. Hotel room was very nice, modern and clean. Good location to the the airport, literally only a 5 minute walk and has ramps to the terminal which is good when you’re lugging a large suitcase around. 
Food was mediocre but can’t complain when breakfast was included for free and started at 6am which was good for us as we had to be at the airport for 6:30am. 
Overall a decent stay and would recommend."
396,PeterSa1,2020-01-31,"Brand new comfortable airport hotel This hotel is very new and clean.  Located very close to the terminal, it provides a great option for those arriving late or leaving early.  My room was stylish, clean and comfortable.  The bed was very comfortable.  Tea and coffee facilities were in the room, as was an iron and television.  A gym is available on site.  Breakfast was included and of reasonable quality and choice.  Although not the cheapest hotel, this is a comfortable option and I would be very happy to stay again."
398,ABC99999999,2020-01-31,"Handy for the Airport Close enough to walk to the terminal. Rooms are fine. One very annoying item is the green light from the air con unit, 3 feet from the pillow. Shines like a torch all night. Will have to take cellotape with me next time to mask it. Else difficult to sleep, and the window doesn't open. Quality of food is variable. Lots of choice for breakfast, but lots of cheap quality. A few decent quality cereals would work wonders, instead of supplying obviously the cheapest range available to caterers. will stay again because of convenient proximity to the terminal, but will go better prepared next time."
399,connorr607,2020-01-31,"Nice place before/after flight We stayed here the night before and night of our returning flight. Easy 5 minute walk from the airport and a bus through airport car park too. Breakfast was a good spread, Continental from 4 and hot from 6. Room was nice and clean, no noise from any neighbouring rooms or nearby planes. Just a note, the alarm clock in room has a dimmer button as the highest setting acts more like a night like if not dimmed."

402,Luecht,2020-01-31,"Ideal if you have an early flight, but at a price. I had to take a 6am flight next morning so was booked in this place since it is really walking distance from the airport. I’m fact, of you have a rented car, you don’t need to keep it for the night if staying here (!). It’s a modern place and straight forward hotel, with good beds. The shower was not completely clean though and had some hairs of previous visitor. The staff is helpful and friendly with a particular positive remark for front desk officer Jez! The food however is of mediocre quality at best. The burger meat was dry as it can be. The only positive thing I can say about the breakfast is that it starts at 4am already, so you can grab a cup of coffee and something to eat even with the earliest flights (on weekdays, in weekends it starts at 6). If you brand yourself under the Hilton name, one expects a bit more."
403,Go535673,2020-01-31,"Poor meals Nice rooms ,breakfast  is great and tasty but the evening meals leave a lot to be desired,pizza cooked on top but raw in the middle, steak pie and mash is re heated in an infamous red oven making mash n peas crusty and dry, wouldn't advise evening meals so far."
404,mollstone,2020-01-31,"Convenient with a but I stayed here twice in the past week for 3 nights total . It is extremely convenient for the airport with clean, well equipped and comfortable rooms . 
Service is friendly- a bit too friendly this week when the cleaner barged in my room without knocking at 07.40!
The food however (I think) falls well below the Hampton standard . They specialise in a “special” - curry which was well received by my colleague. I had 3 different dishes  but all appear to be prepared in advance and microwaved . Not the best . However if you’re not fussy the prices aren’t expensive. The one thing I was pleased about - lime and soda is still 50pence !😀"
406,hutchy013,2020-01-31,"Great for an overnight before flight As always with a Hampton, very clean with good breakfast and friendly staff. Room was far too hot and AC was damaged panels missing above door and panel on wall did not work. No window to open so sleep was extremely poor. Also it not clear at time of booking you need to pay £16.50 to park overnight. My wife and daughter were on a flight in the morning and I had to set off early 4:30 am so did not use Bristol airport parking which would have been more than 16.50 anyway. Please note this if you plan to stay. Breakfast served early which was a big bonus."
407,Bluebird50,2020-01-31,Reasonably priced convenient location Used for a night’s stay prior to flying out the following morning.  Very convenient with trolleys stored part way between the hotel and the airport (Bristol airport’s £2 non refundable charge for a trolley is a rip off but not the hotel’s fault).  Breakfast perfectly adequate and will cater for most guests I would have thought.  Didn’t try the restaurant or the bar so can’t comment.  Rooms a decent size and no noise from planes taking off or landing.  Used the multi storey car park which is a two minute walk from the hotel.
408,dtaylo144913,2020-01-31,"Overnight stay before an early flight Very handy for the airport. The staff were very welcoming and helpful.
The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The restaurant was simple but adequate - a small selection of dishes available.

Check on parking charges before booking, as we were charged £18.00 to park overnight."

We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we entered the hotel and shown to a lovely window table in the restaurant. We were looked after by the wonderful Marta who was so helpful without being too intrusive, Marta is a real star. A lovely selection of sandwiches, cakes and scones and we were even provided with some boxes to take home several cakes which we didn't manage to eat. A wonderful experience, many thanks to everyone involved."

Buffet breakfast is lovely and the restaurant I have used on a few occasions for evening meals.
The thing I love about the bar in the hotel is Chakir who works the bar most weekends.
He is so lovely and welcoming and even remembers what my preferred drink choice is when I am staying.
Big comfy beds, clean bathrooms
Only criticism is try not to get a room on the 3rd floor if you are working as this seems to be the party revellers floor that are having a Saturday night out in Bristol so it can be a bit noisy"

The restaurant was busy but the staff Arc & Chakir worked very hard showing us around and how everything worked and made sure plates were taken away when diners had finished. The full English breakfast was of good quality and plentiful and was a buffet service. The evening meal was limited choice but adequate. Overall would stay again for a short stopover.

The bread was stale and it was a proper let down. I took my sister there because of a illness and was let down. To say I was mad was an understatement. We were given egg Mayo sandwiches, tuna and sweetcorn, a fatty piece of ham. We were quite surprised we were the only ones there. But hey now I understand why."

I stayed a week on business, my room had cracked sink, stain on chair, broken aircon and room is very small, bathroom tiny. Its a good location and reasonably priced and has parking at the front which is operated by a different company. Gym is tiny and limited. I asked the staff to fix the aircon which they didnt,  they apologised and moved me to a room with working aircon but missing toilet roll holder and broken towel holder. Breakfast is not too bad and evening meal is about right for the hotel. Would happily stay again if the rooms were much better."

48,Expedition820826,2024-03-31,"Nice stay but little pricey Arc and the rest of the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was very good, however slightly reduced during the week (the waffle machine was not operational).
The hotel is in need of repairs, one elevator was not working and there was no air con in the room (reception offered to change rooms or get a portable heater).
Good location between the train station and the centre.
Overall we had a nice stay, although it's priced for a 4* hotel, it didn't quite feel like one."
49,janieCrawleyUk,2024-03-31,"Good location but very busy When we checked in there was also very large groups on city breaks which meant there was no access to restaurant from 6.30- 8-30 for two nights . 
There was just 4 tables in the bar so we sat there . 
On the 2 nd night we were told we didn’t need to reserve a table in the bar but found all tables reserved so we sat and ate anyway . 
Other hotel guests were turned away . Very bad show after a long day and nowhere to eat .  So beware if large groups are in hotel you will probably have to go out . 
The rooms are quite small and not even a coat hook to hang wet coats on . 
The fridge is in an awful place . The cupboard door opens one way and the fridge door the other which was fun !  
In a great location though but at the front there is a lot of traffic noise if you have the window open .  
Breakfast was a great choice and the servers were great . But once again with the large groups eating breakfast it was very very busy . 
The stairs were a bonus to use as one of the lifts were out of order . 
Beautiful park out the back and easy  access to shops"

The only criticism I can provide of the stay is perhaps the size of the bathroom and the position of the toilet making it difficult to use for the larger person.

59,sarahjanem72,2024-02-29,"Good stay at the Hilton Visited this Hilton to attend a gig at the Marble Factory, which was within an easy walking distance.

Reception staff were engaging and friendly and checking in was quick and easy.

Room was sufficient. It was comfy enough for 1 nights sleep as somewhere to get your head down. A little rough around some edges but nothing bad enough to complain about.

Breakfast was very good. On arriving to the restaurant, we were greeted by Arc who was friendly and informative. Love a big smile in the morning!!! 

All in all, a really good stay. Would come again and would recommend."

Bathroom a bit dated and shabby but clean and again had everything you could need.

Both nights we ate in the restaurant , and on the Saturday night we were very well looked after by Arc, he was so attentive and helpful and was very careful to highlight my seafood allergy with the chef , I have never had it taken so seriously in any restaurant before . I was so impressed. The menu has great variety and the pizzas and chicken burgers were really delicious . We would definitely recommend staying here it’s only 5 mins from the train station too ."

Thank you!"
125,D1026JMbethanyp,2024-01-31,"Lovely place to stay! This is was my first time staying here and I’ve really enjoyed it. The beds are comfy and rooms and bathrooms clean and spacious. Despite being clean my only concern is in my room there was some staining on the desk seat, curtain pelmet and the wall. Other than this the room was spotless. The staining isn’t obtrusive so it’s more aesthetic than an actual issue hence me not bothering to raise it. Also there’s a spacious mini fridge which was helpful. 

The reception staff were very welcoming and friendly and somehow the main atrium smells amazing almost like a really nice aftershave which I really enjoyed. 

I opted for breakfast to be included and was very pleased with it, their English breakfast was delightful, properly cooked and flavourful. The only critique I had was for the pastries as they were a bit tough, perhaps a tad over baked but still edible and they go down well with a cup of coffee. They also have coffee syrups available which I greatly appreciated, not a lot of places bother with them but I love them so was pleased. 

I had two people serve me during breakfast, Navi and Priya, they were so welcoming and attentive, made sure I had everything I needed and were swift to remove finished plates. I felt very well looked after.

Overall I’ve enjoyed my stay here and look forward to returning next time! 

Thanks for having me! 😊"
126,jacksB8180DN,2024-01-31,"Service Class Great service from Arc & Navi, nothing was too much or too little. Constantly asking if we needed anything or if they could go the extra mile. With it being a buffet service you don’t always get that level."

Room was smaller than expected for a queen room and the price attached to it. Creaky bed and a strange fousty smell which we think came from the air vents.

Breakfast was nice. Simple and easy. 

Evening staff in the restaurant clearly did not want to be there but the morning staff were lovely.

Disappointing for the price paid. Would not stay again."
130,DawnD828,2023-12-31,"Nice stay Nicely placed hotel close to town centre.  Staff at check in and out lovely.  Friendly.
Room fine except the A/C fan was flipping noisy!!  Nice toiletries. Shame there is no complimentary biscuits with tea tray!!
Breakfast very good. Poached eggs are ordered at the time you request and are perfect.
No butter, ham ran out but rest good.
Parking should be free as £20.00 expensive but seems to be the norm these days!
Why does the bar close so early?  Also, small bottles of prosecco needed as large bottle was only option.
Would stay again."

Conveniently located 10 minutes walk from the railway station. The environment is clean and elegant. Among other things, a big thank you to Navi Arc‘s service, very warm and attentive, making you feel at home.
酒店位置处于市中心，旁边就是圣殿。交通便利，距离火车站步行10分钟。环境干净优雅。其中，非常感谢Navi Arc的服务，非常热情与细心，让人感觉宾至如归。"

145,U4289JKstephenf,2023-12-31,"An excellent stay Spent an overnight stay at the hotel to attend a work Christmas Party event. The accomodation and breakfast were very good, however, the level of support and help by hotel staff was truly excellent; particularly Priya in the restaurant and Peter at the front desk."
146,52alc,2023-12-31,"Great end to a long weekend. The staff were really welcoming and very helpful. Nothing was too much trouble!

Breakfast was well maintained and again the staff were very attentive and full of smiles on a particularly wet and miserable day."
147,l0uisehi,2023-12-31,"Perfect one night stay Nice room, comfy beds and had everything we needed for the price. lovely breakfast and servers Navi and Patricia were lovely and lots of choice to eat. My step daughter got to make her own waffle and i am gluten free so lots of choice. Thank you"

Like to call out Mariano reception and Navi and Patricia in the restaurant, as they’re really accommodating"
149,lucyls2018,2023-12-31,"Very pleasant stay We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn hotel in Bristol for one night. The location is perfect for a stop-over before catching a flight, because it’s just a stone throw away from the train station where one can catch the airport flyer. We received a warm and friendly welcome from Annie on reception. Our room was clean, warm, and we had everything we needed. We enjoyed our breakfast at the restaurant. Our host, Arc, was polite and attentive. He made sure that we had everything we needed. Overall, this was a great experience and we will definitely stay again if we are in Bristol."
150,samuelwW414XX,2023-12-31,"Business Trip Breakfast was brilliant with loads of options to choose from. Arc was especially attentive and did his job brilliantly!

The pillows were slightly too low for me so meant sleeping was a bit of an issue, but nothing that couldn’t be sorted out at reception. 

Would definitely stay here again!"
151,EllieD05,2023-12-31,"Lovely place  Lovely, welcoming and very clean place. We only had dinner at the restaurant. The food is freshly served and delicious. Arc, the waiter, was very professional, friendly and helpful. All the staff is welcoming and friendly."
152,georgealexandrup138,2023-12-31,Friendly and lovely staff  Very friendly staff. Would come back that is for sure . We have ordered two chicken burgers with two extra skin on fries and they were delicious. Staff helped us with the kids chair and entertained him .
153,627callumt,2023-12-31,Excellent Overnight Stay I had an excellent overnight stay here. My room was very clean and had everything I needed in it. The restaurant serves very good food and the service provided by Arc was great! I would definitely stay here again in future.
154,726ayeshaw,2023-12-31,Yummy Great Christmas due. Food was lush 😋 Second year in a row for us no and no doubt we'll be back again next year. The chef Shyam was lovely and came to check we were happy mid way through. And Navi was a great server
155,Blonde_Kim_89,2023-12-31,"9/10 Nav bartender, helpful and polite. I am on a business trip and got a great coffee from the bar. The venue is comfortable and nicely lit for work or socialising. WiFi is fast and useable. Rooms excellent as always. I always choose Hilton for my trips. Thanks"
156,Q4765WLdavidb,2023-12-31,"Lovely Christmassy Stay Lovely Christmas atmosphere. Staff and food were great, especially Arc & Navi. Close to the Christmas Markets and Cabot Circus as well as Bristol Temple Meads for easy transport links. Would recommend."

159,stephenh333,2023-12-31,"Don't bother if it's you have an electric vehicle! 4 EV spaces at this hotel all occupied, 3 of them non EV, and none of the chargers being used. The hotel refused to do anything when we requested, noting that we booked this hotel as they advertise EV chargers. There was also a loud party going on. We asked for a room as far away as possible but they still they put us directly above the noise. This is only understandable if the hotel was fully booked. Will not be using this hotel again."
160,lisylouHerneBay,2023-12-31,"Annie on reception is an outstanding asset to this hotel Great business hotel in the centre of Bristol with everything on hand.  Rooms clean, with refreshments and all amenities.  Due to road closures, one-way systems and driving around an unfamiliar city in the dark, I couldn’t find the hotel car park so I called the hotel and Annie was like a Christmas guardian angel, she was so patient and helpful personally guiding me to the hotel and then when I arrived she greeted me with a wonderful smile and a complimentary drink from the bar - customer service has deteriorated over the years but Annie’s was first class and I wanted to personally recognise her and thank her from the bottom of my heart for her amazing customer service 💖💖"
161,698ka,2023-12-31,"Avoid at all costs. Everything else was fine apart from the Friday evening, after coming back to the hotel from dinner and drinks, the hotel had music absolutely blaring all through the hotel down in the bar and restaurant.

This went on for 2-3 hours and didn’t finish until 12am…

Really unnecessary with how loud it was, we were not impressed and essentially had a really crap sleep due to this. 

I’d recommend not going on a weekend as you will get no sleep!! 

Avoid avoid avoid."
162,aliBristolUK,2023-12-31,"Family Xmas meal Had a lovely Christmas meal. Have not been into the hotel before , but all the staff were friendly, it was warm and welcoming. 

The food was excellent perfect potions and beautifully displayed. 

We had crackers with our meal which were high quality and like everything else it showed someone had cared 

Will definitely going back and a little gem in central Bristol with outside space somewhere to remember for the summer as well"
163,839lizl,2023-12-31,"Hidden gem Went for a family meal in the restaurant, beautifully presented, lovely food and great service. would definitely recommend.
Bit of a hidden gem restaurants over looks little park at the back comfortable and clean and for a city centre hotel I was very surprised"
164,amitbangre,2023-12-31,"Excellent Staff I had a wonderful breakfast at Recess restaurant today 3rd December 2023. The food was delicious, the service was fast and friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy and relaxing. I especially want to thank the staff (Ash, Zyra, Navi and Keely) for their help on a super busy day. They were attentive, courteous and professional, and they made sure that everything was perfect. I really appreciate their hard work and dedication. I would highly recommend Recess restaurant to anyone looking for a great place to eat in Bristol. It’s a hidden gem in the city centre. Thank you Recess for a memorable experience!"

166,W7606RBjasonc,2023-11-30,"Happy customer  Really good quality hotel, the service was particularly good. The air con didn't seem to work at first but that was probably an easy fix if I had asked for assistance. 

Navindu was always welcoming and polite at meal times."
167,337michaelm,2023-11-30,"All ready for Christmas What can I say, this hotel delivers where others don’t. Credit to the new management team is due where all the staff in this hotel make the guests there no1 priority, the ambiance they give out with their warming smiles is ama img to see.

There continuous effort from reception to the f@b staff with Subash and Patricia, cleaners and the Night team is applaudable.

The rooms are not the biggest but they serve there purpose, with the large TV’s, walk in showers and a desk for your business requirements. My room was spotlessly clean and my bed remade every day which I did not expect.

Breakfast- In the past I have criticised this but this now seems to be resolved with fresh hot breakfast with plenty of choices for croissants, fruit and cereal along with all your Juices. The coffee is supplied by machine with various types of hot drinks available.

Dinner has gone up a notch too, despite the new staff who are very welcoming, I was honoured when the Chef called Aimee personally delivered my delicious dinner to the table, what a personal touch! Food was delicious in flavour with great presentation.

The Bar with Ethan , what a polite gentleman was quick and efficient too.

My check in and out, Is far better than any other hotel with that warm personal touch from Annie, Juan and Peter and the rest of the team.

The complimentary gym is a small gym but served me brilliantly for my purpose, A couple of bikes and a treadmill with a weight set.

The Christmas decorations look great! 

Thank you for an Amazing stay."
168,O6981DWrebeccaw,2023-11-30,Great value afternoon tea A really lovely afternoon tea. Sandwiches were ace. Cakes and scones delicious. The staff made it extra special. Perfectly Attentive without being ‘in your face’. Friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Thank you to the lovely restaurant manager.

170,Maxschichi,2023-11-30,"An almost perfect hotel What a delightful stay we four old school friends had at this hotel. The hotel is situated within easy walking distance from the railway station and in a slightly longer walk to the town (but still walkable). Our twin room was fairly small and the bathroom was very small. However, they had everything necessary for a good night's sleep - a comfortable bed, excellent toiletries. The only time the size was a problem was when  the four of us wanted to meet in our room for a chat and there was no room to sit except on the beds.  The lounge/bar area could also benefit from more comfy chairs. The best part of our stay was the wonderful breakfast - the best buffet I have seen in a long time and poached eggs or an omelette cooked to order. Wonderful. I must mention Ash (Subash?). He made a big effort to ensure we were comfortable and had everything we needed, both at breakfast and later in the day when we were chatting near reception. He's a star. 
All in all this is an almost perfect place to stay and  would definitely book again if I'm in the Bristol area."
171,GailMaidstone,2023-11-30,"Great hotel  Very warm welcome from Peter on reception, very helpful when helping my sisters find their way to town, Peter was very friendly, he always welcomes us as if we were friends. The hotel is lovely, good mattresses and bedding, bathroom a good size, very quiet even on the road side. Breakfast is great, plenty of choice.  Maria on reception is also lovely and very helpful, this is our first choice when we come to Bristol."
172,PEDROWINE,2023-11-30,"Lost their chance Room was small and smelly. Noisy. And over tiny beds. I cannot see a well-built person sleeping in such a tiny bed or taking a shower in a ridiculously small bathroom.

What made me specially angry was their check in policy. I am well aware that rooms need to be cleaned but I guarantee that the hotel was not full and the lady in reception did not let me check in before their official time. She was obviously busy when I arrived and showed zero friendliness and readiness to help.

Too many other hotels in Bristol."
173,tmahee,2023-11-30,Comfy stay Easy and comfortable stay and friendly staff … both check in and stay was excellent. Subash at breakfast was par excellence for customer service and friendliness . Great place always to stay.. we loved every bit of it including breakfast etc …
174,Asl2023,2023-11-30,"Needs improvement The receptionist, Victoria, was very efficient and quick, her lovely disposition made us feel welcomed.
The personnel in general was friendly.
The points are deducted mainly for the quality of the food at breakfast, wine, which was sour (as a person who has good knowledge of wine), and the facilities, for example the hair dryer's tip was melted and we were afraid to get electric shock while drying our hair.
The mattress and pillows were very uncomfortable."
175,matthewtP3125PD,2023-11-30,"10/10 Very clean and tidy and friendly staff 5*

Finally one of the staff ( Peter*) was paying attention. Saw the problem and moved me again to a clean room with an OK mattress. Investors, senior management. Buy better mattresses, manage your housekeeping. Lazy owners !!"
179,martakA2541OM,2023-11-30,"Great location Very good service, reception very helpful, good breakfast. Stayed on a business trip, lobby is very handy, plenty of parking, bar & restaurant available in the hotel and plenty options around. Highly recommended."
180,a_o000_a,2023-10-31,"Satisfying The room was comfortable and had everything needed. The staff were helpful. But for the price I do not think it was anything spectacular. Some of the reception staff came across as a bit snobbish, when I had questions and when I paid for the stay. If I visit Bristol again, I will most likely stay somewhere else."
181,martinsR8297CH,2023-10-31,"Great weekend away in Bristol The Hilton Garden Inn was a great weekend away. First big tick was parking and EV charging. Our room was to a good standard, with a kettle which is a bonus. I like to make my own expresso coffee in the morning. 
The breakfast was great. I like to eat well in the morning so I can power through to dinner. That starts with Yogurt, nuts and fruit, then poached eggs with bacon on toast. 
The hotel is in a great location, close to Cabot Circle shopping center and an easy walk into town.
The staff as always were attentive when asked and could not fault them."
182,131alishahk,2023-10-31,"Nice & Relaxing Stay  Overall stay was very good. Booked two rooms and was completely satisfied with both. Peter at the front desk was kind enough to give us an early check in. Breakfast was delicious and the restaurant staff was lovely. 
Although we had some issues with hot water in one room but thats not a thing to rant on. Thank you. Will definitely consider this hotel when coming to Bristol next time."
183,197shirleye,2023-10-31,"Value for money Hotel was great value, all staff was helpful & friendly. A good range of food at breakfast and we had an eve meal which was faultless. Bedrooms clean and comfy. And within 10min walk of the train station and Cabot’s shopping centre. Definitely use this hotel again"
184,aandmriley,2023-10-31,"Horrible experience For some unknown reason I was given a disabled room. Bed small, opened the curtains to find workmen looking it from a building site next door, double bed small, room cramped.  Car Park difficult to access by a number of roads closed.  Some temporary signage or e-mail giving directions to the car park should have been given. On the plus side Breakfast was good.  Best thing about the hotel and experience was leaving after I had checked out.  Not impressed!"
185,A4455FBdavidh,2023-09-30,"Excellent Stay The reception staff were faced with a high volume of guests trying to sign in at the same time (4 coach parties), and managed to do so very quickly, by working in tandem. The rooms and facilities are of the highest quality. The restaurant staff were faced a with similar volume of guests wishing to dine, and again handled this situation in a seamless manner. Preparation and planning is paramount for good customer service, the manager is to be congratulated for the staff's ability to switch to plan B when a situation like this arises"
186,mattbun,2023-10-31,"Good stay spoiled by automatic service charge and then gratuity in restaurant. The hotel is well located, within a couple of minutes walk of Bristol Temple Meads station.  No issues with the room or the bathroom although I do prefer a harder pillow than the super soft ones provided.

My only criticism of the place is how they automatically add 10% service charge to the restaurant AND then also ask for a gratuity.  Easy to miss the 10% charge on the bill when there is a large space lower down for you to also write in a gratuity.  This feels like sharp practice to me so I thought I would share it on here for people to make their own decision on the policy (or maybe for the hotel to defend it)."
187,geoffreyj169,2023-09-30,"Misleading information on hotel website I was staying in Bristol overnight and wanted to recharge my EV hybrid car whilst parked overnight. I chose this hotel partly because of the location and because the website states ""Electric Vehicle Charging Points Free To Use When Paying To Use The Car Park"". To me this implies that you can recharge your EV free of charge if you have paid the £20 overnight car park fee. This is not the case. You will be charged the standard rate per KWh as shown on the BP Pulse EV charger - currently £0.79 per KWh for a Type 2 connection. I have complained to Hilton and suggested that the website should make it clear that charges still apply"
188,Rx8231,2023-09-30,"Just Poor Parking is on site, however it is extortionate at £20 per night when it is free between 6pm and 8am if you pay online rather than in the hotel.

Three members of staff behind the desk, check in still takes an age. Had to spend 10 minutes whilst the member of staff figured out that I didnt have to pay for the room as the business had already paid it but was adamant that I needed to pay. Once she had sorted that without any sort of apology whilst making me wait 10 minutes and show her a number of emails I finally got the key which didnt work so back downstairs to get that resolved.

Air con does not work, the room was absolutely boiling.

Will not stay again and instead stick to the Moxy whose rooms are so much better, air con works and parking is half the price or less."
189,B4670XAnick,2023-09-30,Great location in the city centre Stayed here overnight when we dropped our daughter at her university digs nearby. The location worked perfectly for us. Hotel was clean and welcoming and staff helpful when I needed to change to a non feather pillow. Would definitely stay here again. Only issue ws a very noisy slamming fire door next to my bedroom that kept waking me. I’ll ask for a room not near one next time

Totally recommend."
191,badcop,2023-08-31,"Great value and location. Perfectly situated for me, near the railway station. Most buses go from outside the station too. I used both to visit family and friends during the week. Bus service is very cheap. I did 2 trips into Somerset of an hour each way...4 pounds return! Train goes to Bath every 10-15 minutes. Everything in the centre is walkable from the hotel.
The hotel itself exceeded expectations. Good price compared to what I've been paying recently. No complaints about anything and the staff were happy and helpful. Great soundproofing against outside noise. There was a bad storm one night which I didn't hear at all."
192,hollieob,2023-08-31,"Lovely hotel! Convenient location! Lovely hotel, staff where helpful. Room was nice and clean-only slight down side was some parts of the room where looking abit tired (window ledge chipped and arm rest on chair was ripped off)

Great location as only a 15min walk into the city centre. 
Really enjoyed our stay!"
193,PatSoBon,2023-08-31,"Highly Pleasant Stay Experience  Love that hotel location is central to many facilities of transportation including the train. Every staff whom we interacted with are highly courteous, and we were spoiled for choice at breakfast. 

Should we come to visit Bristol again, will definitely choose this hotel again."
194,Z2588QXruthb,2023-08-31,"A pleasant stay in a convenient location The Hilton Hotel provided a good stay for the night I was there. The room was small (as was the bathroom) but well furnished with plenty of storage if you'd needed it. My biggest grumble would be there was no choice of pillows (they were all very soft which I struggled with). I also struggled to have a hot shower as the water kept going cold throughout. There was a good selection of hot and cold products available at breakfast. I had a meal in the onsite restaurant, which was nice, but expensive at £22 for a chicken burger and non-alcoholic drink."
195,vanessac824,2023-08-31,"Friendly and comfortable  The hotel is in a convenient location near Temple Meads station and it’s not too far to walk into the city centre or catch the river ferry. Our rooms were clean and comfortable and a couple of housekeeping problems were dealt with quickly. Special thanks to receptionist, Peter, for his warm welcome and local knowledge, making our stay so much more enjoyable."
196,robww,2023-08-31,"Great location, helpful friendly staff This is located on or near Temple Back and central to a lot of attractions and places of interest. There's a nice park behind west and ultimately the routes into the town centre (10 mins walk) £ Parking is available on site and also at an overflow facility on Church St behind.
Welcoming reception and a cool bottle of water too which was much appreciated.
Room was clean, bright, quiet and the air con superb. Everything worked fine. Would stay here again.
Didn't use the restaurant or bar but it looked welcoming and decent. There are alternative eateries just a few mins to the west on Victoria St."

199,tj4000,2023-08-31,Modern clean and comfy Clean modern hotel. Good breakfast plenty choice. Comfy beds and pillows. We arrived 2.50 told we were too early as check in at 3? Reception lady said she'd come tell us when room ready altho she didn't!  When we checked out we weren't asked if we'd had good stay or if everything was ok which I found strange. Most staff did not seem very happy to be honest but all in all a decent hotel .
200,Kirsty0994,2023-08-31,Not the usual Hilton standard Lobby area was lovely & the restaurant looked nice although didn’t eat there. Rooms - very basic and furniture old fashioned needs an upgrade. Beds were very firm gave my partner back ache. No nice toiletries or vanity set in the bathroom and our room wasn’t cleaned during the stay. Does the job but for the money you’d expect more. Not up to the usual Hilton standard.
201,960JenniferB,2023-07-31,"Great location, lovely staff. Bathroom small and entrance needs signposting due to multiple road closures. The location is great as we visited the quay and Wapping wharf. The staff were friendly and the reception area and restaurant are lovely. The only negatives for me were the extremely firm mattresses which meant I woke up in pain as o have arthritis in my back. Also the bathroom was very small with various bottles of products (shower gel , shampoo etc) glued to the wall which kept falling off. Not really 4 star bathroom ! At the time of our visit there was a lot of road closures in Bristol so we couldn’t find the car park entrance , this needs signposting clearly by Hilton in the end we went down a one way street to get in after driving round 3 times!"
202,T5563EUrobynh,2023-07-31,"Great place to stay!  Annie at the front desk was so welcoming! Every staff member was friendly and helpful. Also…there is onsite guest laundry!!! When you’re traveling for two weeks this is a huge perk! The room was nice. Bed comfy. We ate dinner at the restaurant and the food was great! 
The only “negative” is there is construction all around. But we were already up. Oh and there is parking on-site"
203,raginic2014,2023-07-31,"Experience to cherish Had a lovely stay at the hotel, the staff were friendly and nothing was too much, I was traveling with my mum who had mobility issues and from check in to check out they couldn’t do enough. Breakfast was functional but the chef was around to prepare omelettes and the lovely ladies helped my mum through the buffet. The rooms were clean and sufficiently stocked. Loved the atmosphere in the restaurant, although the weather was dull. Thank you, will surely be back."
204,nick164,2023-06-30,"A couple of housekeeping issues and poor sleep quality. The hotel is located a short 5 min walk from Bristol Temple Meads station. Staff were welcoming and friendly throughout the stay. Guest rooms are small, but sufficient for a shorter stay. 

A small buffet breakfast was available, with poached or omelette cooked to order. For dinner, the service was good (the waiter was attentive and good care was taken over allergy requirements) - the pizza however was a bit doughy, and the lighting was exceptionally bright thus ruining the ambience.

The condition of the bathroom in the first room allocated was not in keeping with a Hilton - dripping plumbing in the shower cubicle, broken soap dispenser and a stained toilet seat. Upon raising with reception, they capably resolved the matter with a change of room and provided a complementary drink from the bar whilst I waited. 

The main issue was the sleep quality - one of the least comfortable mattresses I've ever slept on (I stay in hotels 2 months per year) and given the noises from the springs clearer long overdue for replacing. Air conditioning was noisy and did little to cool the room, with only a small window partially opening as an alternative. I was not asked how my stay was on departure.

As sleep quality and housekeeping standards are non-negotiable for me, I wouldn't recommend a stay."
205,AndyG447,2023-06-30,"Generally a comfortable stay Check-in was simple, the staff were very attentive and the room was very clean and well decorated. The only disappointment was that the shower was squeezed into the corner of the bathroom (next to the sink) and it was difficult to get in and out. The water temperature in the shower was slow to heat up then difficult to control. Would I return? Yes, of course."
206,drewmI408CH,2023-06-30,"Interstellar customer services from dedicated team of individuals  Nikita, Cicely and Victoria, who work the desk are legends. I somehow managed to book the wrong week for a pretty boring business trip. The checkin team managed to find me a room for the whole week despite being fully booked and they even managed to keep the costs down considering the late nature of the booking. I’d actually double booked next week one Hilton stay and a holiday inn stay. I’ve cancelled the holiday inn booking for next week as these guys deserve my business. Top marks for customer service despite me being a dope."
207,wdoug53,2023-06-30,"Needs air conditioning! Room was hopelessly hot and stuffy, despite noisy air conditioning going full pelt.  There were no opening windows.  Staff were friendly and helpful, but utterly unable to help.  Two nights with little sleep.  Avoid."

There was parking at the hotel as well as EV charging for my car. Breakfast was buffet and of good quality. They pouched me eggs every day.

This hotel is not high lux, but well run. I would definitely stay there again."
211,jonfK8841FB,2023-05-31,"A modern hotel in a good location with parking - Housekeeping and Breakfast issues A modern hotel in a good location with parking (@ £20/day)

The rooms are compact but adequate. Housekeeping a tad patchy, waste bin (almost overflowing) not emptied however more disappointing was the breakfast offering.

Day 1 the hotel appeared not to be very busy and a lot of food had been cooked and left under heat lamps for what appeared to be a long time. Consequently the bacon was extremely tough and the fried eggs together with the sausages, hash browns and baked beans were well past their best.

Day 2 the hotel was much busier and there was a higher turnover of the breakfast items improving the overall offering to OK.

For me, part of the hotel experience is the good old full English so from this experience I would not plan to revisit."

213,LittleMissExplorer27,2023-05-31,"Reasonable but won't use again Good location for the centre and Temple Meads. Staff were efficient and friendly at check in. The rooms are tiny, basic and dated, but reasonable for the price and location. Air con was very noisy, and you can only over ride it for about 30 mins before it kicks back in - which woke me up a few times in the night. In the morning, reception told me they could have remotely switched it off had I called down - fair enough. I was just trying not to wake up too much. 
One of the soap bottles fell off the wall in the bathroom in the small hours, which also woke me up (they are just held on with a sticky pad). 
The beds are extremely firm. Pillows and duvet are heavenly and there is a good selection of pillows of different firmness. 
There's a knack to getting in the shower as the doors open onwards into the shower. It took me a few goes to work it out as the door was quite stiff. The door wouldn't stay shut while showering."

215,Londonatlarge1,2023-04-30,"Excellent service I arrive late, and the staff could not have been more helpful
There had been a booking mixup, and I was in a twin room not a double
However, the beds were incredibly spacious even as a single
The lovely staff gave me a drinks voucher to compensate
When I went to the bar, the lovely barman when he heard about my awful day, also gave me a drink
Breakfast next morning was absolutely wonderful and what a cheerful chef they have Boba. I think he is his name
My parking and breakfast was also complimentary for the mixup
This post is not about how to get free things. It is about the kindness of staff going extra mile like Bailey and Victoria on reception.
I really had had a terrible day, and their kindness was most appreciated
It is also to say that when things go wrong, they apologise and put it right, which was the polar opposite of my experience at the Marriot the week before
It really does not cost that much to give you a glass of wine, but it makes all the difference to the customer"

217,Red9uk,2023-05-31,"Good hotel - but noisy road and poor A/C This is an excellent hotel in the city centre with clean rooms and good facilities. The bar and restaurant serve quality food and drink and there is parking on site too (chargeable). Staff are professional and efficient. I also liked the outside terrace at fe back of the hotel to enjoy a quiet drink with the sun setting over the city.
 
My only criticism of the hotel is that because it sits on a main road was the noise from the front and that the A/C was ineffective. Despite the window being shut road noise is still there and if you’re a light sleeper you may be affected.

The A/C control instructions didn’t match the controller in my room and whilst the fan was blowing and thermo down it simply didn’t effect the temperature and in the end it was just too noisy and I switched it off.

I wouldn’t choose this hotel on a warm Bristol night."

 Special mention about Peter on the front desk! He is fantastic, a true credit to the team. He is always friendly and remembers any requirements I need for my upcoming visits which is so lovely and thoughtful. 

The rooms are clean and the beds are soft and comfy. You have also been supplied with all the products to clean with like shampoo, conditioner, hand wash and even body lotion.

I think the location of the hotel is perfect. It is only a 15 minute walk to college and its not near any shops or pubs so its quite tranquil in the evenings and mornings.

221,MrsBear49,2023-04-30,"Disappointing - very uncomfortable bed Stayed at this hotel for work and for the money paid and standard of hotel I really expected better.  

To be fair the lady on reception was great on arrival and very friendly.

Got a room on the third floor at the back of the hotel so it was quiet.

The rooms are much smaller than Premier Inn and the bathroom is really tiny.

The worst thing of all was the beds. It was a twin room and it wasn’t until returning much later in the evening that I got in bed and realised how very uncomfortable both beds were. They were really rock solid and creaked at every movement. My back and hip were aching from lying on the bed so I had to lay on a pillow which wasn’t ideal but at least gave relief from the mattress. I thought about going to reception but it was late and as I was only staying one night I couldn’t face trying to move rooms.  Didn’t have a good night at all.

Tried the fitness centre which was reasonably well equipped but no instructions on how to use the machines which would have been helpful.

When I left no one on reception asked how my stay was which I thought was incredible.

Didn’t try the bar or restaurant so can’t comment on these but based on this stay I won’t be going back to this hotel as it was very disappointing. 

To me the room should be built around the bed and this must be the most comfortable feature. Sadly Hilton failed miserably in this regard."

Room needs a makeover and should not be made available to guest until it has been done
Various shades of white paint does not look good, paint the whole room do not just touch up.
Hanging rail in wardrobe had dust on it
Arm on the writing desk chair was damaged making it look ugly
Ceiling in shower area paint was peeling off
And finally there was poo in the toilet bowl

Did not want to make a fuss while we were there as it was a birthday celebration and did not want to spoil the day/evening 
But had to write this review as I do not want other guest paying for this room before it gets a full makeover

The walls were grubby and in need of a fresh coat of paint, but overall the room was clean. Lots of noise echoing down the corridor until well past midnight. Other guests slamming doors mainly. Not ideal when you when you want an early night. 

I checked in quite late and checked out early and was still charged full 24hr rate for parking which was £20. 

My rate was for bed and breakfast, but was listed as room only in the restaurant so had to present my booking confirmation to prove this. Poor for a 4star hotel but the member of staff handled it well. Wide range of options for breakfast and the food was tasty. 

If you are looking for somewhere to stay and don’t need the frills of a restaurant or gym, then you get a better room for a cheaper price at a travelodge or premier inn; both of these are nearby."

I did read some of the poor reviews after I booked but for one night I valued the location over anything else. Happy I stuck to my plan. The hotel was absolutely fine. Modern, comfortable and spotlessly clean room. Efficient and friendly staff at check-in. The parking charge is a bit steep but I guess it's normal in the city centre. My only minor criticism - given that the room appeared to be recently renovated, the lack of USB charging by the bedside was odd. Driving to the hotel was hugely frustrating - do NOT attempt to navigate to it using the main hotel address! There is no vehicle access from Temple Way, which has clearly been designed to frustrate drivers as much as possible with ""no turn"" restrictions everywhere and absurd one-way systems everywhere. Navigate to ""Temple Rose Street"" instead which will take you to the car park entrance at the rear of the hotel."

The service was decent but it was pretty much only a case of check in and check out, so no major issues there.

Annie on reception was very friendly and helpful, as was everyone else we interacted with during our two day stay.

Our room was fairly small but was modern, quiet and had a nice view over the park.

The safe was closed when we arrived so we couldn’t use it the first day we stayed. The gentleman on reception did offer to stow our valuables in the hotel’s safe though. There was a small window in our room which did not close properly. And unfortunately our fridge didn’t work either.

One thing I missed was hotel information. There was nothing in the room, I’m guessing because of Covid. I had to ring reception to find out what time breakfast was.

Breakfast buffet was good, although we got there at 9.30 and items were running out (eg no more yoghurt). The pastries and eggs and bacon were delicious. And there was real orange juice!"

The king rooms are well appointed with plenty of storage and a mini fridge, good shower and Crabtree & Evelyn separate shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, unlike the one-bottle-cleans-all approach in similar chain hotels. The hotel sits by a major road but the sound proofing is great and the rooms are airconditioned.

We’ve had less problems at Ibis when we stayed in them. We book Hilton as last resort because there are always problems with the rooms. The staff is lovely and they make up for the shortcomings with the rooms/building/equipment. In this place Peter and Viktoria were great help and made us feel like we were important customers. I hope the company rewards them accordingly as they are true assets to the Hilton brand.

261,W5059KEdaniele,2022-09-30,"Unclean and expected more from a Hilton Hotel. Very disappointed with this hotel to be honest seriously expected more from a Hilton hotel, a travel lodge would have been better. 

Firstly there’s nowhere to park, not nearly enough spaces for such a large hotel, had to go in and ask where to park and in the end the lady at the check in desk told us to just park in the electric car charging station and the next morning people were parked up against the kerb next to the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful which is probably the only benefit to this hotel. Walked in the room and it was… underwhelming for a Hilton but I don’t really mind about that. 

As an honors member when I usually stay in Hilton hotel’s the beds are usually very comfortable however this one was not, very boxy and hard had an almost cardboard top feel to it, and if you plan on staying here I hope you like ultra soft pillows that sink to the level of the matress when you put your head on them.

Now for the reason I wrote this review. The bathroom definately had not been cleaned properly, there was facial hair on top of the shavers socket and on the silicone holding the tiles to the wall which I have attached pictures for. As for the toilet, well let’s just say the bottom of it looked like brands hatch race circuit. I didn’t say anything at the time since I was only staying 1 night and was leaving very early in the morning but I knew straight away I’d write this review! 

Overall very disappointed and expected much better from a Hilton hotel!"

But we’re going to find somewhere else (Holiday Inn most likely). The beds here are crippling (can hardly stand straight in the mornings), my room has not been cleaned or restocked (it’s 6pm) but the biggest problem is the restaurant. Last night they had a big party in so was told couldn’t eat in the restaurant. Tonight they have another big party in but they cannot serve anyone else any food. That is ludicrous for a City Centre hotel aimed primarily at business people. What do they expect guests to do - order take out? Cannot fault the staff, they are doing the best they can but the hotel needs to take a long hard look at itself. At the very least they should tell you when you check in there is no food at the Inn."

The window opened slightly but the hotel faces on to a main road and there was a lot of building works going on around the hotel so we were unable to leave the window open for any period of time. The breakfast was very poor quality and the bed was terribly uncomfortable.

Overall, not really what we were expecting for the price paid and the fact that it is a Hilton branded hotel. Add on to that the cost of £16 for a nights parking and it was unfortunately a huge let down. We would not stay here again, there are so many better choices in Bristol."

I greatly appreciated his professionalism and compassion. Well done Peter. Hotel is nice, clean, comfortable bed, close to buses and shops."
268,Chariotchoogle,2022-07-31,"Another Great weekend In Bristol Got off to a bad start, air conditioning was kaput a trickle of hot air in a room that probably hadn’t cooled down from the hottest temperatures on record, the first night of four night stay was horrendous. However the hotel did sort it pretty quickly once reported and the remainder of our stay was pretty comfortable.
Forth time staying here, perfect place for a break, close to the train station, bus routes to Bath and Wells, and a ten minute walk in to town, perfect location.
Rooms have everything you need, iron, safe and fridge, great comfy bedding and super shower. Room cleaning seems back to normal, immaculately cleaned every day.
Staff are super friendly, always polite and professional.
Breakfast is pretty good, everything you need, great coffee, and now a waffle making machine which was a treat. Nice bar area to have a pre going out drink especially on the terrace outside.
Would have got 5 stars if it wasn’t for the air conditioning, but it became a distant memory and once again the Hilton added to another great weekend break in Bristol, thank you, see you in 2023."
269,padsmcginty62,2022-07-31,"Got off to a shaky start. This was the fourth time we have used this hotel and when we tried to enter our allocated room the key cards wouldn't work and then when we entered the room we were immediately hit by the heat. The air conditioning was on and I put it on the lowest setting and then we went out. When we arrived back the room was boiling so obviously the air conditioning wasn't working. We had a dreadful night's sleep so much so that I went down at 6am to complain. We went to Wells for the day and when we came back a maintenance guy was just finishing repairing the air conditioning. Our thanks to him and after that we had no further problems with the temperature. Also there was no TV remote but someone from housekeeping sorted us out with one later that day.
Everything else was fine and it would have been a 5 star review if it wasn't for the issue with the air conditioning."
270,rakanmired,2022-07-31,Pleasant stay at the hotel Had everything I needed and was within walking distance from the center. The staff were very friendly and the food at the restaurant was decent. The room itself was just right and was ready as soon as I arrived.
271,HullPhil,2022-07-31,"Great hotel really close to the train station I stayed here for one night and really enjoyed it. Check in was very efficient with a nice friendly guy and I was in my room in no time. I was on the 5th floor and I couldn’t hear any noise from outside. The room was typical Garden Inn but I did think it was a bit smaller than other Garden Inn’s I’ve been in. It wasn’t really an issue though. 

Breakfast next morning was well organised and the guy on the egg station was superb, really friendly and chatty. A real credit to the hotel.

Overall, I really liked this hotel and would recommend."
272,beaconoutbound16,2022-05-31,"Noisy hotel, rock hard bed Front desk staff hit and miss. The lady named Brittany was really friendly but the older gentleman in the suit spoke to us in a condescending and grumpy manner. During the first night the air conditioning kept switching itself off, making the room uncomfortably hot. The next morning we went down to the front desk to ask for it to be repaired, and whilst there asked for our room to be made up by housekeeping. Said grumpy man then steps in (despite not talking to him), seems annoyed and starts actually lecturing us on how the hotel is now back to “full service” and that our room will automatically get cleaned by housekeeping as long as the do not disturb sign is not hung up. He kept repeating this over and over again, practically forcing me to apologise for disturbing the front desk before he got off his high horse. 

So we took him at his demeaning word, and the next day did not stop by the front desk to request housekeeping. We come back at the end of the day to find our room has not been made up by housekeeping despite the do not disturb sign being off our door when we vacated the room for the day at around noon. Annoying. 

The room itself does have a fridge, but other than that is small and pretty basic in terms of furnishings. Super powerful shower. Beds are rock-hard, as other reviewers have noted. Housekeeping staff were pretty noisy (chatting, shouting down their phones, clanking, and continually slamming doors shut of the rooms they’re cleaning), waking us up every morning during our stay.

Beware if you go for a (more expensive) “park view” room that there is a building directly opposite which has demolition work ongoing, with the associated noises. 

Final note; there are EV charging points, but these were occupied by non-EV vehicles every night."
273,26lucyc,2022-07-31,"Perfect Location and warm welcoming staff Stayed here a night before office and already booked my next visit back.

Great value for money in terms of quality of accommodation and staff friendliness. Location was exactly where I needed and only 25 min walk from Cabot Tower which i highly recommend going up for brilliant views. The room I had originally picked wasn't quite ready so they offered to move me into a different room (507). Lots of space in hotel room and mattress was great for a good night sleep. Room was also extremely clean and staff obviously took a lot of care. 

Only one downside is that there wasn't a TV remote in room to be able to watch Wimbledon. Went down to front desk and they sorted me straight out and found me a remote.  

Can't fault a single thing."
274,Stormy10x,2022-06-30,"Business trip Stayed two nights in this hotel for work.  I usually stay in a different hotel which is much more expensive so I tried this one for a change. The staff were fantastic, nothing was too much trouble and just so friendly.  The hotel was spotless, comfortable and had everything I would hope for in the room.  The hotel is in a perfect location for the train station and the restaurants on the river.  I will definitely be using this hotel again."
275,Stickleback,2022-06-30,"Good Location + Fantastic Staff + Probably Avoid Breakfast Hotel is well located and within walking distance of exploring the city centre. My room was modern and clean but quite small.

Parking outside hotel cost £16 for 24 hr period.

I have to congratulate manager regarding his staff...... everyone was extremely pleasant, cheerful and professional..... as it should be. It really does make a difference. 

My only gripe would be the breakfast. I did not book breakfast in advance as I was not sure how I would be feeling in the morning. Breakfast booked in advance is £9.99, however, if you go in on the morning it is charged at £14. I have had better breakfasts at other Hilton Garden Inns..... breakfast would be okay for £9.99..... it is overpriced at £14."
276,foodiefromlondon20,2022-06-30,"Very clean, comfortable and peaceful 🛏 One night stay, located about 5 min walk from the station. Staff were fantastic, room was clean and comfortable.

277,116hazelb,2022-06-30,"Convenient, clean and comfortable Excellent standard of hotel as you would expect from a Hilton.  Good choice of breakfast.   Competitive menu in restaurant with good choices.  Rooms well stocked and comfortable and clean.  Friendly staff."
278,sallywC6150MZ,2022-05-31,"Average Reception staff just robotic, not many smiles and the grumpy guy on reception in the morning doesn't even ask if everything was ok when you check out.

Restaurant - food ok in parts but fish looks sub standard quality and very bony. Check if there are any coach parties due in as about 20ish people descend all of a sudden and take over the seating area.

Room - ok, a little small as was the bathroom but toiletries nice and seemed clean. Asked for more milk and was offered the box to take however many I needed, unlike some places that give you a measly 4.

Overall, I wouldn't rule out staying again, maybe just consider other dining options - oh and they add a service charge too which I personally loathe, I always leave a tip but dislike being dictated how much."
279,Cheshireladyontour,2022-06-30,"Avoid ground floor rooms too noisy. I had room 2 which was near the gym, toilets and staff office. I found there was too much corridor noise. Can control temperature in room , but rather than program a temperature is just higher or lower which is a bit hit and miss if you arrive late at night ."
280,NeilC2607,2022-06-30,"bathroom tight squeeze Reception:
Pleasent and very helpful efficient staff

Room / facilities:
Room number 528 is on the 5th floor and is clean with a green park view,  the room contains a queen bed, 4 pillows (none of which were to my liking), hanging area, small bar fridge, safe, iron and board, tea and coffee facilities, desk and chair and single chair. The room is cosy and the bathroom is very cramped and poorly designed.
We had house keeping knock on our door at 8.30am, when she was aware we were to check out (but had not yet) and were due to check out by 11.00am.

Another staff member was in the lift as it arrived on our floor.  She quickly tried to close the door before we could enter the lift.

The room does have self control air conditioning with a window that opens 3 cm.

Laundry: 
Self service coin laundry with 1 washers and 1 dryers costing £1.20 per wash and dry is  £0.20 per 12 mins 

Parking:
Parking is plentiful for about 30 cars and costs £16 per night. Car registration is required at checkin. 
We arrived back to the hotel at 3.30pm after a day out, and there was only 2 car spaces left (seperate to the 3 electric car charge stations).  Having paid a hefty price for parking and to not be able to find park, is unacceptable.  The hotel staff confirmed that the hotel does over book car parking to the level where cars park in non designated car spaces, and almost lock other vehicles in.

Wifi:
Complementary and good speed. No validation or password required.

Breakfast:
Available for additional cost, but not utilised on this stay.

Conclusion:
Great location and staff, close to city centre.

Letdowns:
Small bathroom, possibility of not having a car park upon your return in the afternoon/evening, window that does not open more.

Location / Nearby:
Bristol city and all its offerings are a close 10 min stroll.
Tesco express market and Pret a Manger coffee within a 4 minute walk.

Beware:
No matter where you drive to, payment for parking is required. Most parking meters accept coin and card “tap” facilities. Generally after 6.00pm or 8.00pm parking is free, in designated locations.

Getting to hotel:
Best use GPS"
281,O6983MXelizabetha,2022-05-31,"Cannot fault this hotel We were on a coach trip staying overnight at the Hilton Garden Inn. I arrived at around 5.00 p.m. and our driver went in to check us all in. Some rooms weren't ready so we were all invited to go into the bar for a complimentary drink until we could go to our rooms..  The dinner which was served buffet style for our coach party only, and was excellent with a good choice on the menu.  My room was quite chilly on arrival due to the air conditioning and I couldn't change it. I spoke to Reception and asked if they could switch it off.   They were very apologetic and said they would do that and would I like a heater delivered to my room? Or, if I preferred I could change rooms.   I was quite happy to just have it turned off.  However, after dinner I was in my room when a very nice young lady delivered a heater in case I needed it and again, offered to change my room which I declined.  Breakfast was again buffet style with plenty of choice.  All the staff were absolutely lovely and extremely helpful.  We went out for a walk in the evening and the situation of the hotel is quite nice with a park opposite and you are not far from the river.  I would certainly recommend this hotel and once again a big thank you to the lovely staff."
282,888Wendyj,2022-05-31,"Good location & nice rooms but don’t bother with breakfast Good location 10 mi. Walk from waterfront, check in staff very friendly & efficient but had the worst breakfast experience and not what I expected af this level of hotel - di yourself a favour & don’t bother with a very overpriced breakfast thats more than disappointing"
283,richandliz28,2022-03-31,"Comfortable stay Chosen for location as much as anything, we enjoyed a comfortable stay here for a short break. Check in and out was straightforward. Easy access to the city centre, the trains at Temple Meads and a bus stop is just outside - very convenient to get to Clifton suspension bridge. The room was pretty average and had everything we needed for a few nights, and the restaurant downstairs served up a decent lunch. We didn't have breakfast there. Car parking was easy and convenient, and seemed fairly priced compared to nearby public car parks."
284,1959robin820,2022-05-31,Excellent value and great staff Great location just by Temple Mead Station and a short walk to the 'bright lights of Bristol'  Staff are very helpful especially the gentleman behind the front desk who helped us get a taxi on the 'wet' graduation day.   Staff at the bar especially the young lady who put in the hours there were very personable and helpful.  Breakfast was plentiful and freshly cooked.    Highly recommend this mid priced hotel

A hostel under the name of Hilton Nothing to like, 1 star hotel under the name of Hilton.Bad management.Very rude receprionist.No securised Wifi, dirty room, 1 shower gel for 2 pers., bed on wheels like in the hospital, no controlled AC, only ventilation full of bacterias.Stay away!"

The food was gorgeous and plenty of it, starter, main and pudding all lovely had evening meal and breakfast again lots of choice from cereal to full English and tea/coffee and juices. Got to say if I were down that way again I would stay there."
289,chelseapeter25,2022-04-30,"Our Favourite Hotel My partner and I chose this hotel for our April 'just because' stay and it was brilliant. We got a discount for signing up to the Hilton Honours programme directly on their website, making it £253 for 3 nights, which we were happy to pay. Not only was the good price one of our main reasons for choosing it, but also because the location was fantastic. We downloaded the app and were given the opportunity to check in the day before, as well as having easy access to lists of facilities and recommendations etc. 

Upon our arrival, we used the app to check-in early and choose a room, but unfortunately the room we picked wasn't available as it was yet to be cleaned (note we got there at 12, when check-in is 3!). They gave us the choice of them picking another random room, or for us to come back later, which was what we did. They looked after our luggage for a few hours whilst we went to explore. When we came back to check in, our room still wasn't available due to maintenance so they gave us an alternative. The staff member who organised this was incredibly helpful and spent a long time going over a map of Bristol with us, giving various recommendations. 

When we got to the room (second floor), we were pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious, clean and well-stocked with facilities. The bed was a good size, with the TV directly across from it. The room was well lit despite being next to a building on the other side of the road. Everything felt premium quality. The bed was a little hard but we both slept well every night we were there. The only issue we encountered in the room was the TV; the time set on the TV was different to the actual time, meaning the TV guide was completely out of sync and unusable. Although this was a hassle, we were able to use the Freeview TV guide on their website instead to match everything up, so it wasn't a disaster, more an inconvenience. 

Our location was absolutely fantastic. As it is tucked away, it is not too noisy and you get a pleasant walk through the park when going into the centre. On the other side of the hotel there is a bus stop that goes directly to the zoo. It's only a 15 minute max walk into the centre and it is pleasant any time of day. You walk past so many food places on the way and Tescos etc, so you're always able to be well stocked. 

We could not fault our stay. I would have said 4.8 instead of 5 to account for the TV issue but as this was not an option and I feel so positively about our experience, a 5 point rating seems the most appropriate score. If it weren't for us trying new places, we would definitely return to the hotel! Perhaps in future if we feel we want to experience the same quality as we did for our short trip. All staff we encountered were fantastic and we felt safe and comfortable there. It was the ideal hotel for our first trip to Bristol."
290,Hilary14,2022-04-30,"Ideal for train station We stayed here because of its proximity to Bristol Temple Meads station. It is very clean, warm and quiet considering it is on the main road. The breakfast was good with plenty of choice. The main asset of the hotel was the staff, who were very helpful.friendly and efficient."
291,Jaybsunny,2022-03-31,"Excellent mini break in Bristol Stayed here for three nights recently with friends.  Really handy for walking from the station. 

 All of the staff were polite, smiley and helpful.  The hotel is very clean, and we loved the outside area for early evening drinks in the sunshine.

Although it didnt spoil our stay, the beds creak every time you move, and the ensuite is a little tight for space.   

Other than those minor issues, we had a lovely mini break here.  Would definitely stay again."

Staff very helpful.  Did not eat at the hotel.  We used the nearby council car park.  Free for guests 18.00-08.00 and £1.50 per hour outside of those times (max stay 4 hours).  Very good base to explore Bristol."

Gluten free bread and cereals are available if required. 

The only downside was that you can't plug yr firestick into the TV as they are bolted to the wall, but not a big issue as I used my tablet instead. 

Would def stay again"
294,337michaelm,2022-03-31,"The hotel that exceeds all expectations Wow, having stayed in Hilton’s and other brands extensively throughout the difficult times over the last 2 years this hotel gets better and better.

This was by far my best stay over the last 2 years, all the staff are amazing starting with Annie checking me in.

It was great to meet the new reception manager Alex and Juan who went out of their way to make me feel welcome throughout the week.

The rooms aren’t massive but very comfy but are plenty big enough for 2 people and copious room for working with all the amenities you need. But they have a great bathroom and the rooms and hotel are spotless!

The food at Breakfast and Dinner has only got better and better with the lovely David and Karla and Mario and the chefs who assist when needed treating their guests with abundance of energy and warmth.

My check out by Peter was excellent as always and worked like clockwork.

The lovely patio area is starting to fill as the days get warmer.

A special shout out to the young cleaner on the 2nd floor who went out of her way to say good morning and asking how my stay was, this was a first and started my day off in a great mood - Thank you.

For the first time it was great to see the hotel practice their fire evacuation and this seemed very smooth with no issues.

Thank you for another great stay to all of you and look forward to seeing you soon."
295,biddyandbuster,2022-03-31,"Good hotel, staff and facilities, Hard bed One of the best chain hotels I have stayed in for room facilities, and cleanliness.
 
Liked · There was a warm and genuine welcome from Bailey at reception, and we given all the info we needed on breakfast / dining and checkout etc. Reception was filled with the most wonderful fragrance too.
The room was immaculately clean, very well laid out with plenty of storage. Having a fridge was a real benefit too for milk and cold drinks.
Although compact the bathroom had a good sized shower. I was delighted to see that there was magnifying mirror installed, and the heated mirror was a great feature.
Breakfast was good and plentiful, but the evening meal was ok but nothing special.
Staff throughout were lovely.

Disliked · The only thing that would prevent me from staying again is the fact that the bed was very uncomfortable for me. Too hard and very creaky. It is shame really as everything else was perfect."
296,ronanbarton,2022-03-31,"Perfect if the price is right! I stayed at this property for a Friday afternoon/evening out in Bristol. 

This hotel was located a 7 mins walk from Temple Meads Train Station and about 7 mins from the City centre and 20 minutes from the Dockyard area. 

I had room 421, which was a 1 King Bed Standard room. The hotel is basic and perfectly formed with a great use of space. The decor was starting to show its age. The bathroom had an average pressure shower with the weirdest door I had seen.  

The bed was comfortable, although nothing to get to excited about. The Room could do with a slight modernisation with new carpets being laid. 

Summary - I would stay here again for the room rate I secured. Although would look to stay at another Hilton next time."

Warm welcome at the front desk. Was my first time at this hilton and Peter took the time to Map out directions to the location of  my meeting.

The room was exceptionally clean and well maintained.    

I also had a gorgeous view of the park.

The icing on the cake was how well Peter at the front desk looked after me during my stay at checkin, during my stay and checkout.

I am a frequent traveller on business and will ensure this particular Hilton will be my hotel of choice when in Bristol. 

Already reserved for April."
298,JulieS408,2022-02-28,"Very Nearly Perfect I stay in many hotels for work purposes, this hotel was very nearly perfect.
Clean, quiet, modern and with aspects that you don’t realise are a blessing. Plug socket next to the bed head, comfortable pillows, one larger bedside table, great toiletries including sanitising wipes, no stray hairs from previous customers (this is my number 1 put off)
Each floor has a beautiful fragrance, which is immediately noticeable, fabulous dinner, very tasty (I had Salmon) and a good breakfast.
One tiny shortfall, lasting impressions etc, when I checked out the male receptionist asked for my room card and that was it, no ‘how was your stay’ not even a ‘goodbye’, so even though I had a fabulous experience at this hotel, I wasn’t going to tell him, as he couldn’t care less."

The bed was super comfy and the fridge was especially helpful. I will always stay at this location when traveling to or through Bristol."
300,NikhilR548,2022-02-28,Weekend getaway to Bristol Me and my wife booked the Hilton Garden Inn during our recent visit to Bristol. The hotel is conveniently located close to the station and it ticked all the right boxes. We had booked a king room overlooking the park and a special mention Ms. Elena at the front desk who was very helpful to give us all the info about the city and things to do. She also helped with moving our rooms when the heating wasn't working properly and went above and beyond in offering personalized service and care. We also didn't miss an opportunity to grab drinks at the bar and Ms. Carla made us lovely drinks throughout our stay. I would also like to thank Peter who gave us local recommendations of restaurants and things to do and places to see in Bristol. On the whole it was a lovely trip and the team at Hilton truly made it a memorable stay. Looking forward to visit Bristol and stay at the Hilton next time.
301,Man1cmom,2022-02-28,"Disappointing stay Firstly, the hotel is quite difficult to find with lots of construction work going on. Then, despite getting there at 3, the time people check out, the car park was full. It’s very tight too. You can park on the car park opposite but then would have to move your car at 8am as there’s no return. So, we parked on the (expensive) NCP car park round the corner.

Check in - there were 2 ladies on the desk checking in 1 person whose reservation couldn’t be found. We were left waiting which shouldn’t have happened. However, once served they were polite and friendly.

Room - used a base only. Appearances were good and adequate for our needs. We were 2nd floor road facing and experienced no noise at all, very peaceful. Which is why it is a shame the bed was just so uncomfortable! It was 2 singles pushed together and they dipped in the middle. Not what we expected.

We wouldn’t stay again due to the car park issues and u comfy bed."
302,Go01341633536,2022-02-28,"Poor visit We arrived to our night away for it to be a complete disaster. We are given our room key, when we went to our room we found it already taken by other guests. Not only had you provided us with this, you’d exposed someone’s possessions by giving out more keys to their room! We went back down to reception to complain to be told ‘we’ve given you the wrong room’ there was no effort made by staff to try and turn our stay around into a good experience."
303,DarrenL225,2022-01-31,"Lovely place with very friendly staff I am a huge fan of Hilton Hotels, i always stay in them if they are available where I am travelling to.  There were 6 of us staying down in Bristol for a night and we all decided to stay here.  All of us thought it was a great hotel.  Nice location with a short walk to the station and to the old town.  The staff were friendly and helpful and, as always with a Hilton, the bed made for a great nights kip.  Breakfast was good, but I have had better at other Hiltons, with a very wide choice.  All in all a great place to stay."
304,JayandLuke2007,2021-11-30,"Good location and great breakfasts Nice location, very close to the main station once you know your way around and cut through the business area.  Some local facilities around, again more so where the offices are i.e. restaurants and pubs. 
Nice hotel, rooms are small and bed was ok, bit hard for my liking.  Fairly noisy and one criticism was the cleaning staff were very loud in the morning talking loudly at each other down the corridors so don't bet on a lay in. 
They had amazing breakfast selections however and excellent coffee."

306,rachaelt684,2021-12-31,"Birthday weekend away for Hubby ! I booked a two night stay for my husbands birthday. 
Checking in was easy and parking in the hotel car park was an additional cost but worth it if you can get in. 
We had a room on the 4th floor and asked for one over looking the garden to the rear of the hotel. This would certainly have been quieter than overlooking the ring road. 
Rooms were very comfortable with fridge, safe, tea and coffee along with toiletries in the en-suite bathroom. 
We did have a few drinks in the bar which was very Covid safe and in these strange times we felt comfortable doing so. 
On our first evening we also ate in the hotel restaurant as we had an evening organised walk to attend. 
It’s proximity to the city centre, waters edge and many restaurants made this a great choice hotel."

The room was clean and quiet. The breakfast, served till 11 at weekends, provided an excellent selection of hot and cold food, which set us up for the day. There was a relaxed yet efficient atmosphere, with no queuing or overcrowding.
Luggage storage and a 12 o'clock checkout were a bonus. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful, and we hope to return to explore the city further."

Beth did an amazing Cocktail refreshing with passionfruit and always smiling.
Mario was there to attend to any of our requests.
Great stay and i would book again."
312,Keeplookingforplaces,2021-11-30,"Lovely weekend seeing Bristol & catching up with family. Love this hotel it’s the best in Bristol. Happy friendly staff, it’s clean & comfortable it’s also very busy which makes you realise just how hard the staff work but still maintain the standard. It’s a short walk from Bristol Temple Meads Train Station  into the reception & if you leave by opposite side then the walk into town is just a few minutes before you get to the centre of Bristol and the nightlife. Really can’t wait to go again."
313,imcwh,2021-11-30,"Great stay with Hilton standards. Stayed for two nights with room overlooking the street and never heard and traffic noise. Room was wonderful and spotless apart from damage obviously done by previous guests. Staff on reception were very friendly as we're those I the restaurant. They did a wonderful job clearing (and sanitising) the tables as well as topping up the buffet. The food was in such demand it couldn't possibly get cold. Nice enough location. Five minutes from train station. Bars and Tesco five minutes the other direction.
Won't be going back to Bristol but would recommend this hotel to others."
314,karenrW8407CJ,2021-11-30,"Nice stay We stayed for two nights, check in was very easy. We used JustPark so didn't experience the hotel carpark. 
Room was ok, overlooking the derelict building at the rear. 
Fridge was a bonus as we could have proper milk rather than the provided uht cartons.
Missed breakfast fist morning, but made it on the second morning. It was a little cold and hash browns the were in an enclosed serving dish so not crispy! 
The manager was rather rude to a member of staff because the coffee machine was broken-it wasn't her fault but his attitude was not professional, also he was wearing jeans and trainers and an open topped shirt, no tie....not what i would expect from a Hilton manager. 
Would stay again but probably skip the expense of breakfast."
315,Cromwell32,2021-11-30,"Very good apart from the breakfast Stayed here for one night. Staff were very friendly and helpful despite the hotel being very busy. They even gave us a room away from the large groups that were staying there. Room was a good size and comfortable. Would recommend a garden view over the park behind the hotel. Hotel is easy to get to by car and train. It's away from the noise of the city centre but only a 10-12 minute walk in to reach the the old port, shops and bars. Has its own parking although spaces are quite limited. Good price of £120 including breakfast- although that was the one disappointment. The bacon was barely cooked and my wife said her mushrooms were tasteless and the baked beans were cold. The fruit salad was basically apple, so good if you like apple. My hash brown was also cold. It was not the worst we've had but far from the best. Despite this I would still recommend this hotel for a friendly, pleasant stay with easy access to a day in Bristol at a decent price."
316,ACP66,2021-11-30,"Will stay again Extremely friendly reception team, and resolved the parking issue to our relief (Hilton car park was full. Directed to directly adjacent pay & display which was free from 6:00pm - 8:00am for Hilton Guests  - then Ringo App to simply book from 8:00am)
Lovely room...not the biggest we have been in for this sort of hotel, but very well proportioned. Very happy with the shower / bathroom / bed / facilities...and extremely clean ! 
Found breakfast to be way ahead of similar hotels. Again staff so friendly. Eggs were being cooked to order, food replenished all the time, and the ambience of the restaurant was so relaxing and pleasant.
Close to shopping areas and directly by the train station. Can't think of anywhere better to stay in a mid-budget hotel if you are after a night or two in Bristol. Will definitely stay here again.
Had a 5th floor park view room. Will ask for this again.
Thanks to all the staff...and especially Zoe on reception who gave us an unsuspected surprise when we booked in (thought she knew our son...but say no more !!) You were all so friendly and helpful."
317,AndrewL729,2021-11-30,"Hilton money, just not Hilton standards Check in was great, but downhill from then. Room was very tired and basic, seats stained and mould on the shower sealant. Bed was like sleeping on a sheet plywood. Went down for breakfast, eggs overcooked and no ketchup. I was also surprised that one of the managers was putting the eggs on, not a chef or someone appropriately dressed."
318,PMack19991968,2021-11-30,"Exceptional customer service. Elena was on hand to ensure the smoothest possible check in for our entire tour party and all the staff helped us out with our Tour Coach parking. Again, very high standards of customer service. Thank you!"
319,K8495MZamandac,2021-11-30,"Mini break. Driving to this hotel was not a problem. Very easy as was access back towards the m4. Was able to park on site which was great though the £16 for 24 hours is a bit steep though. 
Reception area clean and welcoming as was the staff. We arrived ahead of Check in. They happily stored out luggage and gave us a map of the local area which was very helpful as everything was in walking distance.
We walked 10minutes to Cabot Circus which had a lovely array of top end and budget friendly shops.
The room was the cleanest we have stayed in, in a long time. It also smelt clean. Spacious with a good view on the 5th floor. 
Fabulous shower.
We had a meal booked in the evening at San Carlo which I 100 per cent recommend but be warned its not cheap.  Reception called us a taxi with no fuss.
As always ypu never get the same nights sleep in a different bed to your own and this was the case with the bed here. It wasn't uncomfortable and did sleep without discomfort. Very soft bed with two very soft pillows. Comfortable temperature in the room also.
Breakfast was included in our stay and WOW!!!!!!! 
There is something there for everyone. 
Cereals, fresh fruit, Buffet full English, continental, make ypur own waffles, tea and coffee aswell as fresh juices. 
I had a waffle with bacon and scrambled egg, and the hubby had a full English.
Wonderful.
Will definitely be booking here again aswell as recommended to others.
Thank You Hilton."
320,769judyw,2021-10-31,"Great service,very clean room and plenty kf storage Peter on reception was superb ...he not only made sure we had immediate access to room  on arrival ,so we could get ready for a party ,but booked us a cab ! ...and he bought us a newspaper on both days and learnt us an umbrella! I Have never known such good service from a receptionist in an English hotel.
The hotel was very clean an d facilities were good"
321,eamono190,2021-10-31,"Pleasant, comfortable stay to visit the city Spent 2 nights here over half term. We were happy with everything, clean, comfortable room, nice showers, decent size TV. Clean and tidy throughout the hotel. Friendly help staff. As per other reviews there isn’t much around the hotel. Cabot’s shopping however is about 7 minute walk. There is a Starbucks about 5 min walk just by the station. Generally good value for money all in all. Would stay here again."
322,stujay2,2021-10-31,"Happy Hilton Hotel Fabulous two night stay!
A welcoming clean and friendly Hotel and in an excellent location.
Check in was very quick and easy.
Very knowledgeable reception staff, especially Peter, who can advise on almost everything in the local area, buses etc..
The room was very clean and the bathroom offered a fabulous shower. 
Facilities in the room were plentiful to allow a very pleasant stay.
We only stayed bed and breakfast but I have to say it was  just perfect with a vast array of food options and they accommodate well for the GLUTEN FREE diner. 
The dining area is very well kept, clean and a calm atmosphere and luckily with very helpful cheerful staff.
Will happily stay again and definitely recommend.
Thank you to all involved in making our stay memorable for all the right reasons."
323,stewartc191,2021-10-31,"Fantastic stay - excellent location This hotel exceeded my expectations. Checked in on a Friday night for 3 nights on a trip from Aberdeen with friends. Cherry is an absolute super star. She should be a poster girl for Hilton. Her service and attention to guests was absolutely second to none. Nothing was too much of a problem for her and when she saw us in the bar during the weekend she would come and chat to us all. Really nice room but hotels need to stop with the COVID excuse now and do housekeeping every day, not on request. Carla in the bar was another excellent member of staff. Friendly and professional. The hotel is a stone’s throw from Temple Meads so in a great location. I would highly recommend this hotel and will be booking it next time I’m in Bristol."
324,bcfc1876,2021-10-31,"Great on so many level but just a few minor details ..... Great on so many level but just a few minor details let it down
Still great and worth a stay
Staff excellent, so often forgotten and overlooked, but the staff was excellent.
Room, roomy, clean and quite.
Great location.
The only down side, perhaps been picky, was door handles in the room missing some door 'Roses' and sink basin overflow dirty"
325,Lala042016,2021-10-31,"Lovely hotel with great staff We were a party of four who found a great deal for this hotel. The hotel was very clean (still following covid cleaning with high standards), the beds comfy and the staff were amazing. The restaurant staff and their manager were very friendly, attentive and went out their way to meet your needs. We felt very welcome and the food was delicious. We never waited for service. We would definitely recommend."
326,El-Yuca-Ingles,2021-09-30,"Fine for a short stay Somehow I was less impressed with this property than I had expected to be, although there was noting major wrong with it. I found the room to be rather small and poorly laid out, with the armchair a nuisance since there was not enough space for it. Comfortable bed and nice shower. Very nice welcome when I arrived. Good breakfast and adequate internet. Well located near to Temple Meads and the city center. I'd stay again if needed."
327,A3918SRpeterm,2021-10-31,"Wonderful stay Very good hotel in a convenient location in Bristol City Centre . Spotless room , handy fridge and plenty of toiletries.  Only slight issue was on the 2nd morning as the breakfast sausages were unfortunately very  undercooked . Spoke to one member of staff who did nothing , repeated our concerns to another staff member who took them away and offered us some freshly cooked  ones . Would definitely stay again and a special mention to Cherry on reception who was outstanding."
328,chillipepper23,2021-10-31,"Clean and comfortable hotel Our room was as expected, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good. All the staff were friendly and helpful. A special mention for Peter on reception. His exceptional customer service was brilliant.."
329,Boole89,2021-10-31,"Parking disaster Called the day before and was told parking was fine and there is space usually - ""never known it to be full but there is another parking spot near it"". Got there and hilton parking is full + cars waiting in the car park. Parked across the road but had to leave by 12pm as its short term parking, which ruined the trip. 

They must be well aware as thry had pre printed instructions on how to pay at the other parking area (max 4 hours). You need to pay at 8am to ensure you are not fined/towed. This parking was also full by 10pm.

Wish they would have been honest as when we spoke to the receptionist on arrival she said parking is full after 6pm and on weekends. 

Very disappointed"
330,Stevie390,2021-09-30,"Comfortable city centre hotel The Hilton Garden Inn is in a convenient location a few minutes’ walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station. It’s well located for the commercial district, but about 10-15 minutes’ walk from the main tourist and shopping areas of central Bristol and so feels a little detached from most eating and entertainment places. A bus goes directly from outside the building towards Clifton village and Bristol Zoo. The hotel seems to have plenty of car parking.

The room was a decent size and had ample storage space, desk, fridge, safe, coffee/tea and comfortable bed. The wifi was good and sufficient for video streaming. My room had a pleasant view over the Temple Gardens to the rear of the building and the city skyline beyond. I’d recommend rooms with that rear view, as the road to the front is quite busy.

The hotel offered a full self-service buffet of pre-Covid standards – full English hot and cold food, cereals, pastries, juices, etc. The staff were helpful and friendly in the restaurant, which also served evening meals. There’s also a small marketplace selling drinks and snacks.

Overall, this hotel won’t dazzle and isn’t in the heart of the action, but it is comfortable and offers a pleasant stay. It’s a good base for a weekend break in this interesting and attractive city. I was happy with it."
331,88aye,2021-09-30,"Lovely staff, nice room, perfectly pleasant all round, just be aware the hotel is a little out of the centre! Lovely staff, I didn’t really make any additional requests  but it seemed that nothing was too much for them and they were friendly. Room was nice, breakfast good too. I’d stay here again if I ever returned to Bristol but for the location, it’s a little out of the centre!"
332,paulhA4628NZ,2021-09-30,"Great staff. But not enough of them  I will clearly state that the staff are excellent and lovely. However, the hotel is under staffed. Therefore a very lo g wait with others to check in. Went to eat in the evening and an hour to get food (apparently under staffed kitche) and when it arrived it was under cooked chicken. They did the right thing, as I said the staff were great but I then had to find somewhere else to eat at 21:00 (rather than wait a further hour for food) when all I wanted to do was go to my room. Not a pleasurable stay"
333,Gramlx,2021-09-30,"Top Bristol hotel Very nice hotel, we here just one night for work, had dinner which was very good buffet offering 3 starters 3 mains and 3 deserts, excellent room great size and very clean great staff. Breakfast was great as much as you coukd eat and everything you coukd thing of well worth staying here"
334,Travel65055746341,2021-09-30,Over night stay Lovely hotel breakfast very nice all staff welcoming and friendly room very clean nice location but a lot of road works to get to it which didn’t cause a problem didn’t experience the evening meals as we ate out I would stay here again if I came up to Bristol
335,katymcb123,2021-08-31,"Helpful and hospitable - ideal Staff were great from start to finish. Popped out to check the parking situation as we were approaching, and quick to change our room to a double when it appeared we’d miserably booked a twin. 
Location is a short walk to Harbourside.
Hotel is immaculately clean and all felt very covid safe."
336,elpasho,2021-08-31,"Hilton 👎 The restaurant menu was the same all week, we waited 30 mins to get our food, it was cold when it finally did come.... I was practically forced to pay for the amount over my company meal allowance  each night, I refused & said it'll be paid in full when I check out.. they then kept calling my room, been a night worker not a good move.. the front glass windows were filthy.. if this hotel is the standard for all Hiltons then I would be ashamed."
337,asb2003,2021-08-31,"Not quite 5 stars, but a pleasant and comfortable stay Staff were very helpful when we had a problem with strong smell in the room. Peter and Jamie were especially approachable and professional in dealing with the matter.

Breakfast was very good, with usual selection + a waffle machine, continental, pastries, various seeds and dried fruits etc.

Bar service was substandard, and were twice told that ingredients for our drinks had run out. The hot chocolate made from hot water and instant powder, and served spilt without a tissue, not drinkable. All 4 drinks served separately with long wait times. No complaint due to the fact that we were using complimentary drinks vouchers, but as paying customers would've been rightfully annoyed.

Location was superb, just a short walk from Old City and City Centre, and the reception area was pleasant, with the fruity water provided throughout the day being a nice touch. Rooms and bathrooms were small and lacked some amenities for Hilton standard, and the housekeeping staff seemed unwilling to return a smile, but generally rooms were clean and sufficient and A/C was fantastic."
338,337michaelm,2021-08-31,"A very warm welcome As always greeted by The reception team fantastically. The Feds are comfy and large enough for my requirements with the ac keeping the room to required temperature.

Dinner was lovely and apart from the peas the fish and chips was one of the best I have had! The new restaurant staff are coping well and try to interact with the staff.

Breakfast wow what a choice continental and full English, eggs cooked fresh as required.

Thank you for a lovely stay, keep up the hard work during these difficult times!"
339,carolineEd25,2021-08-31,"Good hotel  Very clean hotel, comfy bedrooms and lovely food. Breakfast is buffet and even has a make your own waffle maker. Staff were very helpful especially reception staff. Only 10 minute walk into the old city"
340,MeganWozencroft,2021-08-31,"Very nice! Really nice stay! Would definitely go back. The room was very comfortable, quiet & clean! The walls could potentially do with a fresh kick of paint, but not a big issue. The staff were friendly & the place as a whole was very tidy & fresh.  Definitely get what you pay for !"
341,841darrens,2021-08-31,"Slow…… Everything is just slow slow slow. Staff had to physically go to my room before I could check in as no one knew if it was ready. To get served for food is a nightmare. It has definitely gone downhill from my last stay in 2020.
That said the room are clean, tidy and fit for purpose."
342,Chrisaudu,2021-08-31,"Room had an offensive smell Checked into a room with an offensive smell. It took in excess of an hour to get a room change and we ended up far away from our kids (14 & 8) after the room change. 
Overall experience was grossly disappointing."
343,mfranks911,2021-07-31,"Comfortable Stay, clean and bright rooms and friendly staff A typical non-descript modern building from the outside the Hilton Garden Inn is very convenient for Temple Meads station (just a five minute stroll) and a little further from the harbour's lively facilities and the Town Centre, all in all around fifteen minutes walk from Central Boulelvard.

Once inside the modern theme continued and we had a very friendly greeting on checking in and our room was ready although we were a little early.

Our room (510) on the top floor was overlooking Temple Gardens and was quiet (probably much more so than rooms on the main road side), bright and modern with all the amenities expected for a City break. It looked as if it had been refurbished quite recently and everything was neat and tidy and the bathroom had an excellent shower. With a fridge, safe and tea and coffee making facilities  facilities it had all you might really need.

The bed was extremely comfortable although the room was not that large but ideal as a base.

The lifts were efficient and breakfast was taken on the ground floor restaurant and with lovely weather it was possible to eat on the outside terrace. It was so nice to be able to go back to having a breakfast buffet and people were being sensible all round. We did not eat in the hotel at lunch or dinner as there are so many excellent restaurants in this charming City.

The Hilton Garden Inn is an ideal place for a short stay break in Bristol and we would not hesitate in staying again if we are in town again."
344,Peachey68,2021-07-31,Relaxing stay We only stayed for 2 nights but will definitely be back. Hotel was bright and well decorated. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient. Our fridge wasn't working on our first day but reception stored our bits in their downstairs fridge and brought up to our room in the morning. Fridge was fixed the next day. Some restaurant menus in the room would be a good idea as we didn't realise until too late that you did afternoon tea 😧  All in all though 10/10.
345,padsmcginty62,2021-06-30,"Very enjoyable stay We have stayed here before pre pandemic and also when restrictions were relaxed last July. We enjoyed this stay as although there are some restrictions it was nearly like a normal stay. Breakfast was great, virtually the same choice as before and we we very impressed especially as we had a very poor breakfast offering at another well known hotel chain a couple of weeks earlier. There was an issue with the key card not working on at least 3 occasions and it was lucky we were on the first floor as it could have been a lot more inconvenient than it was if we were on a higher floor. The staff were friendly and helpful and we would definitely stay again if we go back to Bristol."
346,ThisIsJules75,2021-07-31,"Clean, comfortable, quiet with great staff No complaints about the room.  Just what you expect from a Hilton hotel in this price range.  The room was bright and spacious, clean, comfortable and we got a good nights sleep.  The location of the hotel was ideal as well.  Only a few mins from the train station and short walk from the middle of town.

All the staff were super friendly and helpful.  Extra thanks to the gentleman at reception who helped direct my wife to a shop to find a hairbrush, and the lady serving breakfast who was a breath of fresh air and positivity.  Excellent service by all the hotel staff.  Would stay again."
347,anniebee50,2021-07-31,"Fabulous This is the best hotel we have stayed in at Bristol. The Customer Service Manager, Peter, made our 5 night stay very comfortable and welcoming. He is a credit to the hotel. We received a free room upgrade and complimentary drinks. The cleanliness and service is first class. The rooms are spotlessly clean. Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in a central location."
348,Roving618267,2021-07-31,"Not bad, but not what I expected from a Hilton This hotel is fine, but nothing special. I’ve come to expect a slightly luxurious standard from Hilton Hotels, but this one is a little cramped and tired. The room felt very small, and the furnishings were basic. Some signs of wear and tear. 
The staff were all very polite and helpful, and the breakfast was good and fresh. 
Nothing awful here, but for the price you can find much more comfortable accommodation in Bristol."
349,1152man,2021-06-30,"Bristol the best From the moment we checked in for our overnight stay, things could not have been better. Lovely room with I have to say the best shower I've ever had. I didn't want to get out. We were on a coach trip so evening meal was provided. Again this was a  first class three course meal.

A very pleasant bar area and I liked the fact a local beer brew was available on draft.

Breakfast the following morning was again excellent with so much on offer.

Well done to everyone."
350,Chariotchoogle,2021-06-30,"Great Weekend Break This was our third visit to the Hilton, the first since easement of lockdown restrictions, have to say its better than ever.  Rooms are still super comfortable, staff  continue to be super friendly, courteous and professional. Two things that have changed since my last visit is that its nice to see life again, people of all ages having fun whilst recognizing covid regulations.  Breakfast is a real treat, almost back to normality, everything you need, gone are the Croissants in a bag, and it proved that customers' can take and be in charge of themselves to be covid respectful, well done Hilton for making that work.  If I had to call out a particular member of staff it would be the ""hello my lovely"" breakfast chef, she surely brightened most peoples days up.  Also the poor barman on the Saturday night, even though he was so over worked with preparing non stop cocktails for several parties he remained cheerful, but this is where I think the on duty managers' should have got involved, in the words of Alex Polizzi role your sleeves up and poor some ******* drinks.
All n all, another great weekend in Bristol, comfortable room, great breakfast, lovely staff and a sign of life getting back to normal.  Thank you Hilton for a lovely weekend."
351,janiceandbryn,2021-06-30,"Excellent hotel This was our second stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Bristol and it did not disappoint. The room was spotlessly clean, the staff were brilliant and breakfast was perfect - special mention for the extremely competent breakfast chef.
The hotel is five minutes walk from the railway station and fifteen from the centre of Bristol.
We will be back!"
352,V1737IAgailb,2021-06-30,"Lovely hotel This is our favourite hotel when we visit Bristol, Peter, Annie, Elena and vinroy? Who work on reception are so friendly and welcoming, we had a problem with our window which wouldn't shut properly and they offered to move us to a different room, as we're going tomorrow we decided not to move but it was a lovely idea, the hot breakfast is really good, served by a very friendly chef. Thank you so much for making our stay such a good one."
353,natashagW8253PE,2021-06-30,"Absolutely AMAZING!!! This is my second time writing this review as I don’t believe the first one was submitted correctly! I needed to express how amazing two members of staff were, although they were all great! These two were amazing. Paulo and Lorenzo (forgive my spelling) really made my stay special! They were both very attentive with a personal touch! Hotel was beautiful too but due to the service I received id jump at the opportunity to go back! Thank you so much"
354,GrantGLondon,2021-06-30,"Tiny room but very good hotel We stayed here for 5 nights, and it was everything it claimed to be. The room itself was ridiculously small, and as a result I left a couple of things behind. It was only possible for one person at a time to move around the room, so I never checked the window side when we left. Because of that, I left two items behind but the hotel sent them to me very quickly and efficiently, so full marks for that. They also went to some lengths to try and get us an air-conditioned room. We arrived on the first warm day of the year and the room was sweltering. In the end they got the air-conditioning going and we had no further problem. The rooms have fridges for the use of the people staying in them, which is very rare in the UK, where refrigeration is regarded with suspicion. For me, that automatically makes this the best hotel in Bristol. The breakfast was very good. The restaurant was adequate, if somewhat chaotic. The shower was good. The wifi was excellent after a few teething problems. I'd definitely recommend this hotel, and would be happy to stay there again."
355,PhyllisR851,2021-06-30,The staff make it Have just returned from a two night stay with my sister it had been a birthday gift to me having had two lockdown birthdays! Well Bristol proved to be a exellent choice and the hotel too but it was most definatley the staff that made it.Every  member gave there full commitment to making our stay the very best. Give yourselves a pat on the back.
356,O1742YJlindseyr,2021-06-30,"Great bar and restaurant We stayed here for a night on our way home from Wales. We booked a 'great escape' deal with dinner and breakfast and a variety of extras like a cocktail, antipasta and wine and a really late check out of 4pm.
The hotel is spotlessly clean. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The room was small, nothing fancy but comfortable. Tea and coffee and toiletries in the room.
We had a problem with the noise of the air conditioning, it was like an aeroplane taking off when on full. It was needed on full as it was pushing 30 degrees. I asked for it to be checked and it was immediately, no messing about. The staff also checked if we could move rooms and while they did this they gave us a complimentary drink so we could wait in comfort. This was a lovely touch.
The bar is a nice environment. We sat outside to have our meal which was very tasty. Bradley served us and right from the start he made us feel at home. He made us lovely drinks and was so cheery we felt very happy. I think he deserves a special thank you for making our evening more enjoyable! Breakfast was good quality and lots of choice, nice to see fresh pastries which other hotels have stopped since covid, little things like that were nice to see. Check out was easy, nothing too much trouble for the staff here."
357,Miguel_Angel1810,2021-05-31,"Everything you need with wonderful customer service! Really well located hotel. Only 5 minutes walking to the train station and 10 minutes walking to the main attractions. 

We were welcome by a really nice receptionist (Eleanor, I think!) She was really helpful and informative.

The room has everything you need, nice views facing the Temple garden plus it was spotless.

We had dinner in the restaurant on Monday and the manager on duty was very attentive and chatty. Food was also very good, however we were quite full but we were offered a box to take the rest with us without even asking for it - Nice gesture! 

Breakfast was really good, plenty of choices and the staff again, was really helpful and friendly ( especially, Louisa and the girl from Almería - Apologise, I don’t remember her name). 

Good hotel and amazing staff! Thank you!"
358,mnshollnd,2021-05-31,"Amazing Staff & Location Just stayed for 2 nights over the Bank Holiday. I can honestly say the staff in the hotel are fantastic, every one of them, credit to you Hilton. Special mention to Brad and Paulo. Breakfast was excellent and everything was COVID safe in all areas. We particularly enjoyed the sun terrace with such cool relaxing music. We spent a day in Bath and the hotel is just across the road from the strain station and the journey is around 10 minutes and just one stop. Well worth a visit.
All in all, we loved the hotel and Bristol, and will be returning very soon."
359,missdlopezq,2021-05-31,"Terrible I was in room 310 and the noise when opening the tab was unbearable. The people near me in the room next would use the bathroom and it would People for minutes. ALMOST THOUGHT I DAMAGED MY EARS.

I was waiting at the lift and suddenly the roller goes down and the fireplace goes off. Bear in mind the door was closed. Finally after a few minutes it opens...the receptionist saw me and no one even tells me why the alarm went off. I HAD TO GO up to them and they said it was a ""test"". What about you coming up to me.  I am the one panicking.

The food is plain and no taste"
360,444MaryH,2021-05-31,"Super staff Had an afternoon tea (gift0 soon after we could eat indoors again. So impressed with the managing of the trip. Was safe, but not oppressive. We were served by 3 staff, (welcomed with drinks, then food, then clearing) who were each very kind, very polite and friendly. The food was great too, but I realised its the service we have missed during lock down. Grateful thanks"
361,NIbeachu,2021-05-31,"N Ibeachu Will be visiting then again and possibly with my better half lol the staff were all welcoming both desk and kitchen staff, the meal was tasty and yummy. Will miss the breakfast even more, good team and keep it up 👍"

The big issue is actually managing to get to it as sat navy I  Bristol have been rendered useless by the constant building and closed or diverted roads. Reception told me you are best to try and use Google if you can."

The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great, I ate so much and the poached eggs were perfect. Only downside is Temple Way is very busy and I was in a room (533) facing the main road and car park so there was a bit of noise."

366,A380fan,2021-05-31,"Comfy rooms The room was very nice, if not a little small.

Was invited a few times after booking to upgrade to a high floor (for £5). I declined.  At online check in I selected a top floor room.  A few hours later I got a call to say that the top floors are closed, and that I'd been moved to the same room on the 2nd floor.  Then on arrival I got assigned a different room.  The upgrade was clearly a scam, and online check in totally pointless."

The setting was great with a superb large outside terrace area with canopy, and even patio heaters and blankets if the temperature dips. The menu was spot on and the food and service was five star! Will definitely be visiting again if in the area."
370,337michaelm,2021-03-31,"Working away  Following a unhappy stay at another local Hilton, I decided to try this lovely garden inn.

My initial welcome was excellent despite myself being tired and made to being felt very welcome.

Upon checking in my room I noticed the air conditioning was not working but quickly moved to a new room. 

I had evening food which was ok, just feels awkward walking to your room and then you lose the freshness but in general a good effort considering the epidemic we are going through.

As with breakfast was slightly annoyed as I requested a change of time the evening prior on my second day but this was obviously missed out so had to very quickly get Ready. All in all the breakfast was absolutely delicious, I do look forward to eating in the restaurant moving forwards.

The beds are very comfy with a large tv and good working space on the large desk.

All the staff at the hotel are a great credit with their smiles and their politeness. Thank you and look forward to seeing you soon."

Tea & coffee makinc facilities in the room which I always appreciate, and a small fridge as well. Staff were all friendly and helpful: reception, housekeeping, restaurant. Excellent advice on wine. Scrumptious breakfast. Great care taken with precautions against Covid 19 throughout the hotel.  A taste of luxury in difficult times."

The hotel is clean and decent but cannot give it more than 2 stars as no connection to internet, colleagues had same issue. Modern hotels should not have these issues.
Disappointing to have score so low, grub was ok in restaurant decent but not special I would say.

Sort out your connection!"
374,Kkwally,2020-10-31,"Not bad but probs wouldn’t come back Arrived in Bristol with my partner for the weekend. We were checked in quickly by a very friendly man and went to our room, it was very clean but smaller than a premier inn room that we had stayed ina few days before. 

We went out for a few drinks in Bristol then came back for a couple in the hotel bar, the bar manager and staff were really accommodating and friendly and really made us feel welcome. On the first night we realised the bed wasn’t particularly comfy and pillows are feather (I believe) which means they deflate into nothing when you lay on them which led to a bad nights sleep. 

On the second night I got some more pillows in the hope it would be comfort but alas they were still hopeless and after a night of tossing and turning I called reception in the middle of the night to get an extra pillow. Now I’m not sure what the receptionist thought I was doing with these extra pillows but he was very cagey and a little rude about giving me another one. 

Overall the service was generally very good but room was not comfortable which let it down"

Was not value for money. 

3 sandwiches - ham salad, cheese and pickle and egg.... very cheap fillings .... where’s the salmon and beef?!  tasted like they had been made in the morning and left as edges were crusty

Small slice of fruitcake, cherry Bakewell and a defrosted Elaine. 

2 scones with Jam an cream .... we used all the cream on 2 of scones and asked the waitress for more cream - she went in kitchen and came back saying no more cream as the chef has left for the day .... I didn’t realise you had to be a professional chef to put cream in a container 😱.... 

We have had lots of afternoons teas and this was by far the worst one we have had for the money we paid. We won’t be returning and would advise you to book somewhere else."
377,AlanKLeeds,2020-09-30,"Poor - will not stay again I don't like to post a poor review. Any hotel can have one problem, but there were too many at this hotel.

We've stayed here a number of times over the years, and I this will be the last. 

The rooms haven't changed much - a bit on the small side but reasonably well equipped. 

It's the approach to Covid-19 that lets it down. We booked in for 3 nights, only to find that there would be no room service. This would be OK, but toiletries, coffee, cups, etc were only provided for a one night stay, meaning we had to call (or visit due to no reply) reception for more.  Not good.

Things got worse for the evening meal. A poorly photocopied menu offering burgers and pizzas should have set alarm bells ringing. As should an empty restaurant at 7:00pm. The pizza was mediocre - dry chicken, dry sauce and too much chilli on a doughy base. Other hotels seem to be able to maintain standards, so why not Hilton? The server also wore a face mask that didn't cover his nose. Not good.

Overall, the hotel seemed short staffed and doing the minimum to get by. Back when this was a Mint hotel, and then a City Inn, you were guaranteed quality food (and an iMac in the room). I appreciate there are Covid-19 guidelines, but this is no excuse for such a fall in standards. Not something one expects from any of the Hilton chain. We stayed in two other hotels during September; they managed to deliver great service and food, including room service, whilst maintaining good Covid-19 procedures.

Finally, checking out was probably the worst I've had. First we had a breakfast charged to the room, which we didn't have. The gent at check-out corrected it. But when I looked at the bill, a £5.55 had appeared. I went back and the gent explained (almost condescendingly) that the removal of the breakfast charge resulted in the balance being less than the guarantee amount that the hotel charged to the card on checking in, resulting in a £5.55 credit being added back. Fine, but all entries were shown as debits and all were coded with no clue as to what the codes were. Sorry, but I expect a bill or invoice to be clear and understandable. Not good, Hilton."
378,Stenvoid,2020-09-30,"Clean and efficient - very difficult to find by car This is a centrally located hotel, it's good on check-in, with clean rooms, efficient staff, covid-friendly throughout and an excellent breakfast offering (so efficient in fact they cleared my coffee away before I'd even taken a sip!).

However, what - for me - let the place down, was trying to find it. Not necessarily the hotel's fault but details on the website were scant and the combination of recent road-layout changes, closed off roads, roadworks and traffic volume in Bristol meant it took me more than 45 minutes to find it, driving round in circles."
379,lbtravelsalot,2020-09-30,Clean comfortable hotel I have stayed here a few times this summer and have always found the staff at this hotel really welcoming and helpful. The beds are really comfy and I love the pillows. Look forward to visiting again in the future.
380,suzej5,2020-09-30,"Good location We had a double room over looking the temple gardens. Room was very clean. Reception explained that they were limiting the stuff they put out as it has to be removed after each guest stay. So no mini bar or excessive toiletries. This was fine as we bring our own and reception just said ask if you need it.
Time slot needs to be booked for breakfast to enable corona spacing. Good choice of breakfast, cooked items served to you by staff. All straight forward.
Good shower, I found the bed a little too firm but each to their own. Air con good but a little noisy.
Quick 10 min walk to old city and attractions and not far from Temple Meads Station. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Would recommend it"
381,Cardiardaith,2020-08-31,"Handy for train station but no left luggage facility Few mins walk from Temple Meads station along a new path through new business district which is pedestrianised. (Go straight ahead after the ticket barriers and don't exit into station drop off area).  Very modern and clean decor to the hotel but nothing memorable.  Breakfast served in their restaurant which is a plus.  Nice walk through old churchyard opposite will get you to convenience stores, couple of nice pubs and a family Italian restaurant (currently closed).  Five minutes further and you are in the old heart of Bristol-Corn Street, atmospheric Market, Quay restaurants and bars etc.  Good soundproofing in room and aircon means it won't get too hot as windows don;t open very far.  Shower only, no bath.  
Main gripe is that there is no left luggage at the moment due to Covid restrictions....Having arrived by train at 9am I was faced with wheeling my case around Bristol until 3pm check-in!! I would have gone home but fortunately, the duty manager yielded and let me leave my case in an empty office.  Lacking an area to leave luggage is a real nuisance for people using public transport and needs to be addressed by Hilton if they want to welcome tourists back and have properties near train stations where a number of people won't have a car or have no access to left luggage facilities (none at station)."
382,Splodge_8,2020-08-31,Good Hotel which is let down by parking facilities Hotel room was slightly hot.  Only a small slot in windows can be opened for natural ventilation.  Breakfast very good.  One way COVID entrance/exit system for reception needs better signage.  Our room was generally clean and rooms are quiet.  Car Park is small and expensive.   Two successive nights the car park was full and cars were parked all along the unofficial sides of the car park so don't expect a guaranteed space if you are staying.
383,PrincessBosley22,2020-08-31,"Good Location. We stayed at this hotel for one night. We were checked in by Peter who is absolutely lovely and very knowledgeable regarding getting around Bristol and the locations of the sights and attractions.

The room was a little on the small side and felt quite stuffy, even with the window open. The bed was comfortable and the room was functional as a base for which to explore Bristol from. 

The car park is small and priced quite steep as the hotel is rated 4*.

The hotel was clean and all the staff were friendly and helpful. 

The hotel is well placed for Bristol Bridge and all the restaurants and bars along the river."

386,jozef_m605,2020-08-31,"Jozef wasn't too impressed by the room standards . Usually stay in Hilton hotels but this one wasn't really anything to get excited about . Air con is old fashioned so would be a nice wait before your room cooled down . Not helped by the fact the window has a tiny little bit you can open that hardly let's any breeze in . The bed was solid , was looking forward to a relaxing bath but that was scuppered when I went to my room to discover there is no bathtub. The fridge was not working had a bottle of water in it for 2 days and I don't even think it dropped a degree . Also the car park is tiny and I think the charge for the parking is a tad astronomical considering the price your charging for a sub standard 4 star Hotel room .
For a 4 star Hotel and the price you pay you would expect a bit more . 
However the staff and service I recieved was good so kudos to them . Probably wouldn't stay here again to be honest , which is sad really ."

The hotel itself is a a great position just 5 minutes walk from the old city and quayside. All hotel staff were polite, friendly and wearing masks as were most of the guest. The rooms are spacious for a night and in good order with aircon and heater easy to use. Rooms are sealed after cleaning to give trust that you are entering a ""sterile"" zone.

Checkin was quick and easy and then we had lovely burger and fries.  When we went up to the room, it was sealed and spotlessly clean.

389,pxc75,2020-08-31,"Highly stressful stay. At a difficulty time.  
The hotel location and amenities are acceptable for the price. 

However I experienced a problem with a colleague coming to my room in the late evening. 

This was aggressively handled (initially), and the policy of the hotel not clear on the issue. 

My colleague was told in no uncertain terms he was a risk of Covid19. Which is odd since I had no health screening on check in . 

DO NOTuse this hotel if you plan late work  meetings or if a colleague needs to collect an item.  

I felt that I was judged by the staff member in question. We resolved this, although the policy still not clear. 

Was made to feel I had done something wrong. Not a nice feeling but will be my only memory of this stay."

400,LondonNifty,2020-02-29,"Mixed bag I’m a big fan of the Hilton brand. However, this was one stay where I was slightly disappointed. Service as usual was faultless, quiet room on the fourth floor smallish with the king sized bed but perfectly adequate. Nonetheless, the Scotch egg ordered from room service was partly raw and £5.00 extra to deliver it to the room when getting downstairs was complicated let the overall stay down."
401,kulwinderr2015,2020-02-29,"Doesn’t uphold Hilton standards... I have been a regular visitor to this particular hotel for many years, well before Hilton took it over, back when it was known as the Mint Hotel. 

At that time it struck me as a fantastic example of an independent smart, contemporary hotel with exemplary standards of service. When Hilton took it over several years ago, I feared the worst. With, it transpires, justification.

Standards at this hotel have since gradually slipped to the point where I am now considering whether to ever visit it again (and I am a Hilton Honors member!).

Parking is now chargeable, at £16 a day. It used to be free for guests when this was the Mint. But there’s worse, much worse. 

I stayed in room 506 and, having returned to the room after dinner out in Bristol, I discovered that the air con/heating system in the room was completely kaput. 

To his credit, one of the staff - David - was quick to attend when I reported it at the front desk. But his solution was not to offer a change of room but to simply wheel a battered small oil radiator into the room. That really isn’t what I was expecting.

In any case, the heater was incapable of heating the room - it was way too small - so I spent a very long night in a very cold room, not at all my idea of a pleasant hotel stay. I’m just pleased that I hadn’t brought my wife on this trip, she would never have let me hear the end of it!

The speed with which the heater was wheeled in to the room suggests this was a very well known issue… why is the room being let out to guests while the heating system is known to be faulty?

Breakfasts here, too, are now an unmitigated disaster. It’s not the fault of the staff, they try their hardest. It’s just that there simply aren’t enough of them to adequately service the number of guests in the hotel. 

Foodstuffs took an absolute age to replenish - after 10 minutes I gave up waiting for the beans container to be refilled and had my full English (utterly bland, bacon as tough as well worn leather) without them. 

The pastry trays, too, were empty when I arrived - and stayed empty until I was about to leave, about 45 minutes later. Staff were often nowhere to be seen at the counter: guests took to reaching over flipping eggs that staff had started cooking!

People were hovering around the food trays for absolutely eons, hoping against hope that trays would be refilled: they waited in vain. The couple next to me had asked for waffles but gave up after 20 minutes. 

Then the two coffee machines gave up - there’s only self-service here now (when it was the Mint there was waiter service). I had to resort to asking the bar staff to get me one. However, I was third in line and by the time I got one and returned to my table the waitress had assumed I had left the restaurant and had cleared my table!

When checking out I was asked if I had enjoyed my stay. The receptionist seemed baffled when I said I had not, down mainly to the lack of heating. “But you got an oil heater, right?”, she queried. “Yes, but it was completely useless, I still froze,” I pointed out. “Oh well, I’m sorry about that,” she said before jovially printing out the bill. And that was that. 

The sad truth is that Hilton has failed to maintain the standards of the previous management at this hotel. Yes, it’s clean and the beds are comfy but there are other basics that guests need to be able to rely on. 

Like effective heating on a cold February night. Like a restaurant with enough staff in it. So I think that this, sadly, is the last year that I’ll be giving the Hilton Garden Inn Bristol my patronage. The Hilton group need to MUCH better than this…"
402,laurensh223,2020-02-29,"Friendly Staff and Lovely Bed! The moment I got to the reception area I knew this was a good hotel. The staff were welcoming and efficient, telling me places to check out whilst I was staying. You can even help yourself to a nibble, like a flapjack!

The quality of the room was super, it was spacious and the bed was dreamy. It was very clean overall. Bathroom seemed a tad small, but it'll do for one person at a time. The shower was a perfect size and easy to get into.

Breakfast was delicious, a classy buffet style and the staff were friendly and helpful throughout. I really enjoyed speaking to the staff, especially the bar staff who recognised my tired yawn and made me laugh.

Next time I come to Bristol I'll return here, especially for the location and bus links!"
403,ellicesophia,2020-02-29,"My favourite hotel in Bristol! I stay in Bristol frequently with work and have tried a number of hotels however The Garden Inn is by far my favourite. The rooms are clean and spacious with a nice view if you are on the park-facing side. 

Breakfast is of a great quality and the location is central enough to be within walking distance to temple meads and the city centre. 

However, the thing that distinguishes this hotel from the others is the customer service. The staff on reception, the restaurant staff and the cleaners are all so welcoming and can’t do enough for you. The customer service I’ve had while staying here every week for the past few weeks has been the best customer service I have ever received. The staff at breakfast even remember my daily breakfast order and bring it without me asking! Amazing customer service and so I will continue to choose the Garden Inn over other hotels in Bristol."

Being woken up at 6am by what I am assuming is domestic staff in the cupboard next to our room making stupid amounts of noise, to the noise of people on the stairs present constantly. The room was clean, however it was odd that there was no big light, just bedside table lights. The shower was good temperature just very low pressure, it was more like being outside on a windy but drizzly day, water lightly touching you. The bed was also noisy as anything, the slightest of movements being met with the most noise imaginable."
409,ErinTravel3,2020-01-31,"Broken heating; old rooms; stains on walls The hotel itself was freezing upon entering (my stay was in January). I was given a room that had cold air blowing from the vents. The hotel's heating engineer tried to fix it, which didn't work. I was moved to another room with heating that kept switching off and would not turn back on without manually pressing the button - not really possible at night. I asked for a space heater, but they were all loaned out to other guests. It's particularly annoying because I had just arrived from a 3-hour train delay and had an important interview the next morning. All I needed was time to prepare and a good night's sleep, but instead I had to spend time sorting a heating engineer for Room #1 then moving to Room #2 then freezing all night - I had to wear my winter coat and it was still freezing. Additionally, the rooms are old and there were large stains on the walls. I've had far better stays at budget hotels and would expect more from a city centre Hilton brand - I paid £120 ($160) for one night. The staff are nice and the reception and engineer tried to fix the problem; unfortunately, it didn't work, and this will be my first and last stay. Heating should be guaranteed for England in January!"

If she doesn’t I can see this turning into a local 😀

Oh dear I’ve just been told she didn’t pass 

We will see you all again soon team Hilton"
412,topbox,2020-01-31,"Christmas present  I am writing this review sitting in the lounge of the hotel,it’s a very nice hotel with really lovely staff,so friendly.Nothing is too much trouble.Room is comfortable and nice pillows. Bathroom is a bit small but has a great shower so no complaints there.We ate in the restaurant the first night,I wanted a steak and I wasn’t disappointed it was delicious with all the trimmings.My friend had a burrito she loved it.Because we went to Bath today 12 minutes on the train we decided to eat in the hotel again ,tonight we had fish and chips which was lovely definitely recommend the Recess restaurant.There is a Polish lady in charge and she is brilliant,always smiling and extremely helpful.She greeted us like we were best friends.Breakfast is very good with everything you want. Especially the lovely coffee machine it gives a good strong cup.I would recommend this hotel and if I’m ever in Bristol I will stay here again."
413,Jannerbloke,2020-01-31,"Any port in a storm. Here for one night for work. Coincided with January storm Brendan. Room up to usual standard and booking in and out efficient but, probably because of the lashing rain and powerful winds, both the dining room and bar were packed, presumably because almost everybody couldn’t face going outside into the tempest. No gripes except getting home the following evening to find that I had been belatedly sent an email doubling as a by now obsolete half price voucher for the meal I had eaten at the hotel on the evening of my stay."
414,Row_2k,2020-01-31,"such a lovely stay fantastic stay, very welcoming, and friendly staff! breakfast was really good! it was such a variety and hotel room was lovely, clean, free safe lock, they do everything they could to make it s lovely stay and it was, definitely would recommend and close to the shopping centre"
415,Sabriconga,2020-01-31,"Comfortable hotel near station Stayed here for one night and was impressed by the clean room, comfortable king sized bed and nice sized flat tv. Breakfast on site was nice, with plenty of choices. The staff was polite and efficient.
Will come back!"
417,Butsy19,2020-01-31,"Great Stay Chose this hotel due to its location, 5 minutes from train station, in one direction and 10 mins in other direction to shopping areas, bars and restaurants. 
Checked in on-line, and reserved a room of my choice, which made the actual check-in quick, easy and faultless. 
Acknowledged as a HH Gold Member and offer my benefits, either bonus points or free breakfast, we opted for breakfast. 
Room wasn't as big as other Hilton's we have stayed in, however for a short 3 night stay, it was fine, it had all the amenities you expect from Hilton, fridge, safe, tea/coffee, iron etc. 
Bathroom was quite compact, however again everything you needed. 
Breakfast is a buffet style, and it was superb, you are shown to a table and after that you just help yourself to anything/everything you want. 
Fried and Poached Eggs cooked fresh for you, and there is even the option for an omelette, along with all the usual, fruit juice, water, fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereal, ham, cheese, mackerel, and of course everything you need for a full English. 
Lovely little bar too for a drink after a long day's walk/shopping/sightseeing. 
The best thing about this hotel are the staff, they are all very friendly, and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. 
All in all we had a wonderful stay, and thanks again to all the staff, whether reception, duty managers, restaurant, bar and not to mention the people who looked after our rooms as everything was immaculate and clean. 
Would definitely stay here again."
2833,Y9911BDchloeg,2024-03-31,"1st trip to England with family The hotel was great and we had a great time. A special thank you to Arc Chakir and Navi for their kindness and professionalism.
The hotel is very comfortable and the breakfast is very generous.
This is an address that we will remember."
2834,valvanuzm2024,2024-02-29,Disappointing. Disappointing. Not a single USB plug in the entire hotel. Something like this has never happened to me!!! Is incredible!!! Mineral water not included in the breakfast buffet that you pay with the room. Hot chocolate for a 4-year-old child was also not included. I will never return to this hotel nor recommend it. You pay for a service that they do not offer you and to make matters worse the man at the reception is rude and does not solve anything.
2835,341ludivinec,2023-08-31,"not crazy but good accommodation Hotel along a road, at first glance not very pleasant and yet!
The park view room is very conventional, as you would expect from a chain hotel but well appointed. Special mention to the socket supporting different formats.
We appreciated the calm of the view of the park but less noise coming from the other rooms and the corridor.
The TV is ok but only has one French channel
The bathroom is good with a large shower.
The restaurant is very good with a very pleasant waiter and lots of choice.
The gym is perfectly adequate"
0,Yann,2023-08-12,Enjoyable hub for traving in the region by train Clean and nice room. Amazing staff at the front desk. Perfect location near the train station.
1,Les,2024-04-30,Superb Good clean comfy room. Excellent breakfast.

4,James,2024-04-28,"The hotel was: conveniently located, gave a friendly welcome and everything was smooth. The lady who cleaned my room was excellent. She was polite, friendly and couldn't do enough to make sure I was happy with the room. You were all great."
5,Sophie,2024-04-28,"Fabulous staff, great location! Reception staff were fantastic, especially Peter, who pulled out all the stops as it was a special occasion. Lovely location too. Easy walking distance to the old city."
6,Deryn,2024-04-28,Good location and friendly and helpful staff It was fine a wide choice. Carpets were stained in my bedroom otherwise all good
7,Zoe,2024-04-27,"Quite comfy and central location. Beds were comfy, shower was great! Staff were friendly and helpful. Parking available and the fee covered 24hr’s Room service…. Only pizzas available in the evening and you had to go down to the foyer to collect them 🤣 they also took a good 30 mins or so to arrive. Unfortunately we also looked out over building work but could see the park from a certain angle"
8,Luca,2024-04-26,"Good Staff, position Rooms a little old and decadent"
9,Simone,2024-04-26,"lovely hotel in a great location Room was lovely and clean, breakfast was very nice with a lot of variety Staff very friendly and helpful The bathroom was on the small side"
10,Laura,2024-04-24,Good  Finding the entrance of the hotel by car was challenging (there were some road works nearby too). More signs on the road please to direct your customers.
11,Julia,2024-04-24,Close to all amenities. Great breakfast Everything except the mattress! The mattress was very hard
12,Nancy,2024-04-22,Superb Really clean quiet room with amenities such as a TV and high quality toiletries. The staff were really helpful. The location was fairly central and very easy to get to the train station. It was fairly expensive for one nights stay.
13,Lesley,2024-04-22,"Overall a pretty successful short stay. The location was excellent. The staff were helpful and friendly, especially Marta in the restaurant. The breakfast was disappointing - fried eggs had been sitting on hot plate for ages and were hard, the bacon was very fatty."
14,Pavel,2024-04-22,"Good for one night Room was nice with a comfortable bed, with a very nice office chair (Herman Miller Sayl) and big table for doing some work. Shower came with nice shower gel and shampoo. Good location for the purpose of my stay as I went to Motion night club which is in close proximity to the hotel. Breakfast was very disappointing, very limited."
15,Wendy,2024-04-21,Good Great central location Bathrooms are quite small but the shower was lovely
16,Diane,2024-04-19,"Pleasant, but did not enjoy breakfast. Limited; but comfortable public area to sit and have a coffee. Staff very helpful. Cooked breakfast offered a good choice, however this is the second time we have stayed in the hotel and each time the breakfast items were only just warm and the plates were cold. The result was all the items on the plate were cold by the time we got back to the table. I particularly don’t enjoy cold baked beans!"
17,Francis,2024-04-15,"it was a nice stay Room was ample ,quite, had a view of the park which was part of a historical church. the room could have been a bit bigger for the price ."
18,Sesan,2024-04-12,Superb The staff were brilliant! The breakfast was very good. The bed in the room was a bit small. The AC did not work very well.
19,Shane,2024-04-11,"Very good Great staff, warm welcome, personable. Nicely appointed room. Excellent breakfast selection. Close to train station. Would definitely stay again. Air con was unpredictable and bed was a little rickety."
20,Daniel,2024-04-07,Good The bed was comfy the shower nice Not being able to park and walking ages to another car park and having no funding from the hotel to compensate for the parking charges like other hotels do
21,Salomonh,2024-04-06,"Perfect for our stay Close to the railway station and not far from centre we enjoyed our stay very much. Nice Staff (eg Dilara and Navi), very good breakfast quality, a comfortable bed and a good shower was provided. Even though we were facing a busy street quality windows allowed us to sleep very well. Socket was only provided at one side of the bed and not on both but there were plenty other sockets all around the room."
22,Joyce,2024-04-05,Very good Very helpful and friendly staff
23,Ana,2024-04-03,"Enjoyed our stay The staff was very friendly and the breakfast options were very good! One of the elevators was not working, the heating was not working (we were asked if we wanted to change rooms or a portable heater) and the TV remote was also not working (although they provided new batteries)"
24,Ulrike,2024-04-03,"Very good Very helpful staff, very nice breakfast and ideal for the station and the Airport."
25,Fiona,2024-04-03,"Would return Check in was polite, bar area was clean however did have to wait quite a while for service however. Breakfast was good but no vegan options. No vegan options at breakfast"
26,Lorraine,2024-04-01,"Good choice for a brief visit Good location, handy for train station. Dinner and breakfast were only ok."
27,Sunil,2024-04-01,Great for Business travellers like me. Great location. Everything is within walking distance.
28,Robert,2024-03-27,"Overnight in Bristol. Good quality chain hotel in the centre of Bristol. We have stayed here before, and it does everything it says on the tin. Good breakfast, with plenty of variety. The car park is very easy to see, but exceedingly difficult to find!"
29,Charlotte,2024-03-25,"Nice hotel, comfortable and good value Breakfast was good value and reception staff very helpful Really hard to find on the satnav"
30,Laura,2024-03-25,Decent stay Nice room and breakfast. The road towards the hotel was closed and no instructions were displayed. We almost missed the event we travelled for trying to find the hotel.
31,Sam,2024-03-24,"Good value, clean hotel with delicious breakfast Great breakfasts, very helpful staff Hard beds"
32,Diana,2024-03-21,"Would stay again The Hotel is easy walking distance from Bristol Temple Meads station. The reception staff was very welcoming and helpful. We were given a map and had an explanation how the get to our venue for the evening without really having to ask for it. The walk into the old town part was short. The room was clean and well arranged. The breakfast was good. The room was very warm and we did not seem to be able to get the A/C to cool it down. Maybe it was just us... but I mentioned it as we checked out and felt that my comment was being taken serious. A couple of things ran out during breakfast, and we were by no means late, and weren't replenished whilst we ate. We still manged to fill out tummies no problem though."
33,Seeseetv,2024-03-21,"Perfect for business overnight stay Great central location, onsite parking though chargeable More info on available car charging points would have been useful, didn't work on arrival but reception did manage to resolves so we could charge the car"
34,Tracey,2024-03-21,Great would stay there again Distance from city and staff were fantastic
35,Dan,2024-03-18,Very good Great location. Nice breakfast. Slightly small room but not disastrous.
36,Ashleigh,2024-03-16,Not great  Room right next to the lift and noise from the lift kept us awake all night . Requested a late check out of 12 agreed. Then hammering on the door constantly from 11 am would like twice about staying here again.
37,Debra,2024-03-13,"Superb The staff were sp friendly, yhe food in the restaurant was lovely😍. The sausages at breakfast were very anaemic"
38,Francesca,2024-03-11,"Good Good location, comfortable bed, didn’t mind me checking in at 11pm. My room had a nice view over a park which at night had the trees adorned with lights. The bathroom although clean was so tiny and very dated."
39,Lukrecia,2024-03-10,"Perfect location for town and the train station We stayed at the hotel overnight prior to catching a flight. The hotel is perfectly located - a few minutes walk from the train station and a short stroll from town. The staff on reception and in the restaurant were very attentive, polite and professional. We enjoyed our stay."
40,David,2024-03-07,"High quality central hotel offering excellent value for money The receptionist lady (sounded Dutch) was very wlecoming and moved us to a room overlooking the garden at the back. We only stayed one night as I was going to a concert at the Bristol Beacon and my wife was meeting old friends who live bear Bristol. The central location is perfect for the entertainment areas of the City and the local bars restaurants etc offer a range of cuisine and atmosphere. Breakfast options were good though both coffee machines were broken - a kind staff lady made us both coffees from a machine behind the bar Will definitely stay there again. The power on the shower was rather too weak to wash my wife's very thick hair. This was at least partially the result of the head leaking. Some of the wall tiles were cracked (Room 106) as was the shower basin, both probably the result of movement at some point. I reported all this on departure."
41,Amanda,2024-03-07,"Very good Breakfast was fabulous, staff were very helpful and pleasant"
42,Kayleigh,2024-03-06,As above Everything was fab. Food to the room (from the bar/restaurant) was delicious and all staff were very friendly
43,Nicola,2024-03-04,Superb The location
44,Rachel,2024-03-04,"Good room was good enough, suitable for my stay, location and breakfast was great the parking cost was only obvious after I had reserved the room, it was fine but a bit more transparency would be appreciated"
45,Robert,2024-03-04,"Good hotel Great location, friendly staff, very comfortable beds, decent breakfast Parking at £20 a night is somewhat steep"
46,Lee,2024-03-04,A perfect weekend The breakfast was superb and the night life in the location was amazing very culturall Nothing
47,Williams,2024-03-04,"Will definitely be back Comfy beds, good showers, lovely toiletries, great location, helpful staff. Slightly short on staff at breakfast and gloopy porridge (but rest of breakfast good)"
48,Kayleigh,2024-03-03,"Cleaned and suitable for an overnight stay in the city Easy and friendly check in. Clean and tidy room The bed was very squeaky, everytime you moved over in bed it made a noise which didn’t make for the best nights sleep"
49,Martina,2024-03-02,"Very good Staff friendliness, location, great breakfast Bathroom very small, rooms smaller than look on website"
50,Diane,2024-02-29,Good  Having to wait for breakfast while the coach trip were occupieing the whole restaurant
51,Andy,2024-02-28,"Comfy hotel near to Bristol station Bed was comfy and lots of storage space. The breakfast was good and had lots of options. Staff were friendly and let me store my bicycle in the store room over night which was a big plus. check in and check out were quick and easy. Only thing I didn't like was the design of the floor tiles in the bathroom for safety reasons, they're white with a design that looks like splashes of water. So it looks like there's water on the floor but isn't, but when there IS water on the floor, you can't see it"
52,Jenny,2024-02-26,"Adequate with reservations The room was fine, if a little cramped for two people. There were sufficient towels and soaps, etc. Although facing the busy road, the room was quiet. The reception staff were very pleasant, if rather slow in checking in & out. The hotel charge was adequate for the services we received. Bottled water was provided. There were no USB ports in the room, surprising for an obvious business hotel. There was a fridge but it had been turned off. There were limited channels on the TV. We were encouraged to have lunch in the restaurant but when we arrived just before 12:00 we were asked to sit in a corner as they were still clearing away after breakfast. Whilst eating the cleaner progressed with a noisy vacuum cleaner across the breakfast area and then arrived at the corner we were seated at. She proceeded to vacuum around our table and even under our feet whilst we ate! We booked the hotel because the car park had EV points. I know they could not guarantee one would be available but we found none of the 3 points usable and had to go to a local supermarket and sit for an hour to recharge. We did not have breakfast as the lunch we had the day before was most unappetising. Inferior ingredients and tasteless."
53,David,2024-02-25,fair hotel but too expensive Nice staff location cold room breakfast not great tv was poor
54,Andy,2024-02-25,Good Location Disorganised breakfast arrangement Broken arm rest on chair in the room. Light on the TV where it has probably been damaged
55,Mcgeough,2024-02-25,"CLEAN AND FUNCTIONAL - A GOOD BUSINESS HOTEL A comfortable business hotel, very clean. Breakfast - could offer vegetarian options, and dairy alternatives. I asked for the oat milk and the memebr of staff wehnt off and don't bother to return. Breakfast - could offer vegetarian options, and dairy alternatives. I asked for the oat milk and the member of staff went off and don't bother to return A little further from the centre of town than expected, travel time doubles during traffic."
56,Alan,2024-02-23,"Convenient location, comfortable room, easy to use facilities but a little overpriced (in my view) I booked this hotel for its location just 10 mins walk from my company's office and less than 30 mins walk to the harbourside area too. Everything was simple and straight forward, staff were friendly and efficient, room was clean and comfortable, breakfast was of a good standard and served from 6am - great for an early start. Small niggles - no small cups for espressos at breakfast. No soft or dimmable lighting in the room (or at least, I didint find it) Similar to many hotel chains, I feel it was a little over-priced."
57,Rachel,2024-02-22,"Great location, good value. Clean. Great location! Easy walk from temple meads and city centre."
58,Wendy,2024-02-21,Great stay. Good location near railway station not to far into Bristol town centre.Comfortable room very quiet even thou our room was on the road side. All the hotel colleagues were friendly and helpful especially Navi who was on duty in the morning for breakfast. Can’t really think of anything negative.
59,Peter,2024-02-18,Superb Excellent location to transport and restaurants.
60,Tim,2024-02-18,Very good Location close to city centre Tiny bathroom
61,James,2024-02-18,Perfect location from which to explore Bristol with most attractions a relatively short walk away Great location and very friendly staff
62,Brad,2024-02-17,"Great location and good staff Location, staff Broken light in room, room upgrade to king didn’t feel like much of an upgrade"
63,Louise,2024-02-16,"Perfect, out of town, within easy reach of town stay. The property is ideal for us, as we travel by train. 5 mins walk tops, and we’re at the hotel. It’s a bit further into town, but still very central. Some lovely areas to pass through and things to see on the way. It’s a quiet hotel and the staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was pleasant. Nothing"
64,Joseph,2024-02-14,"The day was good. The breakfast was good, the staff excellent. Paying an extra £20 for parking"
65,David,2024-02-14,Superb The bed and the breakfast were excellent No arm chairs in the bedroom
66,Freddie,2024-02-14,"We have stayed at the HGI in Bristol a few times. It’s close to the station, has parking, the rooms are OK, dinning room Good location, nice staff"
67,Roger,2024-02-14,"Good On site parking, albeit £20 per 24 hours. Great location. Quiet room. Breakfast was average for a 4 star hotel."
68,Samantha,2024-02-12,"Very good Shared facilities were lovely. The breakfast was very good, lots of variety. Great location for heading to the shopping centre or the theatre which is what we were there for. The reception staff were very welcoming and accommodating too. The room was a little tired in places and needed some updating. Wonky switches, toilet roll holder, paint chipped off the skirting. It could have done with better sound proofing too, we could hear the couple above us quite clearly!"
69,Andy,2024-02-11,"Ideal spot for a weekend visit. Great location, close to the train station and the city centre, but also quiet enough to have a relaxing stay. The team were incredibly helpful and friendly from start to finish, and the breakfast was good to wake up to Late night room service would have been helpful, but we were able to order in Uber Eats, so there was a suitable alternative. The front desk were very happy to suggest this."
70,David,2024-02-11,"Would stay again Good location, good staff, nice breakfast One of the towels provided wasn’t clean"

75,Sue,2024-02-04,"Good location, close enough to the centre. Staff were very helpful and pleasant. The locality to Bristol Temple Meads"
76,John,2024-02-03,"Would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel. The location is excellent. Within easy walking distance to restaurants and pubs and The Fleece where we had booked to see a show. Very good breakfast included in the price. Finding the place was a bit of a nightmare but, to be fair this was aggravated by all the construction work going on in the area. To my mind the car parking charge of £20 per 24 hours is a bit of a liberty. Although the breakfast was first-class the organisation was a bit chaotic."
77,Lizzie,2024-02-01,"Relaxing time with my sister Modern, spacious, clean Creaky beds! We did sleep well though so that’s good. Reception staff not massively friendly, could be a bit friendlier"

79,Ian,2024-02-01,"Great team at this spotless city centre hotel Bar / restaurant/ reception team were excellent. Hotel and room were spotless. Even on the lowest setting, I couldn't get the Aircon cool enough."

89,Michael,2024-01-18,Great location for us and great bar at the garden behind the hotel. Location to linking travel. Breakfast included. Young Staff in the dining room were super attentive and observant! Well done. Receptionist was also helpful at check in as my card locked out. Breakfast cooked to order would be fantastic.

94,Chrissss,2024-01-16,"A good deal The hotel was conveniently located and easy to find. The breakfast was gorgeous and the bed extremely comfy. Good wifi and very friendly staff. I was a bit disappointed with the room size, I was promised a King Room but it felt cramped, the mini fridge was also unstocked and broken."
95,Mykhailo,2024-01-15,"Very good Overall experience is good, however we had expected a little bit better. The hotel has not been renovated for a while and it doesn't feel like 4-stars accommodation. But the breakfast was excellent and the staff were very helpful."
96,Clare,2024-01-15,"Very good Warmth, comfort gluten free bread toilet roll holder could have been cleaned"

98,Terry,2024-01-13,I enjoy staying at the Hilton Garden. But feel it isn’t quite as good as it once was. Easy access to train station. Clean and tidy. The room was cold. And didn’t warm up all night. And breakfast needed to be hotter. The bacon was so cold I couldn’t cut it.

102,Rob,2024-01-08,"A great place to stay for central Bristol A nice, modern hotel. Rooms were comfortable. Location was great for central Bristol and Bristol Temple Meads station. Breakfast was great - really nicely cooked as opposed to other hotels I've stayed at."
103,Jessica,2024-01-03,"It was a nice stay in a good location It's in a good central location. The room was nice, the bathroom was a little small and kind of in a corner with no bath just a shower cubical in the wall but it was sufficient for my needs. Parking is very limited and was full when I arrived at 9pm, I tried calling the hotel for help on where to park but was given directions as if I was a local which I struggled to follow in the dark in my car so I ended up searching for the nearest NCP carpark which was about 10 min walk away in the rain with my bags which wasn't ideal after a long trip to get there."
104,Chris,2024-01-03,"Waffles,waffles,breakfast is king! Central, clean and friendly £20 to park overnight but to be fair it’s very close to the train station!"

106,Keith,2023-12-31,"Wonderful Stay ! Fantastic location , opposite Temple Park and Temple Church. Ten mins walk to shopping mall and Old city. Friendly helpful staff with a smile. Clean room. Breakfast was basic but fresh. We enjoyed our 2 night stay. Highly recommended. Dinner was awful. My salmon tasted sour and my partner roast was Bland and dry. Gravy like water with no colour and body to it. Dissapointed!"
107,Juliet,2023-12-31,"Clean and well appointed room, friendly staff. Friendly staff, very clean, well appointed room, easy to park. Despite being on a very busy main road, it was quiet in the rooms. Breakfast was reasonable but no butter on the first morning and staff (whilst very friendly) didn't keep on top of making sure there was cutlery on tables, plates available at some of the food stations etc. A minor grumble, but some attention to detail lacking. Location not the best, on a main road with a fair walk to city centre ( we are happy walking, but others might not be) Parking expensive - £20 per day."
108,Alastair,2023-12-30,A comfortable stay. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. Trying to find my way into the car park took a long time as not signposted that need to go round a load of back streets to get to it.
109,Mark,2023-12-30,"Superb Great breakfast, comfy bed. Bathroom was on the small side"
110,Rachel,2023-12-29,Excellent service and a great location The bed was so comfy and all the facilities were fine- the room was quite small and for a king room thought we would have a bath No bath
111,Ann,2023-12-24,A good city centre hotel. Room was clean and comfortable with a very good en suite. views over the city were good. Staff were very attentive and helpful with an excellent balance between friendliness and professionalism We struggled to find the parking at the hotel but this was probably due to the number of roadworks. Breakfast was a little disappointing as we felt that some of the food had been sitting in the hot buffet too long
112,Isabelle,2023-12-23,Ok Location Heating didn’t work. G Hotel provided heater and blanket Fan stayed on all night - noisy Restaurant staff were not very engaging - sit anywhere and no more info about where items were or how breakfast service worked.
113,Jonathan,2023-12-20,Very good Very good location That the central heat was not working
114,Ian,2023-12-18,Very good Room good How cold breakfast area was and no direction to what was on offer coffee for example was not same place as food.
115,Lesley,2023-12-18,Very good The room was very clean and comfortable People standing round the main door smoking. Breakfast was cold. And to far from the town if walking. As my sister had difficultys.
116,Leo,2023-12-18,"Superb staff and good location. All staff were pleasant. The lady on reception when we arrived was particularly helpful on several occasions. The hotel location was ideal for us, being a very short walk from the station and close to a music venue we had tickets for. Bars and eateries close by too. This was not exactly a big problem or dislike, but it would have been nice to have an electrical socket on both sides of the bed."
117,Gabriel,2023-12-17,"Clean, comfortable, value for money. Comfortable and clean. Easy to get to from the venue of the wedding we attended. Light in room didn't seem to work but had lamps so didn't bother us."
118,Bernadette,2023-12-16,"Good Great location, friendly staff Rooms a little grubby"
119,Joanne,2023-12-15,"Lovely Bar/restaurant is lovely, it’s open plan, the lovely big windows. The entrance is light and airy and smells lovely. All the staff were great and extremely helpful Would defo stay again."
120,Lauren,2023-12-15,A good place to stay with friendly & welcoming staff All staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast spread was good and food quality was perfect. Our room & bathroom were both clean but very small. Room and bathroom size were small
121,David,2023-12-14,Good  The bar & restaurant was closed both nights
122,Fatima,2023-12-13,"Excellent hotel for city breaks. Excellent location near city centre, places of interest and transports. The toilet is too small."
123,Megan,2023-12-10,"Easy The staff were really helpful. Comfy beds, lovely breakfast No issues"
124,Kate,2023-12-10,"Good Lovely helpful staff, generally good breakfast Rooms too hot even with AC. Porridge was absolutely vile"
125,Heather,2023-12-09,"Good Location is good 👍 Private function on so no restaurant or bar. They had a table to order drinks in reception but nowhere to sit. No discount for reduced service. Bed was not comfortable, no coffee in room or water."
126,Michael,2023-12-08,"Superb close to a venue for a concert parking was x10 the price of any parking locations nearby and there's a lot , you expect a mark up but x10 is robbery"
127,Melina,2023-12-06,"Very good The staff was friendly and I generally liked the room. The breakfast buffet offered the perfect start to the day! It was a bit cold in the room. I used the AC as recommended and put it on the hottest temperature, but it was still quite cold and didn't seem to work well (it was a freezing day outside as well)."
128,John,2023-12-05,Very good Location Breakfast . The bacon and sausage wasn't very nice
129,Christine,2023-12-04,Pleasant clean place with very nice staff in an excellent location Location is excellent Expensive … lunches very expensive
130,Lisa,2023-12-03,"Family visit Location, comfortable rooms, friendly staff Limited parking..."
131,Kenneth,2023-11-28,"Good but air con needs sorting out Very close to town, staff very good Our first room the air con did not work, our next room it worked but not very well"
132,Dey,2023-11-28,very enjoyable The hole time was good had a lovely evening with my Grand children and then attended his Graduation we thought the price of the meal and drinks were a bit high
133,Emma,2023-11-27,"Ok for short stay Handy location, short walk from the station and to the centre. Staff were friendly and helpful. Small room and bathroom, bed was a bit hard. Seemed more like a travel Inn than a Hilton hotel. Expensive considering size and basic nature of the room (even though it was a Queen room apparently). Breakfast area seemed a bit chaotic and rowdy."
134,Julie,2023-11-27,"Superb The staff were exceptional at this hotel, especially Peter on reception. Great location too!"
135,Hilary,2023-11-24,Superb View of the park I would like a coat hook near the room door.
136,Jean,2023-11-23,Four of us had a short but very enjoyable stay and would certainly return whenever we are in Bristol The room was a little small and the bathroom very small. However they included everything necessary and were very clean so nothing to complain about. The breakfast was excellent especially the offer of omelettes and poached eggs to order. A special mention must be made of Ash (Subash?). He went out of his way to ensure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Exceptional employee. Small size of bathroom but it did have a great magnified mirror. Not enough comfortable chairs in the bar area.
137,Richard,2023-11-22,I’d book again Location and value Prefer bath to showers
138,Paul,2023-11-21,"Overall very happy with our stay. Staff very helpful and friendly Breakfast choice/omelettes Clean Close to station /park Free overnight parking close by Bed size, previously stayed in room with bigger bed"
139,Andrew,2023-11-20,"Pleasant, fair price Clean, comfortable room. Staff changed our room when the temperature in the original one couldn't be reduced. Breakfast good. Very friendly and helpful staff. Not possible to reduce temperature in original room."
140,Jeannette,2023-11-20,"Comfortable hotel best suited for business travellers I stayed one night for business. The room was fine, clean and comfortable, with tea making facilities in the room. Great breakfast selection and very welcoming staff. Although perfectly comfortable, the room was very beige, with almost office-like furniture. Good for a business trip, but for a leisure visit I would expect more for the price. The location is not very inspiring, but near the station, which suited my needs."
141,Alan,2023-11-20,Good Location and staff
142,Penny,2023-11-19,"Comfortable, pleasant staff, good breakfast Near to the station, contemporary decor (lovely smell in the reception areas!), pleasant staff and great breakfast. Breakfast layout rather confusing and lots of items had run out"
143,Dawn,2023-11-19,Good The hotel is in a good location near the station and a short walk into the center of Bristol. The room was clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was very good. The staff were helpful and friendly.
144,Eddie-e,2023-11-19,Bristol bomboolash Good location near station. 10 mins walk into town. Easy check in. Nothing
145,Adele,2023-11-19,Great location for city break It was a good location close to old town and harbour with parking
146,Julie,2023-11-17,"Great location, Great breakfast The smell of the hotel was fabulous. there was an atomiser near the lift. smelt gorgeous. Staff were friendly and helpful Location was perfect. The waffle maker for breakfast was brilliant. nom The view from our window was probably the worst we've ever had. building work and scaffolding to building next door. was a shame, but unavoidable. didn't detract from room particularly as was just a place to rest our heads. The coffee machine wasn't working so couldn't easily get a cuppa, then another, as a member of staff had to work the only hot drink machine behind the bar"
147,Colin,2023-11-16,"Overall a positive experience, spoiled only by inattentive breakfast staff The check-in and check-out were very smooth and the gentlemen on reception was extremely helpful and efficient. Room was perfect for what I needed, very clean and comfortable, and the location of the hotel was perfect for my needs. Car parking was also very handy and worked well. Long wait to get a table for breakfast - not because of the lack of tables, but because there was nobody there to attend to the waiting guests. Empty tables were not being cleared and re-set, so when someone did finally take me to a table, I had to wait again while the table was cleared and re-set. The person doing that did not seem to recognise that a lot of people were waiting and did not seem to be in a hurry to get fresh tables ready. For a hotel of this category, I would have expected a lot more."
148,H,2023-11-13,Long weekend in Bristol. It was a short walk to the centre of Bristol. The noise from possibly the lift mechanism or air conditioning unit. We were on the 5th floor next to the elevators.
149,David,2023-11-13,Just the job Room was fine. Location excellent for town and railway station Breakfast was good Nothing
150,Em,2023-11-13,"Perfect for visiting the city Great location and parking Staff were superb. Friendly helpful and food in restaurant, room service and breakfast was great too. Bed was hard for me and also heating didn’t work but we managed to get a heater and extra duvet easily and sorted that out."
151,Dan,2023-11-13,"A good venue, with all what was needed, giving a good base for a quick visit. The location was good, friendly staff, convenient bar. Breakfast was decent too. Initially the wrong room was provided; with a double bed instead of 2 singles provided, but this was resolved, although mainly by my colleagues' quick thinking."
152,Tracy,2023-11-12,Good hotel. The reception staff were brilliant. So helpful and cheerful. Our Queen Room was beside the lift shaft so was really noisy 24 hours a day which was very annoying. Shower room as tiny.
153,Paula,2023-11-12,"Expensive for what it offers The bedroom is spacious and bright. The toilet has good amenities and lighting. It is good located not too far from the train station. The staff is really friendly and helpful The breakfast is simple and quite depressing. Most of the itens were missing, like pastries and fruits. There were no charcuteries, the bread was old and poor quality. The coffee was decent though"
154,Kai,2023-11-11,"Great stay! Friendly reception staff, quick and easy check in Friendly breakfast catering staff members, decent selection for breakfast Good room size Non-smart TV"
155,Val,2023-11-09,Comfortable hotel but some breakfast chaos. The property had big rooms and was clean. There were also two decent chairs to sit and watch the TV etc. The breakfast was okay but the tables were often not cleared for new diners and the food stocks had to be asked to replenished but weren’t.
156,Conrad,2023-11-09,Very good The breakfast was good No information about the local area in the room and a paper menu in the room would have helped.not everyone has a smart phone to scan barcodes
157,Terence,2023-11-08,"Convenient and comfortable. A good overnight stop. The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel itself was smart and quite conveniently located for walking to the old town. Breakfast was decent, if unexceptional and the price was good. A good option for an overnight stay in Bristol The hotel could have provided much more helpful information in advance: 1) Access to the hotel by car is complicated (not helped by road works/construction and Google maps thinking you can turn left off Temple Gate where you can't). Last time I stayed in Bristol, the hotel provided detailed driving directions for accessing it from various different directions - something similar would have been helpful. 2) The only information I had from the hotel about parking talked about an option for £20 a day. They omitted to mention the alternative car park 20 seconds walk away that is free overnight, and £2.50 an hour for up to 4 hours. The staff mentioned it, but only when I asked about alternatives if the hotel car park was full."
158,Ruby,2023-11-07,"Superb Really friendly staff, rooms were really nice with lots of storage Breakfast was unorganised. Me and my partner were sat flipped the ‘occupied’ counter provided with the table to get food only to come back to have to ask a couple to move after they’d been sat at our table by staff."
159,John,2023-11-06,"Excellent Clean, good staff, good value Coffee machine"
160,Michelle,2023-11-06,"Pleasant The breakfast was okay, short on cups and cutlery, had to ask for items. I think they need the check in for breakfast nearer the door, it was so busy people was just walking in and not queuing to be seated and helping them selves to breakfast, these could have been people whose not paid as they didn’t give a room number."
161,Andrea,2023-11-06,Superb Very comfortable Great breakfast included in the price Lovely staff Car park a little pricey
162,Rosie,2023-11-05,"Superb Convenient location, comfortable room, everyone working there was lovely, and great breakfast."
163,James,2023-11-05,"Pleasant overnight stay and made our journey easier for travelling to Devon. Breakfast was fine, as well as being located beside historic church building and some old public houses from a few hundred years. A difference in the air between the front and back of building. I thought hotel was not near the train station as we needed to get taxi to and from."
164,Sally,2023-11-05,Was fit for purpose for a one night stay but wouldn't return if there are other options. Location was handy for the train station. Nice touches in the room like a bath mat all the soaps and gels and fridge. Room was spacious bed was comfortable. It wasn't as modern as would have expected for a Hilton; there was a huge stain on the upholstered desk chair; stains all over the carpets and curtains too. Tea tray was okay but not exciting with no biscuits or fresh milk considering there was a fridge. And I hated having just a QR code for hotel information rather than some paper I could read and keep refer back to. TV half the channels didn't even work and guide was awful.
165,Naomi,2023-11-05,"Overall an excellent stopover. Staff extremely friendly, all very pleasant. Nice breakfast. Pillows far too soft."
166,Stephen,2023-11-04,Very good . .
167,Nicholas,2023-11-03,"Close to the rail station, not far from the cultural centre by the docks, excellent for short stay comfortable clean room, the heating system wasn't working adequately but we were provided with a supplementary heater, very good breakfast Everything was either adequate or good, no comnplaints"
168,Ioannis,2023-11-02,"Well located. Friendly staff. Nice rooms Well located, very close to the train station. The room was clean and well-sized with comfortable bed. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Nothing in particular. Maybe slightly overpriced but it’s pretty common lately due to the energy crisis."
169,Sivadnaj,2023-10-31,"Very good but could be even better Very comfortable, no fuss hotel. Helpful staff. Good location for Temple Meads rail station and useful bus connections. Good buffet breakfast. Enjoyed the fitness centre, especially Peloton. The air conditioning was not very responsive. We had to open the small windows to get some air flow and cool the room but then we had traffic noise from the road. The air con fan was too loud to have on for any length of time. Nowhere to hang damp towels to dry."
170,Callum,2023-10-31,"Central location and hearty breakfast. Great breakfast included in stay, clean good sized rooms. Car parking pricing at £20/night, but good to have the option."
171,Karen,2023-10-31,Great location for Bristol city centre and attractions Great location for the city centre. Easy access to the station on foot and walking distance from the main Bristol attractions.
172,Kryštof,2023-10-30,"Superb You get what you expect. Nice and clean hotel with good breakfast and nice staff. Kinda expensive, but worth it."
173,Vant,2023-10-30,"Not as good as a premiere inn staff were really friendly, no usb in the rooms which were a tad dated"
174,Tony,2023-10-30,"Good Good location, price, breakfast, clean and bright hotel No functioning air conditioning in very hot room and no alternative rooms available, no parking availability at hotel due to road closure with no prior warning to guests"
175,Joanne,2023-10-29,Superb Great location and welcoming staff.
176,Joanna,2023-10-27,"Convenient, clean and friendly Nice clean comfy room and great breakfast. Convenient location and good price."
177,Lee,2023-10-26,"Great hotel but lacking info on car park access. Nicely appointed room - did not look tired at all. Not too busy at breakfast. Good central location. Car park is visible along the main road, from which there is no entrance. Surrounding road system affords no real time to stop and think how to get into the car park. Clearer instructions with a postcode to the rear of the hotel would help."
178,Vicky,2023-10-25,Perfect base for exploring Bristol Fab location. Very comfortable room. Excellent choice at the breakfast buffet.
179,Mark,2023-10-25,I would choose this hotel again for sure. Nice welcome and quality of breakfast. Well thought out room arrangements to squeeze as much as possible into the small space.
180,Joanne,2023-10-25,"Great location, great staff unfortuantely let down by a disturbed nights sleep. The room was good and the staff were excellent - particularly the staff in the restaurant who were very conscientious with our dietary requirements. Our tv turned on at full volume at 04.29 in the morning. This may have been some preset alarm setup by a previous occupant but clearly not ideal. If this is an option it would be useful to either turn it off or have the staff reset it each time the room is vacated."
181,Brian,2023-10-22,Good  Parking payment. No free breakfast
182,Nigel,2023-10-21,Good Handy for the train station and city centre Small room and expensive
183,Titilia,2023-10-20,"Location was convenient and was clean Location and how clean it was The mattress was uncomfortable, spring bed and not levelled."
184,Giacomo,2023-10-20,Good Great breakfast
185,Bob,2023-10-20,"Friendly and Polite staff with an excellent welcome factor. Good size room and excellent facilities, very comfortable bed. Ideal location as I travelled by train and the venue for my function was only 5 minutes walk. Not so good walking back late night through the park opposite as there was a distinctive smell of cannabis, would have taken a different route if known but the times we live in, I guess. I felt that the price was high as the hotel only really compared to other cheaper chain hotels. Yes, the restaurant was better but was only used it for a quick buffet breakfast as I was in Bristol for a function. Speaking with other people met at the function I would look elsewhere if visiting Bristol again as they appeared to get a better deal financially."
186,Dawn,2023-10-18,"Very enjoyable Good breakfast, nice staff. Good location. We got lost on the way from the train station, on foot, and ended up going the back way round a lot of building works. Then discovered how close it was to the station the next day."
187,Katherine,2023-10-18,"A very nice place to stay at a reasonable price. Well designed room, clean, nice controllable temperature, comfortable bed, well lit bathroom, very good breakfast, good location. The rooms at the back overlook a park. Nothing really."
188,Pauline,2023-10-16,"Excellent We found the staff so helpful and friendly. In particular, we had an issue with our booking which Peter resolved beyond our expectations. Location was also excellent. The bed was a bit too firm."
189,Christopher,2023-10-16,A very enjoyable and comfortable stay. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Car parking at the hotel is a bit expensive.
190,Jennifer,2023-10-15,Very good Easy to locate near the train station and tourist areas. Very welcoming and knowledgeable reception person. Large comfortable bed. Room good size. Decor pleasing. Large coffee cups. Lift
191,Elaine,2023-10-14,Peter Front of House made our trip as did the Restaurant staff .. loved the access to Temple Gardens The rooms overlooking the road
192,Chan,2023-10-14,"Superb Totally good, I like it"
193,Michael,2023-10-13,Very good good location between train and city centre temperature in restaurant- aggressive aircon
194,Philip,2023-10-11,Very pleasant (hope this counts as a sentence). Staff explaining breakfast procedure to me as new Hilton customer. Having a biscuit with the teamaker (!).
195,Elizabeth,2023-10-10,"Superb Good location, great breakfast, helpful staff, clean room, comfortable beds."
196,Katixa,2023-10-09,"Quiet and comfortable stay Comfortable, quiet, nice bed and desk. Friendly staff. Really close to the railway station. More fresh fruit at the breakfast buffet please!"
197,Mark,2023-10-09,"Great stay , very poor breakfast though Everything about it was great to be honest, expect the breakfast was very poor The breakfast was very poor quality, the bacon was cold, greasy and rock hard, the mushrooms were dried up, the scrambled egg was all dried up, and sausages were cold, all in all very poor standard"
198,Joe,2023-10-07,"Necessary Welcome good, comfortable clean room. No biscuits and after a long Fri e could ha e done with one Think overpriced for the one night Pricing not value formoney"
199,Ellen,2023-10-05,Comfortable stay. Quite central. Easy to reach city centre and Temple Mead Rail Station. Nice Temple Garden to Victoria Street. Love the Clean fresh Bath Towels and Bed very comfortable. Room Brightly lit. Ample Coffee and Tea given in room . Room a bit small. The fridge not working. Shower door cannot close properly.
200,Guillaume,2023-10-02,"Very good It is a nice hotel in the city centre. Breakfast was good but basic (nothing extravagant, the bread was good though, coffee could be better). We really appreciate the fact that it provide parking possibilities. The staff was friendly and happy to help if needed"
201,Kay,2023-10-02,"Well located with easy parking and good value Parking is very handy, quiet room, breakfast was very good. Queen sized bed was rather small but King-size are available"
202,Michelle,2023-10-02,A good stay Staff were amazing. hotel was clean. The mattress was very hard and uncomfortable
203,Della,2023-09-30,Very good Location Nothing - all good
204,Basak,2023-09-28,"Good Very helpful staff, very clean room Construction view really uncomfortable could not open my curtains for the entire stay. Restaurant was always super busy whenever i was there breakfast and dinner."
205,Stephanie,2023-09-27,Nice hotel Great location near the train station. Staff were friendly Wasn't there long enough. No issues
206,Amy,2023-09-25,"Very good Excellent price and location, modern hotel, clean room and comfortable bed. Not the most welcoming on arrival at lunchtime. I expected more from a Hilton hotel."
207,Guy,2023-09-24,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
208,Jan,2023-09-22,"Very good Room comfortable & excellent breakfast. Also handy for places of interest, shops etc. Tricky to find hotel car park as lots of construction work going on but obviously not fault of hotel."
209,Ana,2023-09-20,"Very good Super helpful staff. Great breakfast. Perfect location, in between the train station and the city center. Comfortable bed. It's a bit old and outdated, but it's still comfortable. The carpet floors always look a bit dirty, but that's normal in UK."
210,Karys,2023-09-19,Just right for the purpose of my trip. The room was spacious and comfy and the bathroom was clean and functional (I liked the fact there was a proper shower rather than an over the bath shower). The location was a 2 minute walk from my work venue and the variety at breakfast was reasonable. The staff were excellent. The hotel is in quite a noisy part of Bristol - perhaps some extra sound proofing in rooms would be good as I was woken several times by traffic and other guests just entering/exiting rooms/ the sound of the lift pinging.
211,Lynn,2023-09-19,Superb Modern clean hotel in business district Cafes and pubs close by A little way out from city centre but bus stop is outside the hotel and the water ferry is a short walk away
212,Orkun,2023-09-18,"Very good stay Staff was very helpful, breakfast was ok, they have gluten free option. Nothing"
213,Camilla,2023-09-18,Hilton is Hilton The service Nothing
214,Ana,2023-09-18,It was good - too expensive though for one night Pleasant space overall . Hilton chain best beds … Noisy location. Ambulance sirens main dual carriage way .
215,Flo,2023-09-17,"Comfortable affordable hotel in central bristol Central location, near the train station, comfortable bed and good Buffett breakfast No complaints"
216,Mandy,2023-09-17,Very good  There was building work very close which closed the road leading to the Hilton car park. Took us 20 minutes to find another way in and had to ask in the end. The hotel need to advise guests in advance of easier ways to access the car park whilst the building continues. In fact the whole of Bristol is a building site.
217,Sascha,2023-09-15,"Great location for a business trip to Bristol I had a wonderful stay. The room was big enough for one person and everything was very clean. The bed was comfortable and the walls are not as paper-thin as in many other hotels. I enjoyed the breakfast as well. Although the gym was relatively small, all equipment worked and was clean. Nothing really."
218,Dafni14k,2023-09-13,"Very good The room was very clean, the personnel was very polite and helpful. The location is a great walking distance from the main train station. There was a constant noise in the room and it felt like they were doing constructions from outside, which was not the case. The room temperature couldn't be adjusted so we woke up with a cold. At the entrance, there was a very strong scent/perfume and accelerated our cold :("
219,Barbara,2023-09-11,Exceptional service from all staff members. Reception staff very helpful at check in and check out. Restaurant staff also give great service. Room rather small but clean and adequate. Room smaller than expected.
220,Desmond,2023-09-09,Lovely stay Very well located
221,Mary,2023-09-08,I wish it was longer had to leave personal problems 😞 I only stayed in the room for 2 hours I had to leave family problems 🥺 Everything was lovely
222,Etches,2023-09-03,"Very good Great location for purpose of visit (nearby wedding). Room had a wetroom - brilliant! The seat within the shower are was dirty, in between its slats. I know it's difficult - but cooked breakfast items were cold!"
223,Lydia,2023-09-03,"Great location, clean and comfortable. Good breakfast and great value for money Everything was great! Nothing"
224,Diane,2023-09-03,Excellent choice for access to airport and city centre. Very good customer service - warm friendly staff. Modern comfortable room with very friendly staff. Room overlooking gardens and old monastery very pleasant. Very convenient for the airport bus!! Breakfast is well worth the money. Nothing to dislike
225,Neil,2023-09-01,Very good Nice Car park charge
226,Jessica,2023-08-31,Good How walkable the distance was from the station and softness of bed and cushions Shower went cold quite easily when used late in the morning.
227,Ahu,2023-08-31,"Very good... Great location, private car park, clean room, delicious breakfast, etc... Staying at Hilton is always a good idea..."
228,Duncan,2023-08-31,Superb near train and Wetherspoons Knights Temple. Busses handy. staff helpful thanks. no non-slip patch in bath under the shower.
229,Nicola,2023-08-31,"Friendly staff, great breakfast Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was nice. Cost of parking was a little excessive. Forgot to ensure there was no feather duvets or pillows in the rooms. However, this was soon rectified and we were given a drink as compensation."
230,Ian,2023-08-30,"Despite the problems accessing the hotel and parking the car, the hotel itself was very good. Staff were very friendly. Very good breakfast. I spent 30 minutes going around in cirlces trying to find the way into the hotel car park to get to reception. In the end I had to drop my wife off to go to the hotel on foot and then make 2 turnings that I was not supposed to make. On arrival it was explained that I should have gone through the archaway marked ""Novotel Car Park Only"". Easier access and plentiful, clear direction signs need to be provided. Parking was difficult due to the limited spaces in the hotel, so I had to park in the council car park and then pay a charge by 8am next morning, until a space became available in the hotel car park (£20 for 24 hours). Not a great system!"
231,Nicola,2023-08-29,"Good stay Location of hotel is good. The breakfast tables were not cleared quick enough. we were told to find a table and there were not any clean ones, we had to ask for them to be cleared."
232,Ellie,2023-08-29,"Very enjoyable, would stay again. Clean room, comfy bed, very nice bathroom Would be nice to see some biscuits/ snacks on the tea tray."
233,Ágnes,2023-08-29,Superb The breakfast was very nice with a good range of options and the receptionist welcoming me was very kind.
234,Siu,2023-08-29,A good and convenient hotel The location was convenient. The breakfast was good. it would be better if the double room could be providedwuth two chairs instead of one .
235,Mumdooh,2023-08-29,"fascinating Liked the location, breakfast and staff prompt response. I had an issue relating to Air conditioner in my room at late night, But a big thanks to Sasha from the reception team who instantaneously organized a replacement room and moved me into a new room. Although the hotel has a car park, the spaces seem limited. To me that was a thing but anyone who doesn’t think this as issue wouldn’t be bothered."
236,Thùy,2023-08-29,"We have a pleasant stay. We will return if the chance arises. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, so it's easy for us to go to the centre of the city. It's rather close to the train station as well. We arrived at Bristol by train, and it took us about 5~7 minutes to walk to the hotel (with our heavy luggage behind). We didn't try the breakfast, but we had dinner at the hotel restaurant. The atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant, and the food is good (we ordered some hot soup, salad, and Buffalo wings). I would like to compliment the ones who cleaned our room for treating my plushie with care. The room is small, but with this affordable price, it's good enough. I have one complaint about the fridge in our room. We weren't sure if the fridge was working or broken, but it wasn't cold enough to store our ice cream and yoghurt. I hope that it will be fixed or improved."
237,Shannon,2023-08-29,"Good Location was great, 6min walk from the station and tesco express nearby. Room was lovely and the staff made towel swans which was a nice touch. Great value for money and would definitely stay again. The breakfast wasn’t great- sausages and bacon seemed like they had been out for a a while."
238,Rabia,2023-08-28,Lovely place and great breakfast Lovely breakfast with a large selection of food and even a waffle making machine to make fresh waffles with a range of toppings. Can request eggs how you like them cooked and can request veggie option sausages too for breakfast. Staff was very friendly and very helpful so a BIG THANK YOU! Shower was amazing with lovely soaps and body lotions
239,David,2023-08-27,A good location and price for my short visit. Location and room were good for my brief visit Some areas of the hotel need improvement but generally good value.
240,Maire,2023-08-27,"Ideal location for a short break in Bristol. The location of this hotel is ideal, a few minutes walking distance from both Temple Meads Bus/Train Station and the city centre. A very good breakfast is served, with plenty of choices. We were able to leave our luggage at reception on the morning of our departure and collect it that evening as we had a late flight. Nothing."
241,Justin,2023-08-27,"very pleasant short stay comfortable room, good location"
242,Andrea,2023-08-27,"Better than expected stay & good value off-weekend The staff at checkin were very friendly, and gave me a room that I asked for facing the garden. Thus my room was nice and quiet, with negligible from traffic noise until after 7am. The bed is comfortable and it's great to have both a kettle and a mini fridge. The included breakfast was very good, with nicely cooked poached eggs to order. The location is very convenient both for the railway station but also lovely walks along the Harbour area. Only tiny things were an annoyance: even when off there is a low hum from the air conditioning and the room could do with more plugs at the bedside for charging phones and other equipment. Finally, it would be nice to have a better assortment of herbal tea bags, such as chamomile and peppermint, rather than predominantly regular tea"
243,Nicole,2023-08-26,"perfect for a night to stay, if for more days, I would prefer to have a place more quiet great breakfast choices, clean and comfy room location was okay, but the noise of the street/cars were a little anoying"
244,Tess,2023-08-26,Very good  lack of parking
245,Jamey,2023-08-25,Great hotel for a city break. The location was a 5 minute walk from the railway station. Pedestrian friendly. Check-in was speedy and efficient. A special mention for Nikita who checked us in and was more then helpful with the choice of room. The hotel was 10minutes walk away form the Old Town. Lots of history and great bars and eateries. So much to choose from. Breakfast was self service and plentiful with a good selection of food. Our room was small but very comfortable. More Tea Bags in the room.
246,Ionut,2023-08-24,"Outstanding staff, thank you everyone. Owners could invest in some renovations The staff was the best thing about the location. Everyone was so accommodating and friendly. Peter stood out, he’s a manager or boss or something, and he’s leading by example. Also, the food was outstanding. The chicken and rice dish was amazing, don’t remember the name of it. Not to be attributed to the staff, but the hotel could use some renovations. I imagine that’s up to the owners. There’s a particular smell throughout the hallway, but the room was excellent and clean. The furniture is not amazing, as it’s a bit older, but the cleaning staff did their job very well."
247,Graham,2023-08-24,Value for money Parking is awful. You allow people to park in no parking zones
248,David,2023-08-24,"Ship-shape and Bristol fashion! This is a modern hotel with everything that you’d expect. The bed was spacious and extremely comfortable, breakfast in the morning had a very good selection, and all of the staff that we interacted with were helpful and friendly, especially Annie(?) at the front desk. A late check-out and storage of bags were offered, rather than asked for. Good city location near Temple Meads, but, that also means you’re close to a busy road."
249,Elaine,2023-08-21,"Air conditioning in room didn’t work, although we were offered a fan it was very hot and we couldn’t have the window ope Good location for rail link, good breakfast Not close to amenities"
250,Eve,2023-08-21,Bad management Good breakfast. Clean room with comfy beds. My son was locked in his room after the door failed to open from inside. It took over an hour as we were told we would have to wait for a locksmith to arrive. The staff on reception were useless and most unhelpful given the circumstances as was the hotel manager when we asked for an explanation for how this could happen. He never even apologised! Very disappointing in terms of health and safety..
251,Karen,2023-08-20,"Superb Very Central, everything In walking distance"
252,Jimmy,2023-08-19,perfect location for a relaxing quiet city break the room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was good quality but the notable point for me was the friendliness of the staff who were very obliging also there is a nice small park across the road and the hotel is walking distance from temple meads train station where the airport flyer bus stops all good
253,Amie,2023-08-19,Europe travelling. Great location. Clean and comfortable room.
254,Amira,2023-08-18,Perfect for a short stay East central location with onsite parking (although you have to pay for it) Small fridge
255,Ruth,2023-08-18,Good  Xarpet was badly stained in bedroom
256,Albert,2023-08-18,Just what I wanted It’s location Cost of parking
257,Clive,2023-08-17,"Good time with young and old. Easy walking distance from the train station, even for my elderly parents. Also, many walkable places to visit. We went to Bath by train for a day out too. The room was a little warm for me and the AC didn't cool it enough."
258,Evans,2023-08-17,"Excellent Reasonable room with functional bathroom and shower. Position, easy walk into the city centre."
259,Ward,2023-08-17,Very good N/a N/a
260,Ann,2023-08-15,"Very good. Breakfast was good thanks. I'm gluten intolerant, the staff were helpful in providing me with toast & cereal which I don't often find in other hotels or bnbs. Not enough decaffeinated tea bags in room. Shower was. Not easy to regulate, either too hot or cold."
261,Rosemary,2023-08-14,"Good overnight stop for the airport. Good location for Airport Flyer bus from Temple Meads station to airport. Clean room, bed a little hard, very quiet. Dinner limited menu but satisfactory, breakfast good choice but cooked food tepid."
262,Andrew,2023-08-14,Nice clean hotel would stay again. Good clean hotel good selection for breakfast. Rooms abit small especially the bathroom.
263,Stuart,2023-08-14,"Very good Nice walk to the centre and river, good breakfast, excellent Sardinian restaurant a short stroll across the square Room not the biggest"
264,Mark,2023-08-13,"We would stay again Great location, comfortable room. Trying to find the entrance to the carpark was very difficult due to current roadworks, so new temporary signage is desperately required. Breakfast food quality wasn’t great."
265,Joan,2023-08-13,Good value and comfortable. Very welcoming and helpful staff. Short walk from the station. Although the breakfast was well prepared and presented the quality of the ingredients didn’t match the Hilton of old.
266,Pauline,2023-08-13,"Convenient for trains and buses, sadly wouldn’t stay again Very clean Chair with broken arms (dangerous) in room Absolutely NO info in room, eg restaurant menu, breakfast times etc Restaurant not busy but we didn’t get our starter! Extortionate price for tiny bottle of tonic water £3.35!"
267,Lorraine,2023-08-13,Fine.  No complimentary water in the room.
268,Tim,2023-08-09,"Simply great Friendly staff, although the chef at breakfast came across a little bit annoyed when I made a small and honest mistake like I’m some sort of child. Seems like a nice guy though, but he could have handled that better. The hotel was close to the station which makes it easy to get to another place and back. The location is nice and the price is the best amongst all competition. The breakfast was nice, lots of options, but in my opinion also a bit simple. All in all it’s very much worth your money, I’ve enjoyed it very much staying there. If you are just looking for a nice and easy place to stay, this is a great option. But if you want to make your stay a bit more special, maybe go for another hotel. It’s a little bit of an old hotel, not really modern. Could be charming but you don’t expect it at Hilton’s."
269,Brian,2023-08-08,"Positive experience and would book again. Bedroom was a good size with comfortable bed.very clean. All the staff were amazing, so friendly and willing to help. Breakfast was good. Only thing I would have preferred is to have a bath as well as a shower."
270,Malika,2023-08-08,"Returning customer Comfortable rooms, great location. Expensive parking. Restaurant menu limited. Food very average, service rather uneven’"
271,Pauline,2023-08-08,We felt really comfortable here. It was lovely and clean Nothing
272,David,2023-08-08,"Good value for money, would stay again Room was good value, staff were very helpful when asked anything, breakfast was ok. Breakfast lacked basic continental products,ie no yoghurt, no butter, only flora margarine, no croissants, Also no tomato with the cooked breakfast,slow to replenish the cooked items, so you were waiting with plate in hand with your breakfast going cold,waiting for items to be replenished"
273,Brenda,2023-08-06,"Disappointed The room was clean mostly. The toilet didn't flush properly. Took about 3 or 4 flushes each time. Very noisy from road traffic and seagulls. Parking was expensive. Breakfast was all over the place, couldn't find what I wanted right away. By the time I got coffee, my breakfast was cold."
274,Claire,2023-08-06,"Great location and lovely staff Friendly staff, fridge in room, powerful shower, good location Noise levels from other guests, bathroom too small to dry yourself so had to go into bedroom to do that, too many chairs blocking the room which was fairly small. There was a cracked sink and peeling ceiling in the bathroom. A better variety of tea and coffee making facilities would have been nice for the price. It was very basic and the one teabag I did use tasted like it was very old. The cooked breakfast was not good and the berry juice I had was incredibly sugary. More fresh options would have been better it all felt very cheap on the breakfast front which was a shame as the staff were very nice there"
275,Paul,2023-08-05,"Nice comfortable stay good choice of food and drinks at breakfast and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was in a good location and was very clean with lovely fluffy towels, toiletries. Even had an ironing board and iron available in the room. trying to find the hotel wasn't easy using satnav."
276,Forence,2023-08-05,"Superb Breakfast was lovely. Staff at the Recess were very courteous and efficient. Housekeeping staff very hardworking and good at their job. Love the gym, had basic equipments for workouts. Love that they kept clean towels for use during workout and hydration and sanitation stations. We flew into Bristol at 11am and knew check in was 3pm, the hotel was able to keep our bags for us which was nice. But, when we came back at 3pm, the room wasn't ready and we had to wait for more than 30 minutes."
277,Julie,2023-08-04,"Very good Rooms were nice, good location for shops and train station We had 2 rooms. One room air con was good mother room so hot! But they did bring us a fan which helped hugely"
278,Susan,2023-08-04,"Really enjoyed our stay a great hotel with lovely staff & excellent facilities we would recommend. Location excellent Quiet when indoors Modern facilities Clean Excellent value Friendly, helpful, polite staff Breakfast was plentiful & good quality, the staff in the dining room were exceptional Room was a little small for 2 mature females who need access especially around wardrobe & desk area. We will request a slightly more spacious room next time."
279,Denise,2023-08-01,"Beautiful hotel with friendly and helpful staff Beautiful hotel, smart and clean with good parking facilities. Gentleman on reception was amazing and helpful, wish I could remember his name. Went out of his way to help me with my daughter's graduation. One of the rooms I was given was right next to the lift (didn't get this room until after 9pm) and it was not until my younger daughter had got undressed and ready for bed and switched the air conditioning off that I realised you could hear the lift. It did keep me awake most of the night, but as my daughter was asleep I couldn't wake her up to move. I had asked for quiet rooms away from the lifts and stairs (I had two rooms). Also no tomatoes at breakfast, although everything else was good."
280,Mariana,2023-07-31,"Clean hotel, friendly staff and good location. Good location near Bristol Temple Meads station and clean rooms. Nothing all good."
281,Lily,2023-07-31,Ok Staff were very helpful and friendly. Our aircon didn’t work we asked but couldn’t be fixed but we didn’t get asked if we wanted to move it was very very hot! I asked for a low room due to a knee injury and this wasn’t taking in I even reminded them on arrival. We were second floor and I had to walk half way down the hallway. There was loose nails/carpet tacks? Not sure what’s they are called between bathroom and bedroom and I cut my feet multiple times. Glasses weren’t clean fridge wasn’t cold.
282,David,2023-07-30,"Very good, great location and very quiet in the rooms despite being very busy Very clean room And bathroom, the Egyptian cotton towels were exceptionally soft and white. Breakfast was fantastic with a huge selection of food types and the coffee was superb. It’s a very busy hotel so obviously gets a lots of wear and tear. The paintwork And woodwork is starting to show sign a of this but nothing untoward… One thing that does need addressing is the way all the dirty linens and towels Are Left on corridors way after cleaning times and into the evening. Looks Unsightly and is actually a bit of a hazard."
283,Gemma,2023-07-30,Perfect Everything Couldn’t find so had to call. No food late in evening.
284,Eleonor,2023-07-29,Good The mirrors and bathroom
285,Boulden,2023-07-27,"Very good Helpfully & happy staff,great location. Air con in room was not sufficient as even on a wet weekend the room was too warm."
286,Cheng,2023-07-26,Good The room is really clean and the staff are super friendly.
287,Valerie,2023-07-24,"OK, pleasant enough, but not memorable. Location was handy for the station and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. Breakfast was OK, but a little underwhelming. Generally felt we could have done a bit better at a Premier Inn."
288,Amorelle,2023-07-23,Bristol stopover Proximity. Lovely staff. When I booked it said I’d been upgraded but that didn’t seem to be the case as room was nice but quite basic. Bathroom small. I paid £159 and on day the cost was much cheaper on booking.com.
289,Anna,2023-07-23,A very corporate hotel Nothing stood out Nothing stood out
290,Tina,2023-07-23,Good for 1 night Well equipped. Lovely soft pillows. Good choice at breakfast. They will make your eggs how you like.. I had an incredible omlette! Very strong smell of aftershave scented air freshener in lifts and corrdors etc. Breakfast area very spread out and un-cordinated. Waffle maker not working (but other choices available).
291,Stephanie,2023-07-22,"Loved the location but hotel very impersonal Location and comfortable Drinks in bar very expensive, food very average"
292,Dominic,2023-07-22,Great Very pleasant receptionists Fresh coffee at breakfast would be nice the machine coffee was awful
293,Nicholas,2023-07-21,Great location Location Breakfast poor over cooked
294,Evans,2023-07-20,"Reasonable, comfortable well positioned hotel. Reasonable room good location and if you manage to get a car parking spot it is helpful and a lot cheaper than most other car parks. You cannot book a car park spot in advance. The Bar area was not great. Lifts got very busy at peak times so we walked to our room."
295,Jennie,2023-07-20,"Perfect Superb room, very clean and in good condition. Very quiet despite being in the City centre. Very comfy bed with good quality linen and thick towels."
296,Laura,2023-07-18,Good Location great Parking ok.... paid car park very close as limited spaces at actual hotel Staff friendly and helpful Room very clean Breakfast very average Bed not very comfortable
297,Jonathan,2023-07-17,Very good  I’d prefer a different way to pay for parking. £20 for 24 hours but only parked overnight. Either charge per night or allow partial payment
298,Patrick,2023-07-17,Very good Waited 15min for a table
299,Jenny,2023-07-16,"Excellent hotel Clean, comfortable rooms, excellent breakfast, great staff and lovely bar Rooms are very small"

302,Portia,2023-07-13,Very good Great location and very clean. Room was a good size and had a lovely view. Bathroom too small and sink was way too close to the shower. There was also no plug socket on one side of the bed.
303,Stephen,2023-07-12,"Bristol Weekend Location was very good and Hotel facilities very good. Helpful friendly staff. Breakfast seating, had to wait for 15 minutes for table , arrived around 9.30. Staff though were helpful and kept us informed about the table availability."
304,D,2023-07-11,All good. No Complaints at all. No complaints at all. Perfect for 1 night in Bristol. Thanks.
305,Anita,2023-07-10,"Basic but decent night's stay Good location. Right by the park and ride stop, which was very convenient and much cheaper and better than paying the onsite parking fee. Breakfast very nice. Staff friendly and helpful. Hotel clean but felt very basic. Twin beds not full size, narrow and uncomfortable. Just a king bed unzipped, which we had to wait for despite booking and checking via unanswered messages. Small and basic bathroom. Small and very basic reception area. I did expect more from a Hilton Hotel, to be honest."
306,Angela,2023-07-09,"It was a very good stay so frustrating that we were charged twice by the restaurant. It was comfortable, clean and convenient to the station. The restaurant charged our bank account twice for one meal which is frustrating when travelling."
307,Susan,2023-07-07,Good location and facilities. Convenient location and quiet Long queue to check in and inability to reserve parking space. Plus car covered in tree sap.
308,Evans,2023-07-06,Good Location was very good.
309,Im,2023-07-03,"Good Easy walking distance from Bristol Temple Meads, which was very handy when arriving late at night after a flight from Belfast. Breakfast was pretty solid; it was a rather cold morning, so the porridge was very welcome."
310,Helen,2023-07-03,Very good Room great size and bathroom very clean. Breakfast was good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. A/C was noisy and couldn't turn it off. The tv didn't work and there were no rooms to move to
311,Lorenzo,2023-07-02,"Affordable but high quality of stay. Location, breakfast."
312,Anthony,2023-06-30,"Very nice location and enjoyable stay in Bristol The staff were very helpful. Rooms were clean. Location was quiet. The breakfast was good with a nice selection. It is easy to walk to the city centre & river. Car parking was useful albeit limited spaces & £20:00 fee for 24 hours.. Bristol is a very interesting city to visit. We enjoyed our brief stay. We would recommend this hotel. Due to developments in the area, there are a number of diversions. I found it quite tricky getting to the car park, the SAT NAV kept asking to to turn down NO ENTRY roads ! There are trees that overhang the car park. In the summer these deposit sticky sap - so be be prepared to give your car a good wash when you get home! That is a minor point, not intended to be negative regarding the quality of this hotel."
313,Rupinder,2023-06-26,"Lovely and what I needed for one night stay Staff were wonderful and I felt safe :) Decor looks a little tired, marks on wall and carpet and air con was very noisy it kept waking me up"
314,Carrie,2023-06-25,Lovely hotel! Room was comfortable and breakfast was tasty with lots of choice! Great bar and outside seating area over- looking a green park area. Comfortable bed and good shower! Shower door would not stay fully closed. Not many parking spaces so had to park in another car park.
315,Brian,2023-06-25,"Good location and staff, room not great Reception staff (esp the older chap) This room was supposed to be an upgrade by booking.com but was on par with Travelodge. No USBs in room Room too warm even with a/c lowest temp setting Not enough tea bags or milk No biscuits!"
316,Ben,2023-06-23,Was good Location and breakfast great A bit out dated and building works going on
317,Janet,2023-06-23,"Very good The hotel was a five minute walk from the station . The breakfast was very good and the staff very friendly and helpful .

342,Anwen,2023-05-28,"Good location and parking on site. Friendly staff . Anne from reception came out and down the street to direct us to the hotel because road closures meant that the route was blocked, we were really grateful to her for this. parking is expensive. Make sure you pay clean air tax - not very clear notices about this and could end up in a hefty fine !"

346,Illia,2023-05-25,"Good brand-standard hotel A nice hotel from brand, but has not much personality: - Very clean - Sound insulation is good, was quite in room, counting fact that windows were reaching big road - Location is good: very close to train station, kinda border of city center, but Bristol is small, so everything were reachable by foot - Nice park near hotel - Typical english breakfast could be more rich with fruits and vegetables - Food was the same everyday - Room is pretty small only 12 sqm - Asked slippers two times, got second pair only on second attempt"
347,Zsuzsanna,2023-05-24,Very good The bar was really nice.
348,Beatrice,2023-05-24,"Nice stay in Bristol The location was good and staff members were friendly and helpful. There were certain items missing during Monday morning breakfast (fruit yogurt - there was only plain yogurts, not the same fresh fruit selection etc.) Also the croissants were not properly baked - there was raw dough in the middle of the pastry."
349,David,2023-05-23,Great short stay to see a Gig at the Fleece Excellent stay. Nice staff and food very good. Additional cost for parking but I guess that’s standard now.
350,John,2023-05-23,"Comfortable stay but access not straightforward Room was compact but sufficient for a one night stay. Handy for the city centre and train station. Breakfast was all self-service and plentiful. Difficult to access by car as the postcode/satnav just leaves you on the main road from where the hotel is not accessible. It's necessary to arrive via the backstreets from where it is not signposted and all complicated by building works in the neighbourhood leading to road closures. Only after booking did I receive a message saying that there was limited parking at the hotel on a first come first served basis and that it would cost £20, which wasn't apparent when booking. Stayed on a Sunday night, so fortunately did get a space at the hotel."
351,Trevor,2023-05-21,Superb It was lovely Staff were lovely
352,Rachael,2023-05-21,"Very good  Air con wouldn't turn off, shower door wouldn't close properly"
353,Robbie,2023-05-20,"ideal for short night stay staff, location, gym, pillows bed not comfy , rooms could do with modern decor"
354,Curtis,2023-05-18,"Good location, nice room - Brilliant staff. The location was the main attraction, 5-minute walk from harbour-side. Also great breakfast and staff. The room needed some TLC in the bathroom but it was perfectly clean! Rooms are due an update but they are as clean as they can be and very comfortable. All communal areas are updated and nice to be in."
355,Rob,2023-05-17,"great hotel, will stay again staff and great breakfast options a bit overpriced"
356,Roger,2023-05-15,Superb What you would expect from a Hilton. First morning at breakfast restaurant absolutely choc-a-bloc wine 3 group tours in hotel. Was unable to get breakfast until after 9am.( Hotel already knows of this problem from their own survey request)
357,Georgia,2023-05-15,"Good Staff were extremely lovely and dealt with our requests with no complaints. Beds were super comfy, location is pretty good, and the bar in the evening time is a really great space. Our bathroom ceiling was peeling off and our plug was broken, so water didn't filter down the sink. It was manageable because we went out in the daytime and maintenance had sorted it by then but it would've been an even better stay if the plug wasn't broken."
358,Gary,2023-05-14,Very good Comfortable quiet room Very small ensuite shower room
359,Caroline,2023-05-14,"Highly recommend this hotel if you need a place to stay near the railway station The staff were lovely. There was good variety at breakfast, including make your own waffles. The room was small but had everything I needed and was very clean. There was no parking on site, as it was full, but the staff directed me to a car park literally opposite the entrance and it worked out cheaper to park there. I liked everything."
360,Michael,2023-05-12,Superb Location Great breakfast
361,Jason,2023-05-09,Comfortable & well placed near Temple Meads but make sure you don't get the room next to the gym. Staff really welcoming and helpful. Room and hotel was clean and comfortable. Woken abruptly at 7am by banging/thudding noise that went on intermittently for 20-30min. Turns out it was a guy in the hotel gym directly opposite my room slamming a dumb-bell into the ground.
362,Eleanor,2023-05-06,"Fresh, Clean, Superb Stay for a Singleton! Room was tidy, clean and quiet. Bed was comfy. Bathroom was clean and bright with nice smelling toiletries and fluffy towels. TV and remote worked and plenty of channels. Coffee bar in bedroom was nice with quiet boiling kettle. Desk and chair were great. Breakfast was lovely--easy instructions to use the waffle maker, which tables were vacant/occupied and where to get drinks. Surrounded by office buildings (quiet on weekends but gave a professional vibe). Could have been more fresh fruit available at breakfast. Elevator chimer bell could have been turned off or on silent during the night (like 23:00-7:00) as rooms near the elevator could hear the elevator bell during those times. Ran out of pastries at breakfast and they weren't replenished quickly."
363,Robert,2023-05-06,The parking should be free as the price of the stay is getting dearer Breakfast and location
364,Arthur,2023-05-04,"Superb Excellent location, very close to the train station and walking distance to restaurants, shops, etc Great staff, very friendly and helpful! Excellent breakfast"
365,Slatter,2023-05-04,"Very good Very clean hotel and smelt beautiful, staff were very helpful Breakfast wasn't cooked quite enough but a nice selection."
366,Raymond,2023-05-04,"Good hotel but noisy location and poor A/C Clean, modern and tidy. Car parking outside. Nice bar, food and a quiet outdoor verandah to enjoy a drink on rattan sofas. Service was excellent. Too near a busy main road and traffic noise from 4am even with windows shut. Rear rooms are available though. A/C was poor, the controller didn’t work as per the instructions and the fan noise was on and off all night and the room cooled a little but it was stuffy. Uncomfortable sleep. It’s not really near a good choice of restaurants or bars and a taxi is required. The extra service charge added to restaurant service."
367,Paul,2023-05-03,Very good Excellent breakfast service - location is great for centre of city
368,Amy,2023-05-02,great location and price location bed a bit hard and not enough pillows
369,Robert,2023-05-02,"Overnight in Bristol. This is a good business hotel in the developing area of the city towards Temple Meads. We chose the Hilton Garden rather than our usual Hilton Double Tree on the basis of a free breakfast and a room upgrade. The breakfast was fine. I think the room upgrade consisted of a larger bed in a normal sized room, and as a result we found the room and bathroom a bit cramped compared with the Hilton Doubletree which is an older hotel. But overall it was a good place to stay. The outlook from the restaurant, over the Temple Gardens, was particularly pleasant. Our room, at the from of the hotel, faced onto the dual carriageway Temple Way and traffic noise was noticeable at certain times."
370,Helen,2023-05-02,"Superb Room was very clean, staff were friendly, and professional, breakfast was amazing!!"
371,Lana,2023-05-02,"Good The hotel is situated very close to the central part of Bristol, it's easy to get anywhere from it. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Parking - we were told we had to pay for a 24-hour stay at the car park, there was even a sign at the reception. However, the parking does not belong to the hotel and we only found out after leaving that we could have paid far less, given that the car didn't even stay there for 12 hours."
372,Paul,2023-05-01,lovely clean hotel. 5 minute walk to station for airport bus bar
373,Haigh,2023-05-01,Very good Bedroom ok Cost too high .difficult access to the car park needs sign posting to get into car park
374,Donna,2023-04-29,Superb restaurant the bed was uncomfortable lumpy
375,Lorraine,2023-04-27,We travelled in a group of 6 and we all said we would be happy to use this hotel again. Staff were friendly and efficient. The location worked perfectly. The standard of cleanliness was very good. Building work noise ( but no fault of the hotel ) Rather a lack of places to sit that were not In restaurant. The door key cards were hit and miss at working - however staff were always quick to respond.
376,Wen,2023-04-25,"last minute booking for a weekend stay with good experience breakfast spread are good . and the staff customer service are superb. Parking is charged at 20GBP which is standard for this location/area. despite the new look, i feel the hotel interior are kind old fashion. i,e: no USB charging point near the bed."
377,A,2023-04-24,Very good staff / cleanliness bed was very creaky

380,Stephen,2023-04-20,Very good Staff were very professional and helpful Size of room and especially toilet room
381,Jazmin,2023-04-19,"Good for a night out. Staff were great, lobby was lovely. Good access. There were black marks all up a wall and paint peeling off the ceiling above the shower and a bunch of lights didn't work, but it served its purpose! Parking was annoying."
382,Jazmin,2023-04-19,"Lovely room, lovely view, dodgy shower. Staff were amazing. Room was bright, beautiful, clean and lovely view of the park. The shower wasn't great. Would just point towards the door even if you tried to move it and got everything wet. Bathroom floor was ice cold."
383,Josh,2023-04-17,Good  provide single beds if possible.
384,Eirwen,2023-04-16,"Great location , friendly staff , bit pricy Friendly staff , great location , comfortable rooms We thought that £9 for two coffees was a bit steep"
385,Simone,2023-04-16,"A pleasant stop over, an ice change to pop to the shopping centre…. Kids loved the waffle machine in the breakfast room we enjoyed luxury of King room and location was great!"
386,Kay,2023-04-15,"Central location - well placed for a city break. Great location and friendly staff throughout hotel, plus an excellent breakfast."
387,Stephen,2023-04-12,"A great place to stay for a short visit. Room was great, slept well. Quiet and comfortable and with a good shower. Compact but good value for the location. Breakfast, included in our room rate, was excellent. Fresh and warm croissants and a good hot breakfast buffet with omelettes cooked to order, waffles and cold buffet items also available, plus decent coffee from a machine. Staff were very attentive, friendly and efficient. The property and the room was really clean which is a plus. No dislikes but mattress was a little hard otherwise everything else was comfortable."
388,Julie,2023-04-12,Great location and friendly staff. The staff were very friendly and the location perfect. Nothing really.
389,Alki,2023-04-11,Great location with good breakfast great location - close to the train and the city centre everything you need good breakfast the outside of the building seems too 'old' / industrial - but very minor. The inside is fine.
390,Jeanette,2023-04-10,highly recommended superb room and facilities not a lot of tv channels
391,Ying,2023-04-10,Will definitely stay with Hilton again 👍🏻 The breakfast was exceptional! Had a fab wake up coffee and made my own waffles. The room is quiet and I slept through the night comfortably. All staffs are very attentive and friendly.
392,Rachael,2023-04-10,"comfortable hotel at a good price and good location super location, helpful staff, smart rooms, brilliant breakfast parking was almost an issue but they sorted it for us"
393,Payal,2023-04-10,Good amazing afternoon and night staff. Rooms are tired looking but comfortable beds. The breakfast staff absolutely amazing work and cooking done well. It is interesting that the charge for breakfast at the hotel is more around £12.00 and booking.com reflects £10.00. The £10.00 should be applied regardless.
394,Martin,2023-04-10,"Superb Location, hair conditioner and other hygiene properties in the bathroom, perfect breakfast Missing toilet brush"
395,Amparo,2023-04-10,"Great hotel. The room was comfy, and all the staff, restaurants, services, etc, too. Everything was almost perfect, but there was one problem. The room door was annoying because it didn't open the door easily. We asked in the reception to change the card door, and they did but still with the same problem."
396,Lloyd,2023-04-10,"The staff were excellent and accomodating. However, our linen had holes in it, which was concerning. As a whole, the hotel is relatively clean and in an easily accessible location. There was a smell of fish when walking from the ground floor to first floor for most of our stay at the hotel."
397,Daniel,2023-04-09,couldn’t get parking space . even though we’d paid for it. we did get a refund . the meal wasn’t value for money. lovely the car parking wasn’t great
398,Katy,2023-04-09,"it was short and sweet, shared a twin room with my daughter who is 19 so space was a little tight! the bathroom was quit was clean throughout the bedroom was small and bathroom! a few bits could do with amending"
399,Lindsey,2023-04-09,"Clean modern and well situated. All good apart from the parking confusion. The location was good. It was a short walk to the river and some of the central spots. Clean and modern room. Friendly staff. Breakfast was a good selection and included in the price. Confusion about the parking. We knew spaces were limited and first-come-first-serve, however my friend arrived first and was reassured that we could park on the yellow hatch marked boxes up against the building if no spaces were available. I arrived and parked in one of those yellow boxes, however when I double checked this at check-in, the staff member I spoke to said this was not allowed due to a recent change of policy. She told me I would have to move the car and gave some poor advice about other local car parks (one of them only allowed 4-hour slots whereas I was staying for 48 hours and the other one required pre-booking and had no availability). I asked why several other cars were parked in the boxes and received a vague answer that they were guests who were checking out, however this was 5.30pm and I also noted that there were at least 2 different cars parked in the yellow boxes at any point during my stay. Ultimately I managed to grab a proper space (quite expensive at £20 per night) but it all made for a frustrating and flustering start to the stay. I should mention that my friend was also told that the disabled bays were fine to use if nothing else was available but I would not have felt comfortable to do that."
400,John,2023-04-09,"thoroughly enjoyable, would stay again room was lovely, clean and spacious, breakfast was very good, location was a bit out of town location a bit out of town"
401,Christopher,2023-04-08,"Good stay Great location, well appointed room which was available early :-) Restaurant was pricey and the shower cubicle ceiling paint was peeling badly."
402,Pal,2023-04-08,"Not bad for a few days in Bristol First of all, let me give a shout-out to the extremely helpful hotel personnel who went out of their way to make our stay problem-free. Thank you. Staying on the positive side, the location of the hotel is great, it is located a few minutes from shopping centres, not too far from nice attractions. And Bristol is a very nice city. The room was small and heating was not adequate, so an electric heater was provided which had a tendency to overheat when we used it full on. During early morning I was able to sit in the bar and work, though the wall sockets did not have power."
403,Jason,2023-04-07,"Excellent Hotel, Amazing Staff The staff were very friendly and courteous and could not do enough for you, from the reception to restaurant to chamber maids, all were amazing. Before we arrived, I asked for an early check-in due to getting to Bristol very early that morning. A note was put on the system. On arrival, no rooms were available, which was very understandable, but we were told to go into the restaurant and grab a coffee or some food while we where waiting , to me, this was a really nice gesture to arriving guests.. Then we were told our room was ready, we were in our room around 11.30/12.00 ... the hotel could do no wrong, the whole hotel is kept very clean and all staff are an absolute credit to the hilton group, If we return to Bristol I know exactly where we will be staying ' The Hilton Garden Inn' Nothing.."
404,Karen,2023-04-07,"Great location, easy to check in and out Staff very friendly and efficient"
405,Nia,2023-04-06,nice hotel great staff and breakfast nice central clean parking on site room was very hot a/c didn’t get very cold.
406,Tamsin,2023-04-04,Good Suited my needs for a single night stay Some very rude and unhelpful staff on the front desk
407,Scott,2023-04-03,Superb We had very friendly service and we really enjoyed the central location which is walking distance to kings street and the nightlife. Booked in advance so the rooms were good value as well. No complaints at all.
408,Tracey,2023-04-02,Perfect for a meet up as just round the corner from the train station It was the chosen and ideal location for a small group of friends to meet up. There was no warm relaxing area of comfy seating
409,Huskypup,2023-03-26,"Excellent hotel, location and facilities. Hotel is located set back from a main road, 8 minutes walk from Temple Meads station. Access can be made from front or rear. Restaurant on ground floor. Lifts to all floors. Spacious double room, with shower room. Cupboard with ironing board and iron. Large flat screen TV opposite large double bed, featuring bedside shelves, lamps, reading lights and sockets. Side table/desk with drawers inc. hairdryer, lamp and office style chair. Folding wall mirror above. Floor to ceiling window with opening pane, view only of a close neighbouring building under construction (as of March 2023). Additional comfortable leatherette chair. Double mirrored wardrobe with hangers and drawers, side cupboard containing fridge and safe. Clean kettle and basic tea & coffee above. Shower room with toilet, shelves, sink, and separate shower cubicle. Various towels and soap dispensers provided. Really not much to fault. The bed creaked and banged every time I moved. Lifts could be heard clearly despite my room being some distance from them. The main ceiling light didn't work. One of the desk drawers was broken."
410,Carolynne,2023-03-26,Superb It is close to town and the station. It has all the facilities that I need. Nothing
411,Ben,2023-03-21,"OK… not bad, not amazing! I’m a bit of a foodie and whilst the cooked breakfast looked good it was only OK.. eggs were under, sausage and bacon were over.. I appreciate it’s a buffet and it’s hard to get right.. the bread I toasted was actually really good!! The bed creaked loudly from any movement.. I looked under and it was made from MDF sections that were loosely bolted together and without correct tools I couldn’t fix it! Wasn’t a deal breaker… Bathroom was tiny and shower was in poor condition, broken door hinge, cracked tray and blistered paint to ceiling.. All clean and functional, would have been upset if I had paid any more!"
412,Caroline,2023-03-21,"Superb Location, staff and good value. A light and airy hotel with comfortable clean rooms."
413,Alice,2023-03-20,"Cheap and clean but rather basic Location and parking. Basic but clean. Air con/heating didn't work, no toiletries, bed uncomfortable. In need of TLC for example mirror and toilet roll holder both loose. Did the job for a cheap hotel."
414,Dougie,2023-03-19,Al in all good good location. good breakfast a few spillage marks on the walls. bathroom very small
415,Gill,2023-03-19,"Very good Staff were excellent, breakfast was very good, bed was very comfortable. Easy parking. Not a lot. Quite a lot of noise at night."

418,Carlos,2023-03-16,"Nice hotel, great location. lovely breakfast and friendly helpful staff. Comfortable room, great location, friendly helpful staff, great breakfast. Room was a little cold to start with despite heating on maximum, bur warmed up later (I presume centrally controlled). On the expensive side for what it is, but that's Bristol for you."
419,Celia,2023-03-16,Very pleasant. Everything we needed. Will probably come again. Room was great - we seemed to get a free upgrade If we were being really fussy I suppose we would like barista coffee at breakfast
420,Tina,2023-03-13,"A great return visit! Great location, excellent breakfast and breakfast staff. Good quality food in the restaurant. Beds/pillows a bit hard. subject to choice!"
421,Linda,2023-03-13,Very good Staff on desk and in the restaurant were very polite and helpful The bottles in bathroom need to be checked and filled up when room is made up and the room wasn't very warm
422,Debbie,2023-03-12,Very good Breakfast was nice & our room was good. Other guests banging around and shouting at 4am
423,John,2023-03-09,"Good  I was on the top floor and unfortunately I could hear the av fans on the roof, kept me awake abit"
424,Neil,2023-03-07,Superb staff friendliness. location.
425,Deborah,2023-03-07,"Good Comfortable and clean room. Nice and friendly receptionists. We drove by car but it was extremely difficult to find the hotel due to road works in the vicinity. A message from the hotel before the day of arrival would have been helpful to advise on the route. When we arrived there was a huge noise coming from the dining room area where people were drinking, and drunk. Perhaps some carpets would help to soften the noise?"
426,Stephanie,2023-03-06,Superb The great location and friendly and helpful staff.
427,Robert,2023-03-06,"Fairly standard hotel of its type, can't complain. Comfortable beds, good bar, easy distance to walk into town We suspected the car park would be full, as it is advertised as first come, first served, so we parked out of town. Glad we did, the car park was full and there's not really anywhere local to it that we could see to find a spot."
428,Jennifer,2023-03-05,"Good if you don’t mind a very small bathroom friendly staff, handy location for what I needed bathrooms are very small. The shower door is a challenge to manage!"
429,Neil,2023-03-01,Very good comfortable

432,Michael,2023-02-26,"it was overpriced, I have stayed at nicer Premier Inns and Travel lodges for less money good location very uncomfortable bed, both nights we struggled to sleep, the room was too hot and the A/C turned off after 5 minutes"
433,Elizabeth,2023-02-25,Perfect for my needs Location Offered early check in on arrival without asking Staff at reception weren’t very familiar with bus options & timetable to airport. Information online but had hoped for a little local knowledge to make best decision to be on time
434,Dave,2023-02-23,Very good Good Location for City Centre and Railway Station
435,Joshua,2023-02-23,"Very good Room and facilities were exceptionally clean and tidy. Bed was very comfortable. Breakfast service was lovely and satisfying. Arrival and departure was smooth and fast. The air temperature control was out-dated, and very loud in the room."
436,Sophie,2023-02-20,"lovely weekend but wouldn’t stay again the location It was advertised in a very luxurious way, promised city views and got scaffolding and boarded up buildings. Said it was soundproof but alas it was not and we could hear people throwing up the alcohol they consumed at 2am. A queen suite which was smaller than our room at home. It was a lovely weekend but I wouldn’t book again."

440,Francesco,2023-02-19,"Decent hotel if on a budget. Noisy room but great breakfast! - breakfast was very good and great variety! one of the best I had in the UK! - not far from city center, location is good. nice garden nearby. - staff was very friendly ! - the room A/C is too noisy and does not really heat much even at max power. - I could not sleep because of the noise from the A/C - bathroom very small - pillows were not very comfortable and felt cheap - room a bit worn out"

444,Brian,2023-02-15,"Great comfort and location Great shower, very comfortable bed (bit squeaky only) at a very good location. Walking distance to the centre and close to the train station with direct bus to the airport (8£). Everything you ask for in an hotel like this"

I get quite chilly and the heating was not working in the room, plus the instructions next to it were for a different style unit"
448,David,2023-02-12,"City stay Great location close to mainline station and short walk to city centre. Large, clean room. The hotel receptionist charged more than the advertised rate for breakfast but this was sorted after a formal email complaint. The heating in the room was not fully operational."
449,Stacey,2023-02-12,"Professional, easy check-in, superb hotel with great breakfast! Breakfast was amazing, the waffle maker was a complete surprise and added bonus! Only downside to the room is would of love to have a bath, but the shower was wonderful anyway"
450,Patricia,2023-02-11,Superb Close to city centre but in a quiet location All good!!
451,Ian,2023-02-11,Good All as expected. Room to park when I arrived but actually getting into the car park was not easy - no signs to direct from main road as no access from main road - have to go around the back roads and through some building works to other buildings.
452,John,2023-02-10,Good Clean and tidy hotel in a good location Access with a car was very difficult with no signage. Dinner choices were quite limited
453,Fiona,2023-02-10,"Convenient and relaxed Breakfast staff very efficient, friendly and the area was always replenished. The toiletries in the room were lovely and it was great to see a new hairdryer. Public areas very clean and lift was spacious. No one came in to make our bed or renew our refreshments on either day of the stay. That would have been good."
454,Gill,2023-02-09,"Lovely stay Clean and comfortable, with amazing staff. Restaurant food was delicious, would definitely recommend. Really tight on the tea/coffee front... Constantly had to go to reception to ask for more. Reception were happy to give, but it would have been so much nicer to have more than 2 coffee sachets and 4 milk."
455,James,2023-02-07,Good fun V good breakfast Prior information regarding city roadworks

458,Daniel,2023-02-04,"okay clean, functional £20 for parking is terrible and opportunities for making even more money, The room was worth what we paid so parking on top was laughable no extra touches and the shower had hand gel instead of shampoo"
459,Margaret,2023-02-03,Relaxing despite the noise Breakfast was great The room was very noisy due to generators or something. I turned the air con off but this noise throbbed all might!! My room was 524
460,Craig,2023-01-31,"Good value Rooms were to a good standard, breakfast and bar area very good Cardio Machines were not working in the gym"
461,Hocks93,2023-01-31,"Pretty good ey Good location, done us well for new year's. Nice bar downstairs and drinking water, friendly staff and a clean environment Nothing besides having to pay to park"
462,Teresa,2023-01-30,"really good service once you arrive. clean and tidy bright, clean and smelt nice location and parking"
463,Joseph,2023-01-29,"Good hotel facilities, rude staff The hotel was what you would expect from a Hilton sunchain. Clean, unspectacular. Good location. Room was a good size and showers were great. I lost my debit card in the week leading up to my stay. Advised by booking.com to update card prior to the stay. The hotel took a payment of about £1 to check the card. I went to check in where we were greated by a member of staff who was somewhat nonplusssed that we were there. In fairness she had checked another couple in just prior. There were other customers at the desk. I was asked for my details. The receptionist, within earshot of my parter and other customers, mentioned that my card was declined earlier in the week, in a tone and demeanour which was not friendly. I explained that I had put a new card on file which the hotel had taken money from. The fact this was said in earshot of others was quite emabarrasing. I checked in. Nipped downstairs shortly after and took a can of soft drink from the fridge in reception. As soon as I took the can out, another member of staff approached me asking if I intended to pay for it. This happened within a split second of me removing said can from the fridge. This leads me to believe that something may have been mentioned re: the declined card, as if I had been profiled. I advised the member of staff that I had intended to pay for this. I put the can in the fridge as I felt embarrased and purchased from the bar instead, from that member of staff, to save any awkwardness in regards to the fridge. I went to reception the next morning having slept on this. A male receptionist was on at this point. I recounted yesterdays issues with him, only to be informed that they always challenge people using the fridge as people assume it is free (it clearly isnt, the price list is visible). He seemed exasperated to even consider dealing with my complaint. There was no apology or anything. I felt as though I was being looked down"
464,Scott,2023-01-27,Superb Friendly and helpful reception staff Nothing
465,Beverley,2023-01-23,"Excellent location near station, friendly staff central location rooms a little cold"
466,Anne,2023-01-22,great location- lovely friendly helpful staff- food was fabulous diversion and road closures
467,Sally,2023-01-20,handy location for bar on the river good location advertised as parking on site but only after booking does it say first come basis. got the last space when I arrived at 4pm for check in
468,Graham,2023-01-07,"very good location and good staff, shame about the room and size. The property is in a very good location, with easy access to the city centre and train station. Views over the gardens are good and the location is perfect for a “car free” visit to Bristol. The entrance and fragrance in the reception area is exceptional and the staff were very friendly. The rooms are simply not big enough for the price being demanded, in addition the mattress was very uncomfortable to sleep on and the bed creaked and cracked with every movement on it (a person who weighs less than 80kg) this made for a very disruptive nights sleep. The in room facilities although adequate do not reflect what I would’ve expected from a Hilton brand hotel. The wash/bathroom is tiny with very little room to move in and the shower again was very small."
469,Danielle,2023-01-06,great value and clean rooms highly recommended staff or manager was so helpful with advise where to visit on our tour of Bristol clean rooms and breakfast was very yummy would highly recommend na
470,Davinia,2023-01-06,"Good The reception staff were lovely and helpful One of the cleaner ladies was really rude and tried to get into my room even though the door had the ""do not disturb"" sign on. She was aggressively trying to break in, and when I did leave my room- she was then rude to me. One time, she didn't even bother to clean it."
471,Mike,2023-01-05,Good Convenience
472,Menglong,2023-01-05,"Good The location was prefect for me as I had come here by train. So it only took me a few minutes to get off the train and reach the hotel. Besides, there is a bus station in front of hotel, which means you can easily get to the city center. Almost everything in the hotel was very good. There was only one thing I didn't like and that was the small size of the room and the small bathroom."
473,Lisa,2022-12-27,"Great stay Friendly staff, nice comfortable rooms"
474,Rob,2022-12-23,Great Reception Staff Good Location Cost
475,Stuart,2022-12-22,Good Nice foyer with friendly and accommodating staff My room was cold but was given a portable heater.
476,Thomas,2022-12-19,"OK but expensive parking (even when empty) and mis-priced breakfast Comfort & location High price parking. High price breakfast, which was increased by £2 over advertised rate, and increased by a further £2 if not pre-booked"
477,Alanah,2022-12-19,"great staff, ambience and value for money really lovely staff and check in experience, friendly bar staff and really nice ambience downstairs, room was basic but nice and clean."
478,Chris,2022-12-18,it served its purpose being close to centre and relatives convenient location ltd parking
479,Patricia,2022-12-17,Superb Staff are always helpful and willing to go the extra mile. The location is convenient - close to the town centre but in a quiet spot.
480,Simon,2022-12-17,"Just a better class of 'basic'. PLUS parking expense! Great location for our stay in Bristol and a very comfortable (and warm thankfully) room. Not much in the way of hotel facilities. The restaurant/bar wasn't somewhere you wanted to spend time. And you pay £16 a night for parking, which isn't made clear in the booking steps. This felt like 'hidden' costs to me. Plus parking, plus breakfast! For a Hilton, it had no luxurious feel to it at all. Just a better class of 'basic'. I wouldn't stay again."
481,Sarah,2022-12-16,good hotel for a night’s stay. the location was perfect. The staff were lovely and the room was comfortable and very clean. the snack we had in the bar was delicious if a little pricey. my room was freezing even after turning up the heat and the aircon fan sounded like a freight train. even after I switched it off it occasionally started up again. a bottle of water and some tissues in the room would have been appreciated.
482,Kathryn,2022-12-12,"would come again location, friendly staff, good breakfast problem with heating, resolved with a heater and extra duvet"
483,Claire,2022-12-11,"Good modern hotel near Temple Meads station The staff were great, so helpful, and helped us to find somewhere to go out for dinner. Room was very modern and comfortable, good bathroom. We had a nice view of the park, and it's super convenient for Temple Meads train station The price was room only and quite high because of that. It's quite a modern hotel, but would be improved by adding some USB charging points, which most modern hotels seem to have these days"
484,Martyn,2022-12-07,"A pleasant stay Staff welcoming, beds comfortable and room not too warm The soap dispenser in the bathroom was empty. There was no water at all on one of the mornings so could not shower/wash before breakfast."
485,Cheryl,2022-12-05,Very good The hotel is nice room was very cramped and too small for two people. Offered up grade by email but was refused on the reception desk on arrival infront of other customers very embarrassed bathroom was tiny had to ho in and shut the door to be able to get to the toilet.. no biscuits in the room and only a couple of milks. Clean and breakfast was good
486,M5l,2022-12-04,Superb Breakfast!
487,Christine,2022-12-03,Very good Clean. Comfortable. Close to train station. Far out from main area.. where most restaurants and pubs are.
488,Sarah-jane,2022-12-01,stayed in many hotels in Bristol it was okay Nice and clean we arrived to be told there was no bar Friday or Saturday evening due to private parties. limited parking too which we weren’t expecting
489,John,2022-11-28,"A comfortable stay in an ideal location. The staff were very helpful, the room was comfortable and the breakfast buffet was very nice. Some of the facilities were a little tired and need of update/replacement. For example, the window catch was broken and the mirror was not properly in its fixture."
490,Jane,2022-11-27,overnight stay to meet family. good location easy walk into centre good location paying for parking
491,Caron,2022-11-27,Very good The man on Reception was very helpful even got me and extra duvet as I was cold Our neighbours had no respect
492,Kerri,2022-11-20,"Superb Everything. Lovely welcome, given extra blankets as get cold and amazing breakfast. Only one thing. Mattress was not that comfortable and very creaky when turning over."
493,Emily,2022-11-19,Very good  the beds were very creaky and the walls very thin - could hear everything next door
494,Bill,2022-11-19,"A one stay and the hotel delivered in all respects. Staff are superb, helpful and freindly Staff were very helpful during and after my stay. I left an item in the room which they found and communicated to me, then returned. Nothing."
495,Lalitkumar,2022-11-18,Ideal Stay hotel located in walking distance from Temple Meads Rail Station. Rooms are well appointed. Twin bedded rooms are bigger then Queen bed rooms. Breakfast is nice and good spread. More Veg dishes would be appreciated in breakfast. Bus no 8 stop is right in front of the hotel to go to Clifton Suspension Bridge and near Cabot Circus Departmental Store. Trains to Cardiff and Bath Spa Town are easily available from Temple Meads Rail Station. Thanks to the Reception staff for sending Birthday Cake for my wife to our Room.
496,Elisabeth,2022-11-16,"Nice, clean hotel. A bit expensive for what you are getting. Room was clean Bed really hard and uncomfortable Not a lot of parking available"
497,Sophie,2022-11-16,"Superb  I had specifically asked for some gin to be delivered on the 2nd night of our stay (as my friend's special anniversary) but sadly they had put it out on the first night so when we arrived it was already sitting there, very nice, but on the wrong day. I told a member of staff at Reception and he said what would he like me to do and I half-heartedly said 'Another would be nice on the actual day of celebration tomorrow night!' He said fine - which was a mistake as it did not appear the next evening. He should not have agreed without asking his supervisor probably. A beautiful hotel so this was a real shame that this happened."
498,Tanya,2022-11-15,Will stay there again. Parking available on site. Large clean room. Nice breakfast. Having to pay for parking on site.
499,Jackie,2022-11-11,"Typical city centre hotel. Close to station. Staff were very good, friendly and helpful throughout, especially as just arrived from Heathrow Garden Hilton, so better in comparison. Breakfast was OK (although surprisingly, not as good as the Heathrow GH). Didn't have dinner but a satisfactory (if expensive) sandwich and the bar was reasonably pleasant. Rooms are a bit small and I didn't find the bed that comfortable (others may have a different experience). The place is looking a bit tired, but not unacceptably so."
500,Ajsidebottom,2022-11-11,Adequate room for overnight stay with comfortable bed. Avaialbility of bar. Breakfast on site. Comfortable room. Close to Temple Meads railway station - 5 minute walk Close to city centre - 10 minute walk Moderately close to university - 20 minute walk Shower room small Breakfast food a little overcooked Requested quiet room but adjacent to main ring road so traffic noise - muffled.
501,Neya,2022-11-10,"Enjoyable return visit to this clean, comfortable, hotel supported by friendly and helpful staff. We have stayed there before. Comfortable good-size room. Good restaurant. Pleasant, helpful staff. Mini fridge in room really useful. Wi-Fi was fairly reliable. Bed was comfortable. Would have liked a bath as well as a shower. A couple of maintenance issues in room. Had to ask twice for more toilet rolls. No shampoo in dispenser. Pillows were a bit soft. Cleaner took the wine glasses we brought, but bar staff happily replaced these. Car park expensive at £16 per day."
502,Kerry,2022-11-03,Very good Staff were great Room was a little small.
503,Christopher,2022-10-31,"Nice, welcoming and generally clean hotel. Rooms are a little outdated. Lobby was clean, glamorous, and smelled lovely, nice and open and very inviting. The room seemed a little outdated with the decor, that had chips, scratches all over it and also loose hair left in the drawers. I felt like the attention to detail when it came to cleaning was somewhat rushed."
504,Nichola,2022-10-30,"Ideal place for music venues and temple meades Central location- for Temple Meades Easy to find Walkable Quiet (from outside noise)- even on the main road side! Bathroom good size Toiletries available Iron and ironing board available Tv actually worked (no TV guide though) Bed size was good (two twins together) Needs sockets on both sides of bed Noise- bathrooms, from neighbouring rooms Pillows too soft- feather (personal preference) Size comparable to price, didn’t feel like a good deal"
505,Veronica,2022-10-29,the proof that great employees will make your stay better the lobby area and the breakfast. But the only thing that made it worth it was the personnel. The girls at the reception were amazing. Super friendly and helpful. The made the difference The bathroon was not clean.
506,Stuart,2022-10-29,Very good close to transport links
507,Katie,2022-10-29,"Very convenient and parking was a bonus. Lovely staff and great location Really convenient location and parking too for £16 for 24 hours, which was great for us. The housekeeping staff were super helpful as I asked for extra cups and towels and nothing was too much trouble for them. The breakfast was very good too. A minor and very minor would be to have more fruit options rather than just melon and pineapple, but everything else was excellent."
508,Georgia,2022-10-28,Friendly staff and comfortable hotel Clean and comfortable and in a central location - staff were really friendly!

514,Coralie,2022-10-18,"Welcoming and comfortable A welcoming and very comfortable hotel - rooms are spotless, comfortable and with great views toward the park (rear). Easiky accessible from Temple Meads. Staff are friendly and responsive. Nothing"
515,Wendy,2022-10-17,"Sort out the car parking - just saying it is very limited is not at all helpful! Very helpful staff, hotel was clean, well maintained and comfortable. Ridiculous system with the car parking - not nearly enough car parking spaces - said first come first served but this caused me considerable distress not knowing whether I could access a car parking space and no idea where else I could park because there was no offer of other information or signage. There was more room in the tiny car park to create more spaces but the owner has not bothered to think about the basic needs of its customers. Put me off staying there. I gave it a good as the female receptionist on duty very kindly allowed me to park in an unused disabled car park which I really appreciated her for her initiative for a system that was not her fault."
516,Robert,2022-10-16,Very good location and cleanliness good choice for breakfast but hot food was cold
517,Sharon,2022-10-16,Smart hotel and good location Smart hotel. Handy location for the train. Breakfast was a little disappointing as there was no brown bread for toast and the poached egg didn't taste nice.
518,Lee,2022-10-16,"Great location , cheap when booking early. would stay again close to city center , parking available at the hotel at rate of £16 a night. staff allowed us to check in early and have rooms next to each other rooms are very simple for a Hilton. lots of little snagging that could have been done. loose toilet handle , black Sicilians seals etc"
519,Sherrie,2022-10-15,"Perfect for our needs but were starving when we went to bed Very clean, friendly staff, good location for where we needed to be Beds too hard, even though the heating / air conditioning was off, it was very noisy and sounded like we were in a wind tunnel throughout the night. No where it get food when we came back at 11.30pm, bar and resteraunt closed and no takeaways near hotel"
520,Abbie,2022-10-15,Shaky start but comfortable stay. Staff very helpful when there was a problem checking in. Room very clean and comfy. The problem checking in!

532,Bianca,2022-10-02,"Good Stayed here a couple of times, no real issues. Great location, on site parking, helping staff and room service with tasty food. Whenever I tried to ring reception or room service no one would answer so I ended up having to go down to order, then my order arrived with missing bits. Also I had to sit in the bar for 45 mins as there was a delay with my check in, they told me I was given a free upgrade to apologise but when I got to my room it was tiny and smaller than the one I had originally booked."

Hotel easy to get to from railway station. All staff excellent - welcoming and keen to help. Every part of hotel very clean. Comfortable furnishings. There are plenty of hotels in central Bristol but I would be happy to stay in this one again. Room good if a little dark. Breakfast OK but somehow lacking a little on flavour - eggs cold. Coffee OK."
536,James,2022-09-30,"Very good Room, staff, service all very good. Access to the hotel car park was very difficult due to ongoing work. Very poor sign posting. It took me 40 minutes and several attempts to get into the car park."

547,Hayley,2022-09-11,"Very good Friendly staff, lovely breakfast. Clean bathroom and bed/bedding. We had 3 rooms booked and reception staff made sure we were in rooms next to each-other without us requesting this. Close to the city centre. Skirting boards and behind beds very dusty, could do with pulling beds out to clean behind."
548,Zoe,2022-09-11,Lovely & comfortable would definitely stay again I stayed for one night the rooms where lovely & clean bigger enough for two people it had tea/coffee facilities plus hairdryer all the stuff was lovely evening food was a bit pricey but as for breakfast £14 for whatever you could eat and drink which I think is really good How noisy the doors are when they’re closing they close with quite a Big Bang

554,Graham,2022-09-06,"Nice and comfortable, with some outstanding service We were looking for the hotel by car at about 6 pm on Saturday night. We could not find it. We rang the hotel, and the receptionist on duty was brilliant at guiding us in by phone and then helping us in the car park. Arrangements for breakfast could have been managed a bit better. For example, I asked for honey. The member of staff returned with two large boxes of the stuff, suggesting it was meant to be on offer but was not. No-one checked me in on either breakfast that I attended. I could have walked in off the street."
555,Stephen,2022-09-05,business trip nice hotel in good location breakfast was not very good and cold and very expensive

Room info was non existent and our room wasn’t made up after our first night but this didn’t affet our enjoyment. The Coffee mugs in the room are too small."
558,Millward,2022-09-03,"Very good if you’re a solo traveler and are only staying in Bristol for a few nights or if you only need a hotel for sle It’s a 5 min walk from Temple Meads station and my room had a nice view of the park. My bed was very comfy also. My door was very dodgy. I couldn’t close it properly unless I properly slammed it shut. One night I was worried I couldn’t get into my room because it just wasn’t opening. The bolt just wouldn’t loosen for the door to open. Luckily it did in the end, but I think the bolt needs fixing."
559,Mónica,2022-08-30,"Very good The location it's great close to Bristol Temple Meads and just short distance to city centre. Good size room. The air con was a bit noise even when not working and was difficult to control and because I was on 5th floor I could hear a constant machine noise that I was not sure was coming from. I would suggest putting a bottle of water in the rooms as well apart from coffee, tea and sugar bags."
560,Richard,2022-08-30,Good Close to railway station

Nothing wrong with the property just one small thing : There was a mix up on the booking days , not sure how it happened"
574,Andrea,2022-08-10,"Very pleasant and relaxing. The breakfast was excellent, good variety too. The staff made it for us, efficient,and very helpful and thoughtful. Everywhere very clean. Quiet too. Car parking could have been better."
575,Micah,2022-08-08,"Ok hotel, don’t expect real Hilton quality. The location was good. It is an ok hotel. Does not live up to the name Hilton. The corridors and other hotel facilities seemed to lack care over the years."
576,Tracey,2022-08-08,Friendly staff and good value Room was comfortable Breakfast not that great
577,Heather,2022-08-08,lovely clean and roomy no bath
578,Peter,2022-08-07,decent hotel friendly staff and good location very clean we’ll located and staff friendly and helpful shower excellent No shower gel parking charges and also car hit covered in sap from tree and had to be cleaned
579,Joshua,2022-08-07,"Great, would come back Great and affordable breakfast Nothing"
580,Thomas,2022-08-06,Good useful location and tea making facilities in bedroom. my room was next to lift shaft so very noisy all night. breakfast was fairly good.
581,Elizabeth,2022-08-04,An enjoyable stay with helpful staff Staff very helpful. The cost of parking. Would have preferred a bigger room
582,Christopher,2022-08-04,"Forget about the breakfast. I would stay here again The hotel is very well located to the city. Being on the main road the room was very quite and had a wonderful sleep, Infact, it was so quite I often over slept. The staff on the front desk we good to chat with but the staff within the breakfast area, well, let not say anything yet Let's take Breakfast. I didn't book breakfast for not sure what hours I'd be working but the rate that Booking.com told me I'd pay on the day was different from what they were going to charge me. Between the hotel and booking.com they got it sorted. Always print things off. The staff in the breakfast area never made contact. Not even a good morning. They were very quick at clearing the tables even if you had food on your plate and gone to get another coffee. When I returned my table and food had been cleared. They were just not interested in the job."
583,Allison,2022-08-03,"Superb Great location, lovely staff. Has a lovely feel with the gardens along side. Nothing we didn't like."
584,Graham,2022-08-01,Superb The room was lovely. Breakfast was very good. Found the beds hard. The TV remote was missing did report to reception on departure.
585,Eva,2022-08-01,"Good Location I didn't like that we were placed in a room by the entrance to the floor, it was very laud, room was for wheelchair users, no shower gel in the room. No bin liners"
586,Bottomley,2022-07-31,"Overall happy with the price for the service. Clean and appealing rooms, informative staff, parking on site, location was great. Parking £16 a night, electric charging in the car park did not work, room was rather warm and AC was very slow."
587,Keith,2022-07-31,Good good location and helpful staff and on site parking a bit dated room interiors but very clean
588,Peter,2022-07-29,"A very enjoyable, relaxing break. Hotel was very nice and our room lovely and bright and comfortable, location was excellent for access to all the main areas of Bristol. Breakfast was very good, and the staff delightful. Maybe the view."
589,Mojisola,2022-07-28,Superb The male receptionist was very friendly and acted in a professional manner. Answered all questions in a friendly manner. I give him 10/10. The staff in the morning was pleasant also. The sausage and bacon at breakfast was quite dry otherwise breakfast was OK
590,Scott,2022-07-27,Nice overnight stay Clean and modern
591,Paul,2022-07-25,"Very good Staff, location Original room hadn't been cleaned but upgraded to park view which was nice"
592,Alex,2022-07-24,"Great value and perfect location Location was excellent. Room was warm, comfortable, and well maintained. There was a wobbly toilet roll holder, but that's nothing dramatic. Nothing wrong whatsoever. I enjoyed my stay."
593,David,2022-07-24,Good Friendly and helpful staff Overpriced for what you get
594,Nahid,2022-07-23,lovely central location excellent location for travel connections. clean rooms. lovely toiletries. staff super helpful a bit pricey
595,Khalifa,2022-07-22,"Excellent staff and good location. The reception staff were excellent, especially the Night Shift staff who were very helpful and friendly. nothing"
596,Brian,2022-07-21,The reception staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. clean and quiet. location isn't great.
597,Sally,2022-07-20,"Comfortable, convenient stay. Would definitely stay again It was great to have a twin room option. The beds were really comfortable. Air conditioning was great. Breakfast was lovely with good choices. Staff were responsive to our queries. Ideally located for the main Bristol train station. Lots of storage Bar shut at 11pm. We would have liked a drink when we got back but it shut at 11pm and we didn't see a lot nearby apart from a Wetherspoons. The room was very small but it was fine for us for just one night."
598,Elizabeth,2022-07-20,Superb Location was good although a lot of building going on in the area so glad we didn't have a car. Room was lovely.
599,Maria,2022-07-20,Good The room was very bright and nicely structured They need to do some work to become more customer centric.
600,David,2022-07-19,All we could hope for VERY welll set out shower room but comfortable chairs a bit awkward to use without blocking someting in the space available.. Outlook over adjacent garden and resding in it a HUGE bonus. The meal we enjoyed was conventional but could not be faulted and first rate staff throughout Not much given the site but did not see a 'lounge' area we would have appreciated at other times of year. But did not ssk and may well have one.
601,Nick,2022-07-19,Very good Good location. Good breakfast. Good air con. Friendly staff.
602,Joanna,2022-07-19,all the staff were very courteous and obliging. very clean and lovely staff. it was great
603,Elizabeth,2022-07-18,"Super night away Bar, reception and breakfast staff were outstanding"
604,John,2022-07-18,"Very relaxing stay within easy walk of town centre. We were on the 5th floor. Even though the room was an the ""road"" side (i.e. not garden view), it was very quiet. This was the weekend of the boat festival - it was actually quite nice NOT to be in the centre of the action - but close enough to walk without problems. The aircon worked well and kept the room cool even when very hot outside. Very comfy pillows. Didn't try the restaurant. Staff helpful - in the absence of a concierge service, the desk staff were able to advise on a good bakery, and an easy way to get to Cathedral Walk. I still think the price was a tad high; we chose it because everywhere else anywhere near the centre was equally expensive - could have gone out of town, but then would have incurred taxi fares."
605,Rachel,2022-07-18,"Great location with good views and easy walking access to train and bus stations Outstanding location - easy walk from Bristol Temple Meads (easier from the rear exit of the station). Garden facing rooms overlook the Temple avenue of trees, which are very tall and beautiful. Hart's bakery, at the train station, is an easy walk for excellent coffee and pastries. We had breakfast in the churchyard opposite the hotel, on a bench beneat the trees. It was wonderful. Big windows but only one of them opened (and barely at that), and air conditioning that is not as powerful as it needs to be when windows don't open. No hotel stationery (paper or pens). Good selection of teas and coffees, including decaffineated options."
606,Hilary,2022-07-17,"functional…. staff were very good, helpful, friendly and efficient central room could have been cleaner, water marks on doors and walls from old water leaks?"
607,Nia,2022-07-17,"Great place to stay, close to the hippodrome. Very clean and had excellent facilities in the room. Staff were very helpful. The mattress was very hard and parking was ok but limited spaces and expensive."
608,Michael,2022-07-15,"Good staff were friendly at reception and the air con in the room was spot on during this heatwave curtains and walls were dirty and marked but nothing too major , double bed was 2 singles pushed together"
609,Jane,2022-07-15,"Pleasant stay, comfortable room, hotel staff were really nice I’d asked for a quiet room and was allocated one that was super quiet. The staff were very pleasant and attentive. The room air temperature was just right. The breakfast was good. The beds were comfortable. The only slight drawback about its otherwise good location is that there aren’t any cafes or restaurants really nearby."
610,Andrew,2022-07-14,"Great - would happily stay there again. Friendly and professional staff. Efficient service. Quick checkout. Room small but well appointed with plenty of storage and a in ironing board and a clean iron (ie not covered in burnt-on residue); an iron and board is so often missing in modern hotels. Great location close to amenities and train station. Cost a little more than I would have wished, but was competitive in the area. My stay was so short that I can't really think of anything that I didn't like other than the bar being shut when I arrived - although a self-service option was available in the foyer."
611,Robert,2022-07-11,Good work stay good location good food & drink clean and modern accessibility to parking
612,Brimmy,2022-07-11,Very good Clean and standard rooms. Good customer service in a fantastic location close to Temple meads Station and Bristol city centre. A good all rounder Nothing
613,Victoria,2022-07-10,"Despite the negatives, I enjoyed my short stay and would recommend. Location was good, within walking distance to the train station and local attractions. Room was perfect size. Staff were welcoming and friendly at all times. I went out into the local area for the morning and came back to a freshly made bed and everything had been restocked in the room. I felt like I was on Four in a Bed doing the room inspections, haha! The room I stayed in had dust lying around (on bed headboard, bedroom sides, areas in the shower room). The shower room was a bit small but that could just be my personal preference. The shower head was dripping despite being turned off. One of the clean hand towels had dirt on. The main light didn't work and neither did one of the plug sockets."
614,Shelly,2022-07-10,nice stay nice hotel with a modern feel very confusing to get to- the postcode takes you to the front of the building on a duel carriage way and a confusing one way system that you can’t turn down hence you can’t access the Hotel with the postcode
615,Stephen,2022-07-08,"The noisy extractor fan making sleeping difficult would make me reluctant to return Excellent breakfast. The staff were very good. Noisy extractor fan, not the air-conditioning, which was impossible to turn off which was annoying at night."
616,David,2022-07-08,Very good Good breakfast
617,Philip,2022-07-07,"Great hotel in good location A quality hotel which met our expectations. Staff were friendly and efficient, location was just what we wanted and facilities were good. Very happy with it. Car parking at £16 was a quite expensive. Otherwise, it was all good."
618,Rouse,2022-07-07,"pleasant stay, pleasant and helpful staff. central location, clean, comfortable, helpful staff. well equipped and pleasant room, good breakfast. slightly busy location but not noisy on the park side of the hotel."
619,Judy,2022-07-06,Superb Reception staff are exceptionally good - nothing is too much trouble. Nothing
620,Emily,2022-07-05,"Very good staff were amazing, so lovely and helpful"
621,Dearbhla,2022-07-05,Very good location
622,John,2022-07-05,"Now that I know how to access the car park, this is a great place to stay. Very comfortable hotel situated in exactly the right place for our requirements. Finding and getting into the car park was a nightmare. Our satnav took us almost to the hotel but then I had to ask directions. I followed those and as I drove I could see the front of the hotel but with no apparent access for a car. I eventually parked and went into a Novotel hotel to ask for directions. Although the staff were helpful they were unable to give me exact directions. So, I walked around the block to the Hilton Garden Inn where the receptionist explained that I had to drive through an archway, which was clearly marked 'Novotel Hotel', and follow the road to the rear of the Garden Inn Hotel. Quite ridiculous! I could find no mention of this when I re-read everything on my confirmation email. Surely something as fundamental as this should be stated prominently on both booking.com and the hotel website? Also, the hotel charges £16 per day for parking. I don't remember reading that on the website. For any potential guests who might read this review, you should be aware that there are a few spaces in the lane behind the hotel (200 yards from the rear entrance to the hotel) where parking costs are about £5 a day. Not exactly secure but if, like me you object to rip-off parking then this might be an option."
623,Simon,2022-07-01,"Nice stay, nice location. Location close to the Temple Mead railway station. Breakfast choice was very good and the staff were very professional A view of concrete block of an old multi-storey car park from my hotel room window."
624,Elizabeth,2022-06-30,"The staff is very gracious and helpful and the breakfast was a good deal and plentiful. The hotel is very conveniently located to the train station, the harbor area and the Cabot Circus shopping area; all within walking distance and a bus stop for the number 8 bus is right outside and goes around the main harbor area and up to Clifton Park and the zoo. This hotel is more convenient to the train station than most but it’s a nice walk along the canal to the harbor and the M Shed area. The room was a bit of a disappointment because it needs a refurb as of May 2022 and the bed was torture but the bathroom looks like it has been redone recently enough to be clean and well equipped and the nicest part is all the shelf space in the bathroom which is rare these days."
625,Alan,2022-06-29,"Great room, great location and great views Great room, great location nothing"
626,Nicholas,2022-06-27,"convenient for city centre but beware of a tired interior and rowdy stag/hen parties also convenient for city centre the property requires updating as the interior is very tired and looked shabby also the majority of the guests seemed to be on stag and hen parties bringing a different feel to the hotel, also I resented paying for parking"
627,Laura,2022-06-27,"Alex is an asset to the Hilton, amazing customer service The location was brilliant, comfy beds, nice breakfast and overall a really lovely hotel At first we were given a room that wasn’t cleaned, this was soon rectified so no harm done"
628,Becky,2022-06-27,"Good location, comfy bed, friendly staff The room was lovely with comfy bed. I liked having a fridge in the room We went to the restaurant for dinner but found the menu very limited so we actually left and found somewhere else to eat. The shower was also difficult to set as no idea what dial did what"
629,Nikita,2022-06-27,Very good The location was great The rooms were pretty small for the money and the breakfast wasn't great . Nothing was ready and was a 20 min wait for anything to be available
630,Marc,2022-06-26,Very good Clean Parking and trying to get to car park
631,Darrell,2022-06-26,"Comfortable, lovely staff Breakfast was excellent, lots of choice, well presented and beautifully cooked. Cost of parking was a little high at £16 per night."
632,Andy,2022-06-25,overnight stay to visit harbour side Clean nothing
633,Amber,2022-06-25,perfect stay for one night in Bristol it was very central and lovely breakfast the shower was quite difficult to get into
634,Ryan,2022-06-25,fair price good room good food clean and good food bar shut too early
635,Samantha,2022-06-24,"Clean, modern, comfortable and very friendly staff. The breakfast spread was fantastic. Less noisy aircon in the bedroom"
636,Simon,2022-06-24,"Fairly enjoyable Nice central location. Clean, modern hotel. The car park was too small for the size of the hotel. I had to park in another car park a 10 minute walk from the hotel and very expensive."
637,Ze\'ev,2022-06-23,It was an enjoyable stay. The breakfast was very good as was the location. All good.
638,Lauren,2022-06-22,"As expected with lovely staff Staff were great, breakfast was good, design and rooms were great. Loud air conditioning unit, bed quiet hard."
639,Stuart,2022-06-22,Lovely Bed was really comfortable Nothing
640,Luci,2022-06-21,"Really lovely staff and food; convenient location. Would stay again. The staff were lovely and helpful; food in the restaurant was great. Aircon very efficient! We had 2 single beds - I thought they could have done with mattress toppers or similar, as the mattresses were a little hard."
641,Tracey,2022-06-18,Very good Nice rooms Good selection of items at breakfast
642,Shelly,2022-06-16,"Nice location, great breakfast, hard bed. Staff greeted us warmly. They were helpful when we couldn't flag down our bus. Breakfast was very good. The room was nice and clean. We were close enough to the train station to travel about. The beds were very hard. Firm is good, but these needed some give. It was like sleeping on a board. Comfortable beds should be a high priority."
643,Robert,2022-06-15,nice stay in central Bristol hotel good central location modern hotel clean and well kept getting to the car park- various one way roads & restricted access breakfast was ok with limited options
644,Robert,2022-06-14,"Suited all our requirements plus very helpful staff regarding our concerns as we are both deaf . Good choice of Hot water for tea, not clear instructions"
645,Patricia,2022-06-14,It was very good I booked a twin room but had to wait as one wasn't ready so in the end they gave me an upgraded twin room without any extra charge which I was happy with. The location of the hotel was difficult to find as there are many contruction works surrounding it which made it less visible. The breakfast was very good. Nothing.
646,Adam,2022-06-13,"Good Large, very clean room. Very convenient for thr train station, and not that far from the city centre An uncomfortable bed, very hard base and very unsupportive pillows"
647,Gary,2022-06-10,Very good Location to town centre Breakfast layout Check in and out Room was at front of hotel by very busy road. Did not affect my stay generally but someone who requires a quieter location may prefer the rear of hotel
648,Eleanor,2022-06-08,"We had a nice stay in a comfortable hotel with very pleasant staff. Staff were all excellent - really efficient, friendly and welcoming. Room was very clean. Breakfast was excellent. Evening meal and drinks were overpriced. We had to have the windows closed due to the noise of passing traffic."
649,Jenny,2022-06-07,"Good value, pleasant stay. Pleasant, efficient staff; clean room; good location; excellent breakfast. The coldbox thing that masqueraded as a fridge in te room. Very strange."
650,Rhiannon,2022-06-07,"Great location, clean room. clean, good location, good sized room. I felt that the hotel was a little overpriced. We also had to wait longer than 3pm to check in which wasn't ideal."
651,Susan,2022-06-07,Very enjoyable mini bresk Breakfast was great Staff were really friendly and accommodating We had a great time
652,Beatrice,2022-06-07,Good Location very good View from the window. Pillows not to good. English breakfast could be hotter
653,Nathan,2022-06-06,"ideal location good location to bars and restaurants, nice seating area outside bed was uncomfortable for myself (to hard) although partner prefers it that way, sat nav takes you to front of the property where there is no left turn, bit of a nightmare finding the entrance and not very big car park, also charge for the stay"
654,Angelina,2022-06-06,"Perfect hotel for our short stay, good location and comfortable rooms! Really lovely staff, lovely and spacious rooms and comfy bed! Building work outside our window at the time, which cant be helped. Overall good stay!"

658,Vicky,2022-06-03,good overnight location for onward travel location was good finding how to get into the property
659,Katie,2022-06-03,"it was good for the price and good location, just need better pillows lots of storage space in room, good distance from train station and town centre and good mirrors and seating in the room. the pillows were too much, your head would sink into the pillow and cause alot of neck pain."
660,Joanne,2022-06-01,"convenient for city center great location , only a few minutes from the city center. break fast was excellent value ! nothing"
661,Pauline,2022-05-31,Great location. Great location near to train station. Breakfast disappointing. Bacon not cooked well. Breakfast disappointing
662,Skippy33,2022-05-30,Great stay The room and view was lovely and the lady on reception was very welcoming. There was a little bit of lipstick on one of the glasses in the room.
663,Caroline,2022-05-30,"enjoyable room, location, it was a little noisy at night time."
664,Timolene,2022-05-30,suggest restaurant serves lighter breakfasts on request like a roll with ham and cheese snd coffee for say £6 as an al staff very helpful with advice and directions. excellent room interior. great design of cupboards etc. bed very comfortable. tv worked well. Tea coffee making good. mirror above dressing table was too high. thought price very very high for type of hotel. i would have expected £80 per night. nonetheless I really enjoyed my stay.
665,Ole,2022-05-29,"Wonderfull hotel, we hope to come back soon! A small and clean room with a queen szized bed with a quite comfortable mattress. It was very quiet due to the fact that we had a room next to the street. The bathroom had some good amanities and was also very clean. The breakfast was a typical english breakfast, the staff was very nice. We didn´t booked a breakfast option in advance but that was not a problem. The hotel is located near the center of the town, just a 10 minute walk away. The next station Temple meads is also nearby. In conclusion a nice located hotel, we enjoyed our stax. We hope to come back soon! Overall we had a wonderfull experience at the Hilton Garden Inn so it is quite difficult to find something that was wrong or could be done better. The only thing we recognized was the lacking of fresh salad, but thats what not to expect for a typical english breakfast ;-)"
666,Elena,2022-05-29,Very good Breakfast was superb. washing machine and dryer are by 24/7 available and working super fine. staff was always very helpful and in general very nice and caring.
667,Mjc1875,2022-05-28,"Good The location, staff and breakfast Small, creaking bed, noisy air conditioning"
668,Adam,2022-05-26,"Overall - the room was exactly what I needed and the staff were very friendly. No issues at all. Woman who checked me in was very nice, very accommodating, and found me an available room to check into at 11am, despite check in technically being at 3pm. That was great. She also helped with getting the 2nd room key to my friend who was arriving later. She gave me all the necessary details around breakfast etc, Difficult to say the price was great. I originally booked for just myself which was £140 for just me for one night. I then swapped to 2 single beds so my friend could join & the price stayed the same, and I saved money by splitting the cost. Ideally single people shouldn't be penalised for not having a partner, and booking for just 1 person should be cheaper than booking for 2."
669,Ac,2022-05-22,"Very good Good for the price, quiet area, park view ,Not extremely clean, it was definitely not vacuumed before our stay. The mattress was not the best."
670,Brady,2022-05-21,Loved Bristol but the price of £364 for two people for two nights + breakfasts was in my opponion Excellent good variety pleasant and helpful staff The room was addicate but the bathroom was too small we would have liked two chairs and more room to move carefully
671,Mark,2022-05-20,"Convenient location and great staff Good location, fairly central and very convenient. Good Hilton Garden standard with the staff being particularly welcoming and helpful. Parking quite expensive, limited bar, lobby areas. Bathroom a little small and not perfectly clean"
672,Tommy,2022-05-20,Good overall Good location Small bathroom
673,Margaret,2022-05-19,Good location for us and the staff were very helpful. Excellent breakfast with lots of choices. Only negative for me was good location and parking on site was available the bed was very firm
674,Chris,2022-05-18,Ok Great choice at breakfast. Beds were too firm and room was average for £100 p/n
675,James,2022-05-17,"Excellent stay Lovely, spacious room. Very clean and welcoming. Excellent location, very near Bristol Temple Meads and city centre. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room came with all amenities expected."
676,Betteley,2022-05-17,Very close to everywhere we wanted to go Had none
677,Kimberley,2022-05-16,lovely weekend in Bristol not far from the train station
678,Peter,2022-05-15,"Will definitely go again, but only if a proper disabled room with twin beds is available Very clear (and necessary) directions given to the hotel and the adjoining car park. Superb location for easy walking access to the city centre and docks. Excellent wheelchair access for my wife's wheelchair. The staff at reception and in the restaurant were so helpful, above and beyond expectations. Good atmosphere with the staff. Given thorough instructions for disabled exit in the event of an emergency. Lobby, waiting area, restaurant all on one ground floor level. Beds were very good, we both slept really well, much better than at home. Plenty of eating places to suit all tastes within 10 mins walk of the hotel. We needed twin beds due to my wife's disability. The only disabled rooms with twin beds were not full spec for disabled, so the room was too narrow, and no seat in the shower and insufficient handholds. The full spec disabled rooms only had double beds. I spoke to the manager, who was so helpful, efficient and friendly in all matters, who said he would recommend to your GM to adapt one of these rooms for twin beds. No biscuits in the room! Food in the restaurant was good but not excellent. The scrambled eggs were outstanding one morning and quite awful on the next day. Coffee machine troublesome.."
679,Alice,2022-05-13,Perfect location and comfy The bed was really comfortable. It is a great location for both the city centre and the train station. The shower was nice but rather small. The curtains were not black out and I'm a rather light sleeper. The duvet was too heavy for the time of year.
680,Db,2022-05-12,"Excellent stay, will stay again. great location, very good facilities. The staff are very helpful. Clean and great comfort. The bathroom was a bit small, could have been a bit bigger. Otherwise all are ok."
681,Andre,2022-05-12,"Great location friendly staff good breakfast. Great location for local bars and restaurants and only a short walk along the river to the marina area. Good friendly staff, unusual for a hotel chain these days ! Great to have car parking in the centre of the City although it was quite expensive (£16). £16 parking."
682,Susan,2022-05-11,Very good Room and breakfast
683,Sarah,2022-05-10,Very good Room was very comfortable. Good facilities. Good location Cleaning staff very noisy in surrounding rooms. Chatting on phone directly outside.
684,Yetunde,2022-05-09,Good location was not bad breakfast choices were limited no bottes of water for guests
685,Sue,2022-05-05,"Good Comfortable bed, nice hot shower. Good breakfast Room was a bit cramped"
686,Katherine,2022-05-04,staff always lovely close to station The rooms need coat hooks. plug sockets above bedside shelf not below
687,John,2022-05-04,"Bristol getaway. Excellent breakfast. The room was basic,but clean."
688,Clive,2022-05-04,"Good value and quality business or city centre accommodation. My room was at the back of the hotel making it a quiet without any disturbances in the night. Access to hotel car park challenging due to the road works, with all but one access street closed."
689,Stewart,2022-05-03,"Surprisingly quiet hotel near the centre My room at the back of the hotel was very quiet with a nice open, green, view - unexpected for the centre of town. Staff were very friendly and the room was faultless if generic. It was a good experience marred only by the absence of camomille tea in the room-set. It would be nice to see at least one non-stimulant tea."
690,Maria,2022-05-03,Convenient and comfortable The room was clean and the hotel in a good location for Temple Meads Station Would have expected some water in the room and perhaps a mini bar. No option to have breakfast in room or order a paper.

700,Correy,2022-04-29,"Perfect stay would return again and again Second stay within this hotel this year. I’d return again and again when coming to Bristol. Good location short Uber to everything you need. Rooms are all very modern and both stays we’ve had no complaints with either room both different to eachother. All very clean. Nice area downstairs where you can eat ; drink or just grab a small snack. All staff friendly throughout the stay. Gym downstairs which I didn’t go in but had a peek and it seems alright. Highly recommend Room had a view of a scary looking abandoned car park which was a little unsettling but just kept the curtain closed , didn’t expect much of a view in Bristol city centre anyway"

704,Annabelle,2022-04-27,"Very lovely. Breakfast was lovely, staff were kind and helpful. During the fire evacuation, staff were calm and guided everyone very well.

705,Derek,2022-04-26,"Close to Temple Meads station, but a bit far from the centre. Noisy restaurant. Comfortable bed - firm mattress, firm pillows. Effective air conditioning. Nice view over garden. Better lighting - not easy to read unless in bed. TV was badly set up - I corrected it."

Lovely and friendly staff members who was working very hard at the hotel. I say a big thank you to all the lovely staff members :) The room was clean and tidy. Thank you so much for the staff members to work hard for this. Sadly the room was cold at night, but we didn’t want to turn the heating on because of it made too much noise. We didn’t have a good sleep. So to make up, we looked forward for the breakfast in the morning(stayed in Hilton in Japan and I thought it was going to be great)but unfortunately, the breakfast quality was poor and we didn’t enjoy."

Staff are always lovely and friendly, plus they are happy to chat. Rooms are starting to need an update - for example no USB ports in sockets for charging devices. Lighting in this particular room (333) seemed to have a mind of it's own - would sometimes work and other times would randomly come on 5-10 mins after the switch was activated."
743,Maria,2022-03-22,Very good very confortable and cozy. great location bathroom quite small specially the shower

The fridge was switched off and was empty. The TV connection was poor so it was unwatchable and I couldn’t cast to the TV from my mobile as an alternative.
747,Biddyandbuster,2022-03-19,"One of the best chain hotels I have stayed in for room facilities, and cleanliness. There was a warm and genuine welcome from Bailey at reception, and we given all the info we needed on breakfast / dining and checkout etc. Reception was filled with the most wonderful fragrance too. The room was immaculately clean, very well laid out with plenty of storage. Having a fridge was a real benefit for milk and cold drinks. Although compact the bathroom had a good sized shower. I was delighted to see that there was magnifying mirror installed, and the heated mirror was a great feature. Breakfast was good and plentiful, but the evening meal was ok but nothing special. Staff throughout were lovely. The only thing that would prevent me from staying again is the fact that the bed was very uncomfortable for me. Too hard and very creaky. It is shame really as everything else was perfect."
748,Tuane,2022-03-13,"Really good. Very welcoming staff throughout the stay. Friendly staff, comfortable room, good location For a twin room, it would be nice to have two sets of toiletries."

752,Abbie,2022-03-06,"Very good Great location, lovely helpful and kind staff. The room was very quiet considering it overlooked the main road. Lovely hot shower and plenty of space in the room to move about. Loved everything bar the bed. It was abit clunky sounding when you were getting on and off the bed and would of liked it to have been abit softer."
753,Kerry,2022-03-06,"Great hotel for a stopover Modern, spotlessly clean. Professional, courteous staff, comfortable bed. Great value for money. Breakfast an absolute bargain at £9.95 Nothing"

763,Rosalind,2022-02-11,"Our second stay here, and we'll certainly come again. All the staff were really pleasant and helpful. Both breakfast and dinner were good and the dining-room spacious and comfortable. The quick checkout system made our departure easy. The location is great too. The twin room would be more comfortable with an extra chair.; one for each guest. The approach to the hotel was difficult because of building works along Temple Way and it's hard to find the entry to the car-park"
764,Maddy,2022-02-09,"Very good Staff very helpful and welcoming Room was quite small , particularly the bathroom"
765,Laura,2022-02-08,"Very good The location was ideal. The room was clean and large. The bathroom was tidy and clean. The heated mirror in the bathroom was handy. The availability of parking.

769,Becky,2022-02-05,"Lovely place for a short stay it was really close to the train station and bus routes to get into town, or if you wanted to walk that was doable as well. It was on a main road but you couldn’t tell because it wasn’t noisy at all Nothing I can think of - everything was good"
770,Mark,2022-02-02,"Superb Great staff, great breakfast and perfect location for train arrivals and departures"
771,Anna,2022-01-31,"Good The staff at the reception were very welcoming and nice. It wasn't a best stay, room didn't had much light. Food facilities were poor specially late at night. I would of expected a better experience specially as its hilton."

We ordered room service one night and the staff were really friendly. We enjoyed breakfast very much and found the staff really friendly and helpful, especially one guy who was lovely. Unfortunately I didn't see his name but he helped me find the fruit juice! All in all, we had a lovely stay and would recommend the hotel to friends/family when visiting Bristol."

779,Jason,2022-01-27,Superb The very friendly gentleman on reception allowed me to check in very early as my room was available. Getting into my room early after a 0630 flight was most welcome & greatly appreciated. It’s location close to the train station.

781,Karen,2022-01-27,"Good visit Friendly helpful staff. Great location Booked through Booking.con and I wasn’t able to amend and remove breakfast from the booking. Also, ordered room service and the food was poor quality and certainly not value for money"

Hot buffet choice was good with quality ingredients but food was totally cold even freshly cooked sausages & beans chef bought out were still cold! Tomatoes & mushrooms were cold, dried up & hard. Very disappointed & never had to complain before about a hotel breakfast but just could not eat it. A refund was handled very well with member of staff on reception. I'm certain this experience was an exception to normal sevice & would not put us off staying again."

I gauge a hotel on ""would I stay here for a weekend getaway with the misses?"" Answer ""Yes!"" but I wouldn't take her here if it was our honeymoon... The Hotel is well presented. Plenty of car parking spaces. Easy access to the city of Bristol. The room was clean and spacious and well laid out. The Breakfast was plentiful in choices.

801,Roy,2021-12-27,"Great people. Staff were great. Facilities very nice. Breakfast very ordinary and good very overpriced in my view, paid £16.95 for little more than mini fish and chips.

The room was on the small side but had a lovely view over the park. Good location for the Christmas market and Carbot Circus - about a 10 minute walk The room was small so a means to hang up coats on the way in would be useful as the wardrobe was difficult to access as it was close to the bed,"
820,Neil,2021-12-06,"A good trip Central location, clean and comfortable"
821,Christina,2021-12-06,"busy vibrant city, hotel in good location Very good value for money, very quiet room, really helpful staff Difficult to find due to construction works in city centre and road closures"
822,Valerie,2021-12-06,"The hotel made our visit to Bristol very enjoyable. Would definitely stay here again. Bed very comfortable. Room not noisy at all during the night which was good as it overlooked the busy main road. Great to have a fridge & hairdryer in room. Breakfast was enjoyable, plenty of choice Location good for city centre Checking in/out process very swift. Peter on Reception went out to buy a paper for my partner on Saturday morning, much appreciated. Thanks to him. Nothing I didn't like, all very good. thank you"
823,Sharon,2021-12-06,"Very good Hotel was clean rooms were lovely bed really comfortable, staff friendly Bit of cheek to charge as much as they do to park car in their own car park ,then difficulty trying to reverse out , when people are allowed to park along wall where there's no parking bays ,"
824,Jill,2021-12-05,mini break in excellent hotel within walking distance of main attractions. location and staff breakfast could have been hittr
825,Connie,2021-12-05,"great trip away for a few nights! the reception staff were great, and the location was ideal! it’s a shame you have to pay separately to park there! the bed was very creaky too"
826,Stephen,2021-12-05,"Lovely clean room, lovely breakfast Clean comfy room. Lovely breakfast"
827,Michael,2021-12-05,"ok Everything basically OK Because of road works at time of visit, hotel hard to get into. Although staff were helpful & friendly, lack of staff at times made waiting a little annoying."
828,Karen,2021-12-03,"Very good Ideal location and not far from train station. Nice hotel, good value."
829,Jones,2021-12-01,"Very good Location was good had a few issues with staff and coffee regarding breakfast. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Room wasn't refreshed no coffee and the fridge didn't work, wasn't informed about this."
830,David,2021-12-01,"Good very nice room, location excellent with being near the railway station, good choice of breakfast. Down side - not enough choice of beers (ales) in the hotel bar (personal choice)"
831,Case,2021-12-01,Superb The room was a good size.
832,Maarit,2021-12-01,"Superb The reception and breakfast as well as Recess dinner staff were lovely. The lady (seemed to be the manager) at breakfast was super busy, but still had time to have a little chat with us which was very nice. The breakfast itself was delicious. The selection was nice and the food looked good on display. The reception offered us a bigger room, because we were travelling with a baby. That made us feel seen and understood. Thank you. The Recess dinner menu in our opinion was a bit overpriced. The portions were small. But the food itself was delicious."
833,John,2021-11-29,"Great trip to the Hilton Nice room, plenty of facilities and the guest service was nice when I asked for new towels. The waiting service was excellent and we both liked the food. Minibar could have been stocked and the TV remote might not have been working properly."
834,Henry,2021-11-29,"All in, good. Disappointed with the food Room was nice, clean, very happy generally. Good location I was told there was a vegan breakfast, and paid 9.99 for it. However, it was just the sides of others - prefer it if you didn't advertise it as vegan, when it's just mushrooms, tomatoes, beans and greens."
835,Theodorosntagiantis,2021-11-28,Great stay Already wrote a review on TripAdvisor but yeah 8/10 Heating in room could be working properly
836,Rebecca,2021-11-28,"Superb Clean comfortable room, friendly staff.... spotless front of house. Well done all."
837,Lynette,2021-11-26,"Very good central location, nice restaurant and very pleasant staff"
838,Paul,2021-11-24,We have stayed before so knew what to expect and will be happy to stay again Breakfast was excellent. Overall a good experience
839,Jan,2021-11-24,"Enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back. The hotel was in a good location, walking distance to the train station and the city centre. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and attentive, especially Leonardo who served behind the bar. We were place on the laundry floor and could hear the machines in the middle of the night."
840,Michael,2021-11-24,comfortable stay nice and easy access to rooms etc. Very difficult to find the car park due to roads closed nearby. A route map would of been handy.
841,Jackie,2021-11-24,"Comfortable stay - little overpriced About 15 mins walk from Bristol Hippodrome. Staff great. Room size ok, mini cooler kept water cool, bed firm which I like and pillows comfy. Excellent choice of breakfast and good value at £10 - included full english, pastries, continental, juice, fruit, cereal etc even had a decaf latte!!! Comfortable bar/restaurant. No usb ports in room - bit gutted as I didn't think to take the plug for phone so couldn't charge but in fairness description didn't say it so can't complain really. Comfortable stay but overall a little expensive - 180 for a double room. No info in room on safety procedures, restaurant opening times, bar menu etc."
842,Lorna,2021-11-24,"£94 for a room was more than I would normally pay but the hotel still made it value for money for good Bristol location location,"
843,Jacqueline,2021-11-23,"great for a short stay location great , twin room clean and comfortable"
844,Jennifer,2021-11-23,"Good location for the city , friendly welcoming staff Very helpful and friendly staff . Good location , parking on site . Restaurant on site."
845,Sam,2021-11-22,Si senor give the ball to Diaz parking right out the front of the hotel. short walk to the city centre I believe I got a good price for the hotel so I got good value for money as the rooms were comfortable and they had orchard pig cider in the bar couple with a bererton Diaz equaliser for rovers I’ll take a point back up north content. Bristol is excellent. nothing
846,Shannon,2021-11-21,"Very good Receptionist and restaurant staff were very friendly and happy to help. Had a great nights sleep No parking, we had to pay £53 in another car park for 2 nights !! The hotel should offer discount for certain car parks around the city for the people staying at the hotwl"
847,Dina,2021-11-21,comfortable comfort show room
848,Andrea,2021-11-20,"pleasant stay, would recommend for a short break to Bristol Clean, comfortable, modern. Good basic facilities bed was squeaky, but not a major issue"
849,Perry,2021-11-20,Perfect for a short stay Clean and modern All good nothing not to like.
850,Jeff,2021-11-19,"We liked the hotel itself and all the staff we had dealings with were courteous and very helpful. We did have lunch in t Good location for us. Room clean and comfortable, loved the extra large bed. Double glazing amazing, couldn’t hear a sound from the busy road below, (we were on 4th floor). Large TV was great. Staff friendly and helpful. En suite facilities a little on the small side, but clean and in good condition."
851,Beth,2021-11-18,"short and very sweet! great and central, exactly what I needed. comfy room, nice staff and a good breakfast I perhaps wouldn’t stay more than a few nights as it’s right on a busy main road … However the rooms are soundproof, so absolutely no issues with sleeping!"
852,Rachel,2021-11-17,"Good location, rooms a little small The location is good for the station and the town centre. Lifts are very quick! The park opposite is a nice green space. Room was well equipped. Clean facilities and pleasant staff. The shower room is very small but the shower is powerful. The bed was quite firm (not as comfy as a Premier Inn bed!). The hotel is on a very busy road so quite noisy. The receptionist moved us to a room at the back which is quieter. She did this unasked when she saw our age and how long we were staying (4 nights) which was kind."
853,Radosveta,2021-11-17,"We had a pleasant stay. Overall a comfortable hotel, great location. The room was very clean and the bed comfortable. It was very noisy in the late afternoon/early evening. The entrance to the parking was quite difficult to find."
854,Mcdougall,2021-11-16,"Great place shame about the breakfast The room, the breakfast and the location were all excellent. I thought that the breakfast were included in the price"
855,Kevin,2021-11-13,Overall vey good and I would return Room and location. Only thing was that the breakfast buffet had the worst sausages I have ever had in my long life.
856,Ioannis,2021-11-13,"Very good Clean and cosy hotel with nice breakfast Our fridge wasn't working and although the receptionists knew it, we were not informed and we had to explicitly ask for it to be fixed, once we discovered it. Also, we felt that the staff at the breakfast area were always in a hurry to close before time, as they started cleaning, and taking our dishes at 9.45 and that was a bit stressful."
857,Edward,2021-11-11,Nice enough Clean room Took a long time to check in. Parking is awful!
858,Afolayan,2021-11-11,"Was good in general. Good location, I think the carpet in the rooms needs to be changed. Carpet."
859,Allana,2021-11-09,"great birthday night away and would recommend to others. friendly and well mannered staff, clean hotel and good location to walk into the city centre a little pricey for the car park but I suppose it’s to be expected in a city,"
860,Ann,2021-11-09,"Very happy with the hotel. Would definitely stay there again. Breakfast was very good value for money. I'm gluten intolerant, staff very kindly arranged gluten free toast every morning. Pointed out what was safe to eat. Room was clean and comfortable. There's a little mini fridge in the room. Really handy . Location is 5 mins from Bristol temple meads train station. Quiet at night. Lovely restaurant & nice choice of food. We felt the room was cold on arrival. We tried to alter the air conditioning, but still blew cold air. Turned it off. Shower was not strong enough, weak water pressure. Apart from that our weekend was really great."
861,Evelyn,2021-11-09,Restful My stay at the hotel was everything I expected to be and the staff were exceptional - Even though we arrived at 1040 for breakfast on the Saturday the choice and quality was far better than I expected and the experience and friendliness of the catering staff was a exceptional - A good kick start to a very full itinerary on that day. HOWEVER I telephoned a few days prior to the visit to correct an error in the booking and ask a question about parking - After a strange delay in connection my enquiry - which I considered to be perfectly valid - was dealt with in a less than courteous manner and I rang off with the unacceptable feeling of 'Why Did I Bother ? and that same error was present on my booking when I arrived - Yet the very nice lady at the reception corrected it with a smile and no hassle. My actual stay was superb and my colleague was exceedingly pleased as well. See above and in my particular room felt the bathroom was a little cramped but entirely functional - The tightness had obviously been experienced before as the toilet roll holder had received a knock or something before and was loose on the wall. - Plus i would have liked a better hook behind the door for my dressing gown. Plus = Apart from a group of men that were very much into their cups at 3am on the Sunday morning and who decided to discuss when they should meet the next day outside my door {But this was not the fault of the hotel and well beyond their care} - Overall I was very impressed with the quietness in the room and we both slept extremely well
862,Harry,2021-11-08,Good value. Very clean room. Comfy bed. Common areas and hallways are a little shabby.
863,Angela,2021-11-08,comfortable stay comfy bed breakfast was a bit cold
864,Stuart,2021-11-07,above average comfortable clean and convenient with a very good breakfast no where to park as car park was full. spent ages trying to find somewhere
865,Terri,2021-11-06,"Exceeded my expectations, would stay again! Was very impressed with this hotel. For the price of the room I wasn’t expecting amazing things, however upon arrival I was very surprised. I was immediately greeted with a very clean lobby and friendly reception staff. The room we had was on the top floor which meant a lovely view, the room was very large, clean and well presented. To show that nobody had been in the room after housekeeping, stickers were placed over the doors which I think is a brilliant idea considering covid circumstances ect. There was also a mini fridge in the room which was a delight! Definitely worth the money!! We also tried out the bar and had some food which was delicious. The servers were incredibly polite and everything was priced very fairly for the quality!! The hotel itself is a 5 minute walk from the train station and was in a perfect location!"
866,Christopher,2021-11-06,A quick getaway it’s location to we’re we wanted to go. The staff. we’re friendly. and welcoming the room was clean and comfortable Amdahl while the gym was small it was well equipped for anyone needing their exercise fix. the only disappointing thing was breakfast on the first morning they appeared to have difficulty keeping up with demand with some items. Unless you were getting your food close to coming out of te kitchen it it cold very quickly.
867,John,2021-11-05,"Great location, comfy bed, clean facilities. Friendly staff. Breakfast could be improved. Room was fine. Bed was comfortable. Temperature was easy to control. As I was there for work I didn't stay in the room that much. The bathroom was small, but serviceable and clean. Shower was good! Breakfast was average - buffets are a hard thing to get right. The breakfast could have been better. I know hot buffets are never as good as freshly cooked food, but this one was a little on the lukewarm side. It was fine. But it wasn't game-changing. I ate at local cafes the following days."
868,Vanessa,2021-11-04,"Clean rooms Receptionist upgraded our room for a double bed instead of twin bed at no extra cost There is only one option of parking which is £16 for 24 hours, which I thought was a bit expensive."
869,Uma,2021-11-04,"Great stay, Lovely reception staff, Clean hotel Room was clean Hotel in a good location as I am an avid walker thus nothing was too far. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel. a Tesco, Pret and Gregs is nearby so didn't have breakfast at the hotel. Room was not cleaned on a daily basis - you had to make a request at reception the night before if you wanted the room cleaned. This was due to maintaining social distancing post CV. I think a sign outside the door should suffice if you didn't want the room to be cleaned. This is not an issue really but wanted to share as a FYI only."
870,John,2021-11-02,very nice helpful receptionist really enhanced our stay reasonable price and receptionist was very helpful and professional - let us check in early which was really helpful as we were on a short break 3 nights and our time was limited. Also allowed us to store our luggage on the day if checkout rooms a little small but overall was good value for money
871,Holly,2021-11-02,Very good Very welcoming! Cherry looked after us and showed us interesting places to visit and bars to go that were around Bristol - we had a lovely time! :)
872,Helen,2021-11-02,great very clean
873,Samantha,2021-11-01,Good Breakfast was good room comfy For the price of the room expected breakfast to be included also carpark is £16 for 24hrs but you only get the room for 21hrs
874,Jayne,2021-11-01,"Lovely Hotel in Bristol Very clean hotel, lovely staff great breakfast"
875,Guanyao,2021-10-31,Good Clean. nice staff nice location Room next to elevator a bit noisy at night
876,Vickers,2021-10-31,Good Staff friendly and helpful. Good cocktails. Comfy beds. Fridge in rooms a bonus. No hassles. Not too far from the centre but area not too inspiring. A nice little park and ruin next to it though which helped. The hotel is generic but I didn't expect anything else. A decent stay all in all.
877,Helen,2021-10-31,Sleek and smart beds were large and comfortable modern decor large windows overlooking park swivel chair! parking was stressful approach to hotel with building works was terrible. hotel should provide instructions as at least one road was closed and meant we had to turn round twice to get access.
878,Nichola,2021-10-30,Very good It was in a good location and close to Temple Meads station. Nothing.
879,Peter,2021-10-30,Very good Staff were all very helpful and friendly - as I am quite used to with most Hilton properties
880,Andrew,2021-10-29,"Bristol is a great city, and the hotel met all of our requirements. The hotel is close to the station, and just a 5 or 10 minute walk to the central areas. First impressions are that the hotel is smart, bright, clean and business-like. Staff were welcoming and helpful. Rooms were a decent size and comfortable, self-service breakfasts were of good quality with plenty of choice. The design and decor is conservative, nothing special, but that is purely a matter of personal taste, and I have no criticisms."
881,Russell,2021-10-29,ideal hotel for our 3 night stay The hotel was central and easy walking distance to docks and shopping centres Nothing
882,Alexis,2021-10-28,"Superb Room was well equipped bed comfy and was very impressed with the soundproofing. Our room overlooked a busy road and there was absolutely no traffic noise. Very helpful and friendly staff. Ambiance of the bar wasn't very appealing. Also, the drink cans we bought to take to our room were very expensive."
883,Funbi,2021-10-28,"I had a good stay and staff were very friendly and the room was nice The room was really nice and I liked the view I would have liked to have dinner in my room, but there was no room service"

885,Dave,2021-10-25,"Location superb, handy for station, bars, pubs, sight seeing Location superb, very quiet, comfortable, cosy, plenty of tea and coffee, great place"
886,Philippa,2021-10-25,"Very good Clean, comfortable room. Parking was very difficult as was access due to closed roads etc."
887,Andrew,2021-10-25,Good value for money hotel. I was given a rear facing room as the hotel was not overly busy.
888,856283839,2021-10-25,Very good We had an amazing dinner at the hotel restaurant. The staff there was particularly nice and they made us feel very welcome.
889,Nicola,2021-10-24,"Relaxing and comfortable, in a good location. Great value for money The location was fantastic for getting into the city centre. Staff were friendly and helpful. The shower was always hot, bed very comfortable and the bar/restaurant area was great too."
890,Mark,2021-10-24,"Enjoyable relaxing stay, would stay again especially considering how wonderful staff. Breakfast very good, good variety of cold or cooked food. Had one evening meal which was again very good, although slightly restricted menu. Staff are brilliant both in the restaurant and on reception, so friendly, chatty and helpful. Great location city centre 20 minute walk, restaurants 10 - 15 minutes. 20 minutes to harbour with historic sites and buzzing cafes, bars and restaurants. The bed - hard, lumpy with very noisy springs, couldn't move without twangs, grinds and clunks,"
891,Raj,2021-10-24,"Great Staff, Food and Location Staff members were great. Any help you ask for..they were able to help Food - Had dinner and breakfast once. Brilliant food. Location - 10-15 mins walk to all the places - railway station, City Centre, Cabot circus for shopping and near the bus station Room - The room was adapted for guests with disability. so found it difficult for us to move around the room Bed - Bed was little hard / rigid"
892,Grace,2021-10-23,"Girls night away It was very central to shopping and lots of restaurants and bars only a short walk away. Good location, nice and quiet so got a good nights sleep too. The parking was an issue as the hotel is hard to drive too when you don’t know Bristol well. Maybe instructions should be written clearer."
893,Craig,2021-10-23,Perfect base for a stay in Bristol. Friendly staff. Very clean. Good location. Friendly and helpful staff No issues to discuss. Very satisfied.
894,Olive,2021-10-22,"Will stay again Served my last minute need as I forfeited the other place I paid to stay I was safe, staff very helpful. Clean room"
895,Julie,2021-10-22,Get up really early for breakfast!!! Room was clean and the beds were incredibly comfortable. Breakfast. Queues were really long and items were constantly running out. Poor staff were run ragged. Much better to book a time at reception as in other hotels to manage the flow of traffic and improve customer experience. It is not a cheap hotel after all.
896,John,2021-10-20,Very good Good and plenty of choice.
897,Iain,2021-10-20,Great hotel.. Wonderful staff.. It was all good👍 Staff are great and the location is perfect for central Bristol.. I will use this hotel as my regular stay..
898,Andy,2021-10-20,"OK but for a Hilton Hotel would expect more client service. Room was nice, staff excellent and location is very good. parking is a bit steep when you are a paying guest. Breakfast was cold and you had to do it all of yourself, make your own hot drink, toast and serve yourself so not really value for money and for it to then be cold ? Had better food in a weatherspoon I am afraid."
899,Fifiminkle,2021-10-19,Bristol trip  Comfy bed. Friendly staff. Good value for money.
900,Rodney,2021-10-18,"Good location, great value for money, very clean with helpful friendly staff Very good selection of cereal juices and cooked item Staff where very helpful Nothing"
901,Neil,2021-10-18,Very good Location was good for railway station. Breakfast was ideal with plenty of options. Price for the 3 nights was high but given that the Bristol marathon was on that weekend prices are always inflated because of the demand. Expensive but guess that's what hotels do alas..
902,Brown,2021-10-16,"Did what was needed. Parking is bad, over charged on parking. Confusing bill payment. Cheaper parking and more parking. Options to have a cold breakfast as an alternative to paying for both hot and cold regardless."
903,Yee,2021-10-15,Superb Self service laundry. Good for drying clothes in rainy day. Poor sound proofing
904,Christine,2021-10-14,"Weekend Trip Great location not far from the station and the city centre. Corridor a little noisy at night, otherwise a lovely stay."
905,Paul,2021-10-13,Very good Breakfast. Room. Staff. Gym. Price. Room size.
906,David,2021-10-13,"Very good  The address, Temple Way and post code when inputted to a sat nav takes you to the front of the hotel, which has no access by car far from Temple Way. You have to arrive at the back of the hotel to park."
907,Yasmin,2021-10-12,"Exceptional breakfast and staff Breakfast and staff were exceptional. Fresh waffles and knowledgable, helpful and friendly staff who showed us where to go on a map they provided which tailored to our needs. Couple of minutes walk from the city centre and the harbour. Slightly pricey but it's a hilton. Room a bit on the small side but fine."
908,Jeff,2021-10-12,"Ideal location, very comfortable, lovely staff Great location in walking distance of the city & harbour area. Bus stops right outside the door. Superb breakfast being replenished constantly so fresh and hot, caters for all. Queen room was very small, but was clean and comfortable. Helpful friendly staff making you feel very welcomed. Queen room was disappointingly quite small, but was clean and comfortable."
909,Esme,2021-10-11,Superb Nice big comfortable room. Very clean and nice service.
910,Kat,2021-10-10,"Standard but good value Very clean, friendly service with fast check in and check out. Good value, walking distance to the centre. Hard to find using standard maps! You have to access from the one way systems, which took us a while! The bed was hard, but the room was otherwise very comfortable!"
911,Brian,2021-10-09,Superb The upbeat and obliging staff The coffee making machine.....it's the first time I have encountered problems with such a device
912,Rachel,2021-10-09,"Very good The location was perfect for us. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Cherry! The bed was to hard for us."
913,James,2021-10-09,"Very good Great location in centre of town. Limited parking outside hotel, I got the last space. Parking is expensive. Breakfast was very good and don’t have to checkout till 12. Expensive, parking"

917,Sue,2021-09-30,"Short break in Bristol Good location about 10 minutes walk from the station and within walking distance of the main attractions, pubs and restaurants. Nice restaurant serving excellent food. Comfortable, quiet and extremely clean room with a nice view of Temple Gardens at the back of the hotel. Small gym but enough for a short break. Friendly, welcoming staff. Nothing."
918,Steve,2021-09-28,Very good Super location and staff excellent
919,Ranadi,2021-09-28,Exceptional staff upgraded our overall experience from meh to very good! The housecleaning and reception staff were exceptionally helpful and very friendly. Comfy beds. Handy for the trains and bus links and only a short walk to the city centre Fridge in our room smelt funny Coffee machine was broken and buffet cold meats and cheeses were uncovered so guests were able to cough over it - so we went down the road to Barrista's for a good coffee and light breakfast for the rest of our stay. Seemed pricey for what was offered
920,Enrico,2021-09-27,"Superb position is walking distance from city center, professional and kind staff nice restaurant with good food and beer using excuse of covid to stop cleaning the room and restoring room supplies (shampoo, showegel, coffee, etc...)"

923,Ayesha,2021-09-22,"All good Breakfast was great, staff very friendly and helpful, the only downside was the location really as it is a little out of the way from the centre of Bristol but it’s very handy for getting to the train station"
924,Nick,2021-09-20,"Will be happy to stay here again Decent location, clean facilities and friendly staff. Duty manager who was actually finished for the day, was particularly helpful when I was locked out of my room as the key card got deactivated. Stayed at this chain of hotels before and had hoped for a coffee machine but just had a basic kettle. Friendly staff but check in took ages and not everyone likes chit chat. Just glad I got there before the coach tour party checked in."
925,David,2021-09-20,"an excelent venue,well situated to accessing the attractions the city of Bristol Breakfast,good selection plus excelent staff. Evening meal ,limited selection but well presented and tasty. Room facilities excelent and comfortable. Staff always cheerfull and very helpful A bit of difficulty accessing hotel because of ongoing traffic development in the area,maybe could have advised customers in advance"
926,Philip,2021-09-20,convenient and comfortable. Good location. Had air con. Good bar. Helpful staff even later at night. Nothing really.

931,Jia,2021-09-14,"Very nice and close to centre! Had lots of fun just shame about the fridge cooler Great staff and very clean, and well air conditioned The fridge cooler was not actually cold or working and was the same as room temperature so we couldn't leave any fizzy drinks and leftover take away food inside to keep overnight for next day, although the staff offered kindly to take our stuff for us, we felt little bad to bother them Tuesday morning there was a fire alarm kind of going on and off in the morning but we weren't told about a ""check"" because it went off after 5 seconds. Then started again then stopped again"
932,Darksilver,2021-09-13,Good Clean and comfortable An alarm went off both mornings apparently it could be to do with steam from showers

935,Linda,2021-09-11,"Very good The hotel was nice and central, clean and bright with friendly staff We had to pay an extortionate amount for parking which was not very clear when we booked. We did get an email regarding this but after we booked. The parking cost needs to be clearer at time of actual booking. We were lucky to get a space. If the hotel/city had been busier parking would have been an issue."
936,Roman,2021-09-10,Good food and drink and service .But parking on site was expensive.  Parking expensive.
937,Beverley,2021-09-09,A enjoyable break that wasn't spoilt by the hotel but only enhanced by it. Location to train station n city centre.and the staff was very accomendating. No issues to report
938,Helen,2021-09-08,"Very good The location being just out of the main hub of the city and by Temple gardens which was great, and therefore not so busy. The staff were wonderful and friendly. The facilities were great, and everywhere was very clean which was reassuring. The only downside to the stay was the constant white noise buzzing in the room (from the air/heating con I presume - even though I had the system on the off button) which was annoying at night and did not make for a very restful night's sleep. Ear plugs came in handy. But that was the only downside to an otherwise great stay."
939,David,2021-09-07,"Good hotel for city break or business travel. Nice city centre hotel, good value for money. Nice room, decent breakfast. Easy to walk and get something to eat. Free parking from 6pm till 8am then you need to pay. All in all it is as expected, if not slightly better."
940,Deborah,2021-09-05,"Great location and friendly staff Breakfast was ok, staff very friendly and helpful Bathroom a little small"
941,Maddie,2021-09-05,"Clean, safe, good base for exploring Clean rooms Lovely staff on reception who were very helpful with our checkin Well equipped rooms- ample wardrobe space with enough hangers, mini fridge, iron and ironing board."
942,David,2021-09-03,"quick stop over no problems Comfortable enough, central location only stayed one night"
943,Mariya,2021-09-03,"Very good The staff at Bristol is absolutely lovely. Friendly, helpful, gracious and really kind. It was impressive. The location was a little tired. Hilton's in general are not great value for money: rooms are way too small given the price."
944,Jodie,2021-09-03,Superb It was a convenient location close to all amenities - the staff were really welcoming expecially Peter at the reception desk who couldn’t do enough to help us throughout our stay The parking situation - when the car park was full the hotel allowed people to park in unmarked bays meaning at 10am when I came to leave I couldn’t as a work van was blocking me in - this is annoying having paid £32 for two days parking only to be blocked in and the hotel allowing it as they know how much they have taken in parking fees why would they continue to take money and allow people to park there blocking others and Delaying my exit by around 30 mins

947,Lavinia,2021-08-30,"Pleasant stay at Hilton Garden Inn The room was very spacious, very clean and the staff was very friendly! I'll definitely come back again. The bed was quite uncomfortable, I couldn't sleep at all :("
948,Abigail,2021-08-30,"Very good The rooms were lovely but I booked a garden view and got a view of the building across the road. Booked a afternoon tea for two, waitress wasn’t overly helpful as it seems it was too much hassle to do the afternoon tea. After we finished and left the restaurant had many phone calls chasing payment but I had already told them what room we were staying in and to put the payment on the room before we sat down in restaurant 🤷‍♀️"
949,Michelle,2021-08-30,"Good clean, good staff room small, bathroom very small, no bath. no fridge"
950,Helen,2021-08-29,Hilton Gardens Inn Hotel Very clean and staff couldn’t have been more helpful and friendly Nothing
951,Michelle,2021-08-28,Very enjoyable Excellent location. Friendly helpful staff Vegetarian sausages for breakfast
952,Richard,2021-08-27,Generally high standard throughout. Very high standard of accommodation and general hotel facilities and staffing with especially helpful reception staff Access to the various parking facilities was difficult to negotiate and more information in advance would have been helpful
953,Carolyn,2021-08-26,"Good location, clean and comfortable Good location being only a short walk from Bristol Temple Meads station. We were going to a gig at the Exchange and it was a short walk from there as well. The hotel is clean and relatively comfortable. We had a snack in the bar which was very good. It had all the things we needed for a weekend. Nothing I didn't like"
954,Stephen,2021-08-25,Convenient hotel for centre. Clean with friendly staff Location good for the centre of Bristol. Hotel clean and staff friendly. Thought £16 expensive for car parking.
955,Kushlani,2021-08-25,"Good Central location and was clean. Breakfast was not well organised and seemed bit chaotic at times. Tables were not cleared promptly, no hot water for tea and had to ask. Breakfast was not worth the amount charged."
956,Val,2021-08-24,"Excellent location, staff and value for money. Everything was fine. Too many requests for feedback!"
957,Andy,2021-08-24,Superb Clean hotel in a great location for our needs with friendly staff
958,David,2021-08-23,"Good Good Location clean staff very helpful No bottled water in room ,parking limited and quite expensive"
959,Geraldine,2021-08-23,"This was our first visit to Btistol, we thoroughly enjoyed it, lots to see and do. Breakfast was very good lots of choices. The location is also very good. No complaints about stay."
960,Michael,2021-08-23,Its one of the better value class hotels in Bristol - who need say more Its just a very nice big modern hotel with all creature comforts - it has a few parking spaces which you must pay not a small fee for but if you know the Bristol parking situation you will snap one up at that price quite happily - i stayed twice and parked there twice Nothing negative to report only the car parkign situation which is horrid all over Bristol and no fault of the Hotels at all
961,Andrew,2021-08-23,Mask wearing The hotel was in a great location and the staff were very welcoming and accommodating. You are informed before your arrival and there are signs in the hotel that customers are expected to wear masks when in the general areas of the hotel. This was not policed however and was particularly concerning in the buffet breakfast area where people were leaning over the food without masks on and with no checks that people had sanitised their hands.
962,Anthony,2021-08-21,"dry, over heated, probaly not fresh enough . Location great. room - modern and comfortable. breakfast - poor and dried out"
963,Palwinder,2021-08-20,"Very good Room service was too good, staff was very friendly and helpfull. bed and room furniture was looks very old."
964,Sheena,2021-08-20,Very good Small fridge in the room was really useful. Quiet rooms - no noisy neighbours...
965,David,2021-08-19,Superb Fairly central Road works made approach difficult
966,Yvonne,2021-08-19,Excellent Breakfast nice
967,Leon,2021-08-17,"Very good Clean, friendly staff. Nice restaurant Little tricky to find as postcard takes you to a different hotel and the main access road to the hotel was blocked off."
968,Andrew,2021-08-16,"City break gem Friendly welcoming staff, plentiful breakfast buffet (although not as fresh on Monday morning). Cannot fault the location for all Bristol attractions and Temple Meads station. Like all chain hotels, it is a little sterile and featureless. Also, to have to keep requesting small housekeeping / room items started to become a little tiresome. As we emerge from Covid, please could we investigate reinstating some way of saying “please service my room”."
969,Rumana,2021-08-15,"It was definitely good! room, location I explained before I need gluten free, dairy free diet. Staff at the breakfast floor were not well prepared for this. I would have liked to see gluten free cereal options."
970,Liam,2021-08-15,Weekend away Very good location and good staff Found a pair of old dirty knickers in one of the bed side table which was very very grim
971,Albert,2021-08-14,Superb It does what it say on the box

976,Kay,2021-08-09,Good Clean and tidy Lots of cleaning in evidence Staff very helpful The room was too hot for me - even with air conditioning Lots of customers had no masks . The staff were all masked which I appreciated
977,Minnette,2021-08-09,Superb The room was a large one Car parking facilities a bit restricted
978,Robert,2021-08-09,"Great Great location, clean, felt safe Nothing really, odd stains on wall and carpet"
979,Diane,2021-08-09,"ok for a couple of nights alone but room on the small size for two The room was fine and understand why have to request extra supplies. Check out was easy. Bathroom supplies good. Felt buffet breakfast a bit too much at these times. Would have preferred to be served. Ham was frozen, fruit choice poor. Location was ok, but the parking price was extortionate. Menu lacked interesting things, very basic but prices very high. Freeview TV lacked many basic channels."
980,Stephen,2021-08-09,Superb Hotel was perfect for a three night stay in central Bristol. Breakfast was excellent and the overriding positive was the warmth and friendliness of the staff. A well motivated and excellent team of people throughout. Size of room particularly the bathroom. Orange juice at breakfast was a little weak. Otherwise everything else was very good.
981,Michelle,2021-08-08,Very good Location easy to get about to attractions Some information should be provided about the location of the parking as not easily accessible due to roadworks.
982,Donna,2021-08-07,"Really convenient, comfy and good value for money Shower was larger than in previous rooms I have stayed in. Very nice Although I had travelled by coach and found it easily from the station my friend travelled by car and found it difficult to access the car park."
983,Ian,2021-08-07,Superb  Handy for station and town
984,Katie,2021-08-05,"Comfortable, very clean The bed was very comfy, the cleaning standards were also top notch with partnership with detol. Location was a bit of a walk to the centre about 20 mins, we thought it was closer but our mistake. I must admit, it did seem quite standard for a hotel. It reminded me of just a brand new premier inn, there were no “luxuries” with the stay."
985,Jenny,2021-08-03,Good Comfortable clean bedroom and en suite and reasonable breakfast with lovely coffee
986,Theresa,2021-08-01,Great hotel Location..cleans rooms and good breakfast
987,Shaun,2021-08-01,"Parking  Parking, getting into the car park was extremely difficult with all the work that was going on around the hotel. A more detailed explanation on the web site on how to”get there” would have helped !"

991,T,2021-07-30,"Very good The staff , very friendly and helpful . Especially when they have to put up with rude guests. The bed wasn't very comfortable , but it would do for 2 sleeps. The coffee in the room was horrid."

994,Ferdian,2021-07-29,"Good place to stay Clean room and close proximity to Cabot Circus and Bristol Temple Meads. Soap and shampoo could be more,"
995,Sue,2021-07-26,"Very comfortable hotel, near the City centre The breakfast was fantastic and staff were friendly…. Great location for discovering what Bristol has to offer Telling us about roadworks around the hotel as we couldn’t get to the car park"
996,Yvonne,2021-07-26,Lovely stay and handy for train station I stayed here to meet up with my husband. We then drove onto north Cornwall the next day! We had onsite car parking. Hotel about 6 minutes walk to Bristol temple meads train station. Rooms were comfortable and very clean. It overlooks a lovely park that we walked through. Air conditioning was so handy with the weather being so hot.
997,Veerle,2021-07-25,"Leave your car at home Big room, good bed, air on, soft linen, quiet. It was very hard to find with google maps because of blocked roads."
998,Charlotte,2021-07-24,"Very good The location was perfect, bed was very comfy."
999,Mayuko,2021-07-22,"Great breakfast but basic room for the price Great breakfast, good fitness room and useful location Room was very basic, tiny toilet, air con very old fashioned and TV lacking many standard Freeview channels"
1000,Nelesh,2021-07-19,Great location and the stay was comfortable. Location and staff very friendly and efficient. Quality of the cooked breakfast was average.
1001,Jonathan,2021-07-17,Great place to stay Clean covid secure environment. Car parking very crowded and tricky to manoeuvre in.
1002,Caroline,2021-07-17,Nice hotel and friendly staff The outside area to sit and have a drink was nice. Cot they put in the room was large and bedding included. The car parking charge and that the wrong room type was allocated at first. Had to wait a while to get a new room.
1003,Isham,2021-07-15,Great location. Lady at front desk gave amazing customer service. Price was expensive just for 1 night. Parking a bit annoying too not being able to book in advance.

1005,Kornelija,2021-07-13,"xxx What I loved the most is the staff: so friendly helpful and kind, but apart from that, everything's been decent - brilliant! For such a price...happy days lol x Quick quick, man's hungry. Ain't your fault tho haha"
1006,Suzanne,2021-07-12,Superb Room clean and tidy. Lovely breakfast staff excellent Peter on reception was very friendly. We really loved this hotel only one annoying thing which wasn’t the hotels fault. The stay was perfect apart from Saturday night Inconsiderate lads moving from room to room keeping me awake for over 3 hours and we didnt get to sleep till 4am. Shouting and being a complete nuisance.
1007,Chris,2021-07-08,Superb Peter on reception very helpful and the restaurant manageress very good. hard-working too Rooms a little small for 2
1008,Mary,2021-07-04,"Very good  I don't like breakfast room, restaurant and bar all being the same room."

1010,Mabel,2021-07-03,Comfy stay Buffet breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff. Room was clean. Key card kept needing to be reset at front desk. Got a new keycard midway through the stay which solved the issue
1011,Hilary,2021-06-30,Superb Very good location with car parking. Very comfortable bed and all very clean. Good shower. Helpful staff. Our 3rd stay and will definitely return.
1012,Sheila,2021-06-30,Very good Closeness to the station visiting family
1013,Paul,2021-06-28,"Would go back, but request room away from lifts Location great. Staff friendly/helpful If I had to add a negative, room was near lifts (elevators) so quite a bit of noise from lift motors."
1014,Gaynor,2021-06-28,Very good We really enjoyed meeting Paulo who was very friendly and welcoming to us on our first night stay. The extras mount up and I would have preferred to have car parking and breakfast included.
1015,Chuck,2021-06-27,Superb The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The food was excellent too. The cost for the room is similar to London prices.
1016,Timothy,2021-06-23,"Overnight stay Good location and felt very COVID safe, staff very polite and made you feel very welcome, explain evacuation procedures due to having my mum who has walking difficult. The breakfast was to a very high standard and again following government guidelines. Parking very limited"
1017,Hannah,2021-06-20,4* not what it used to be The room and rest of hotel was impeccably clean. The staff were very polite and friendly The gym was great - had the whole place to myself (due to COVID) restrictions. Breakfast was lovely. The Hilton brand used to carry a premium reputation however some of their hotels are not much different now to a stay in a premier inn. The room itself was average. Fairly small with a bathroom that needed TLC (peeling ceiling and generally tired). The air con was also noisy and limp making sleeping on a hot night difficult.
1018,Naomi,2021-06-19,"Good location, clean and friendly. Clean room, friendly staff, great location. The bed wasn’t very comfortable but we were only staying one night so it wasn’t such a drama."
1019,Sue,2021-06-14,"Lovely hotel in great position Hotel is in an excellent position a short walk from the river and man attractions. It has the added bonus of on site parking for £16 a day, which runs from the time that you hack in, so we were able to leave the car there after check out while we went out for dine lunch. (Worth noting when you are thinking about the time to arrive) Staff were friendly and helpful, single beds comfortable and a decent size and it’s really nice to stay somewhere that allows you to leave the hectic main City behind after a days site seeing. Loads of great bars and restaurants in walking distance and a quiet tranquil park opposite the hotel. Highly recommended. The air con wasn’t working and even though we reported it, no one came to fix it. It did leave the room a bit uncomfortable at night but not enough to stop us returning another time."
1020,Gregjc,2021-06-11,"June trip Room clean and in good repair, staff were helpful. Selection of channels and user interface was on tv was very poor"
1021,Marian,2021-06-08,Post code Easy to walk into town and nice quiet location with excellent staff Finding it! Hotel entrance cannot be located using hotel post code Visitors need to be warned that entrance is in a different post code
1022,Sue,2021-06-06,"Nice hotel. Excellent staff. Comfy pillows. Hard bed. VERY loud aircon. Staff were VERY good. The bed was really hard, and the Aircon was so loud! I didn’t get any sleep at all due to this and unfortunately I couldn’t turn it off as the room was VERY hot. The shower had mold 🙈"
1023,Richard,2021-06-05,"Very good Friendly staff greeting on arrival, cleanliness, facilities in room and breakfast Location due to roadwork diversions. Bed was very uncomfortable and creaked badly throughout the night when moving - did not sleep a wink."
1024,Phill,2021-06-04,"Pleasant stay with a comfy bed We have stayed few times before but this time the breakfast was not good, the cooked breakfast wasnt hot and dried out. This was disappointed as we were looking forward to a good hot breakfast. We did request a quite room but was given room right next to lift so we had to request a room change. The breakfast and no information on how to access your car park as it took us 20 mins driving around trying g to find the way in due to all the building works and road closures."
1025,Paula,2021-06-03,"Great location - loved Bristol Location was great, central to everything. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend!"
1026,James,2021-06-03,Kingsize room (normal room with bigger bed) The staff were very friendly and covid safe. The breakfast was good lots to goose from with vegetarian options. Safe parking and good facilities. The room wasn’t what was described.
1027,Susan,2021-06-02,Good The hotel was close to the city centre and was very quiet. The car parking prices were extremely high
1028,Sian,2021-06-02,One night stay Excellent attentive staff. Evening meal very good. Breakfast was ok
1029,Courtney,2021-06-01,"Superb The staff were so helpful, polite and welcoming! The room was a good size and was perfect for what we needed. The location of the hotel is excellent, so easy to walk into the centre. The bed wasn’t overly comfortable."
1030,Joana,2021-06-01,"Best location to coordinate w/ trains (Temple Meads) and not far from the lively Castel Park area. Location to Temple Meads Station and Castle Park/canal. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful at all times. Bar has heated terrace and great outside space to accommodate people in the covid-times. Wine cart is good too. Some noise of the cleaners very early in the morning just outside my room, replenishing of amenities only happened when I asked at reception and quality of TP was below hotel standards."
1031,Samantha,2021-05-31,Weekend Break Fantastic location and very friendly staff. Will definitely be visiting again. Nothing
1032,Heidi,2021-05-31,Superb! Great location. Spotlessly clean. Friendly helpful polite staff. Loved it. Nothing
1033,Maria,2021-05-30,Great Staff were amazing. The bed was hard and very creaky.
1034,Violah,2021-05-30,It was ok Bed was too hard Location is ok though we initially could not find the entrance for the car park due to closed and not sign posted from the main road Breakfast was alright Soft mattress
1035,Joe,2021-05-29,Superb Staff friendly Are sure if cleaning rooms is viable but there 5 days no cleaning
1036,Gem,2021-05-26,Weekend at the garden. Clean room. Parking onsite even though this was a little expensive. Reception very busy on arrival and very difficult to hear. Could have got a hotel closer to the city for the same amount. Bed was very noisy.
1037,Andy,2021-05-25,"Superb The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was large and comfortable. The location was great. Nothing, everything was good."
1038,Patricia,2021-05-24,Very good Close to the centre. Parking charges.Limited parking spaces.
1039,Izabela,2021-05-23,"Ideal for a bit of fun, friendly staff and nice food Free welcome prosecco ❤️ the staff were very helpful, we could take the food inside the room so loved the Sunday breakfast in bed 🛏️🍳 The information about bar opening times (24h everyday for residents) was wrong and very disappointing"
1040,Joseph,2021-05-23,"It was pleasant, and I’ll happily stay there again. Bed was comfy and facilities were good. Nice to have an iron and ironing board (some hotels don’t have them now). My door handle was broken on the Saturday night, luckily it didn’t derail my plans but it was a bit of a pain."
1041,Eleanor,2021-05-22,Comfortable room with friendly welcoming staff. Excellent choice of food for breakfast. Very convenient location - short walk from Temple Meads station. I would rate the dinner in the restaurant lower than the breakfast.
1042,Aidan,2021-05-22,"A clean, modern and friendly city centre hotel, good value for money for a business traveller. Very friendly welcome at reception. Room was spacious and comfortable. Bed was comfy and I slept very well. Large TV on the wall. Good free wifi. Nice bathroom with a good shower. Nice freshly cooked breakfast. All very Covid safe but relaxed. Nothing really, it was spot on for a business traveller."
1043,John,2021-05-14,Great Hotel Helpful and friendly staff & great breakfast....
1044,Caterina,2021-05-04,Very good Lovely room with park view Everything was ok
1045,Malika,2024-04-30,"I have stayed in this hotel several times, but will probably not return. The location is excellent, but the car park is limited and expensive. There should be reference to a cheaper car park on the other side of the hotel. The breakfast was excellent, but otherwise the food menu is limited, portions are smaller than before and quite expensive. Last orders in the restaurant and for room service is at 9.30 pm and food service closes at 10 pm. For early departures, there are no breakfast options. The restaurant gets over-crowded and busy with groups travelling. Other customers at the hotel must sit and eat in the small bar section with a wide screen mostly on sports (soccer) channels. I had booked a room with king-size bed, fridge, laptop safe and balcony. There are no rooms with balcony and also got a room on the noisy street side, not park side. There was a small safe, but no laptop safe and no fridge. The room cost also included bathrobe and slippers that were not in the room and were not provided by the hotel. The management blamed Booking com and agreed to refund only £20 per night. No refund for not having breakfast upon early departure. The manager of the reception, Peter was rather rude and inattentive. This has happened before, too, when my restaurant meals were charged to my room although I paid for the in the restaurant. That led to a long exchange with the hotel to sort out the overcharges.."
1046,Baldwin,2024-04-29,Great time Staff were brilliant. We arrived early and were checked in to the room. All were friendly and accommodating
1047,Fiona,2024-04-28,"Excellent sleep Staff were lovely, the bed was exceptionally comfy. Great location handy for the train station."

1055,Nataliia,2024-04-18,"Super enjoyable My stay at the Hilton hotel was great with fancy stuff and nice people. The staff were really kind and helpful, and they made my stay super enjoyable. I think you should stay at the Hilton hotel if you want a cozy and friendly experience. Nothing"

1057,Paine,2024-04-14,"good location. Poor facilities I slept well. The room and shower were comfortable The internet didn't work when I arrived there. I was told to ring reception on 0, when I checked in, if I had any problems. I rang reception 3 times and no one picked up the phone. I held on at least 2 mins each time."
1058,Patrycja,2024-04-09,"Could be better, needs some refresh Delicious with sweet and sour varieties Bed could be more comfortable, carpet was with staines"

Probably the most uncomfortable bed I've ever tried to sleep in, even after a mattress topper was added I still struggled to get a good night's sleep. Way too hard for me!"
1061,Lisa,2024-04-03,"Would not come back. Staff fabulous. Room really small, hot and not usual standard I have experienced from Hilton. Terrible nights sleep."
1062,Sarah,2024-04-03,"Mediocre, did not live up the price. Fair size car park with spaces. Loved the fact it had fridge in the room. Great you provide free nice smelling toiletries. Rooms smaller than similar chain hotels. Rooms seemed dated, zero view out the window, bed was too small. Lacked plugs on both sides of bed for phone/ watch charging. Bathroom as very compact. Sadly breakfast was not as nice to taste or as nice of an experience as other chain hotels. Nit as central in the city as thought. Car park fee was extortionate!"
1063,Rachel,2024-04-02,would stay again nice room and breakfast
1064,Stephen,2024-04-01,Pleasant Convenient location Staff were very nice Hotel was fairly clean Bed was rock hard Pillows were terrible Room was dinky for a queen
1065,Simone,2024-03-31,"Lovely clean hotel, with very friendly and helpful staff Staff very friendly and helpful, room was clean bed was very comfy, lovely breakfast and in a good location"
1066,Kerry,2024-03-29,"Clean, comfortable, convenient Clean, comfortable, ideal location, a short walk from Temple Meads Station. Everything you'd expect from Hilton."
1067,Madhubanti,2024-03-27,"May return The staff is very friendly, the Bristol station. The hotel is close to Saint Nicholas market, And a short taxi ride away from Glochester shopping area. Are you the only thing I would give feedback on is that the breakfast didn’t have bread - it ran out by the time I got to it."
1068,Vanessa,2024-03-27,Great place to stay Great welcome
1069,Darrell,2024-03-25,"Great staff, great room, great location Great location, friendly helpful staff, nice breakfast & really comfortable bed."
1070,Louise,2024-03-25,"Exceptional We were only staying one night but this hotel was so nice. The staff were friendly, and the room was so nice. Nothing to complain about. Being disabled, we were able to park right outside, and the staff had placed us in a lovely room on the ground floor which was accessible for disabled persons. We didn't use any other facilities other than the room so cannot comment on the restaurant etc, but from what we could see it looked lovely."
1071,Derek,2024-03-24,"Bar closes far too early and food was expensive and poor Room was ok Breakfast wasn’t great Error on bill causing fraud alert, staff couldn’t explain but when checked out staff explained it was an error. I paid for parking and staff put a note in system to say we would be there for 5 nights but I since been issued a £100 fine for one of the nights. Very poor organization"
1072,Robin,2024-03-22,"OK but pricey for what was provided. The receptionists were exceptionally helpful and considerate. One of them helped us find our destination within Bristol. Another provided a walking stick when I was limping and arranged for my wife to have fresh milk. The room was small and with very little space to hang clothes. Also, the bedside lights did not work."
1073,Mary,2024-03-21,"Perfect location, friendly staff - would stay here again. Perfect location, near the train. The staff were all friendly and knowledgeable, helpful. Room was very clean. Very nice desk chair and desk. Only one of the self serve coffee machines was working at breakfast. I'm okay with self serve coffee but it's annoying to make people wait in line to make their own coffee. The coffee & tea supplies in the room were not replenished for my second morning. This was disappointing. The bed was a tad hard but okay. The shower room is looking dated."
1074,Dodden,2024-03-18,"Very poor Location was good . Bar closed early ,no minibar in the room .carpets where filthy. Furniture was old and full of scratches and holes. Fornthebprice, it was shocking we couldn't turn the heating down. So it was so so hot."
1075,Anita,2024-03-18,As expected Room was good and majority of staff were helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was sufficient and good value if included in the price at time of booking. The location is excellent especially if exploring further destination by train. There was an issue with the prepaid breakfasts paid via booking.com however did not show on the booking The Hilton had. We were charged again and double for parking - all got sorted out eventually but it took several trips to the reception desk and one member was abrupt - event though the issue was with them.
1076,Patrick,2024-03-14,I enjoyed my visit. Everything was fine.
1077,Tracy,2024-03-10,"Adequate. Easy check in, parking, nice staff. Small room, small double bed. No water in room , only left out one towel in bathroom. Very adequate but not good value for Money."
1078,Jennie,2024-03-09,Lovely hotel and staff Clean and tidy Well maintained Breakfast was amazing Parking was a nightmare
1079,Stanwah,2024-03-07,Good hotel let down by some minor points Good clean hotel with friendly staff. Location okay not fantastic as there wasnt a great deal in the local area Bed was on wheels so was somewhat noisey Room was cold as air conditioning constantly blew out cold air despite trying to increase the temperature Pillows didnt hold their shape and where somewhat uncomfortable to sleep on
1080,Roger,2024-03-06,Bad housekeeping Perfectly ok hotel. Well located. Pleasant staff. . BUT woke up to find dried bloodstained linen on bed ( bottom pillow and edge of duvet) which had either not been changed and hidden or laundered bloodstained linen has been used. Either way NOT acceptable. Reception staff very apologetic but housekeeping outsourced. Pursuing complaint through booking.com as they can't issue compensation directly which they would have done with a direct booking.
1081,Hebden,2024-03-04,"Could be better. Staff were helpful and pleasant. Nice restaurant. Very hard bed. Basic, bland room. Toilet didn't flush fully. Noisy young guests next door causing problems until 3.30am until I confronted them. :("
1082,Melanie,2024-03-03,"Exceptional The reception staff are consistently excellent. Helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the area. I’ve stayed many times and am always impressed."
1083,Ian,2024-03-02,Passable Was allocated a disabled room A disabled room
1084,Samuel,2024-02-24,Okay but not worth the money Welcoming staff in the restaurant and at front desk The room had not been cleaned properly on arrival (empty bottles) and I had the worst pizza I have ever seen or eaten from this Hotel
1085,William,2024-02-22,Exceptional Close to railway station comfortable great breakfast Nothing to dislike
1086,Richard,2024-02-22,Would not stay again. Reception staff polite and efficient. Good location. Well presented. Difficult to access with very limited car parking. Bed uncomfortable as base not solid. Dreadfull shower as temperature fluctuated from freezing cold to dangerously hot without mixer being touched.
1087,Laura,2024-02-21,"Overpriced and disappointing The location was central and close to attractions. Easy to reach from the coach and railway stations. Breakfast options were good, as were the timings (until 11am at the weekend, which gives you the chance of a lovely lie-in without missing it!) My room felt dark and cramped - sitting on the loo, the toilet roll holder was poking my arm, and I am of average size! There were stains on the carpets and the TV remote control only worked some of the time. No instructions were given on check-in about breakfast (which was included in my room rate), and when I went down in the morning there were no staff at the breakfast buffet and I had to go and ask at reception, where they weren't particularly polite. Overall, not of the standard I was expecting for £100+ per night."
1088,Andrea,2024-02-20,"Overrated: the fourth star is there for the Hilton name, not the quality of service  The absolutely filthy state of the Herman Miller chair in the room left me disgusted. The cleaner barged into the room without knocking around 9am."
1089,Claire,2024-02-18,"Run down hotel, that’s need renovation! The reception staff seemed friendly - the bar and restaurant staff kept asking us to leave feedback with their names so they could get a bonus! The room smelt like sewerage, the drainage is clearly an issue. The air con in the room didn’t work, the sink was cracked and the room was run down… 2 wines cost me £25…"
1090,Mckayla,2024-02-18,"If you order vegan, it won't be vegan. The room was pretty modern and I was on the ground floor. Staff upon check in were friendly. No tissues behind toilet. No conditioner in shower. Menu states Vegan food supplied but the nightime staff told me that isn't true and they just give everyone non vegan food and don't say anything (I was enquiry about the VE 24hour pizza. This is absolutely disgusting. I have a dairy allergy, I could have died. Sausages and mushrooms at breakfast were undercooked. Absolutely not work the £180 (plus breakfast)."
1091,Isabelle,2024-02-18,Not worth the dreadful trek through one way streets and imperfect diversions. Clean I location Lack of snacks etc Small bathroom
1092,Manonamission,2024-02-18,"Corporate room, with onsite parking, and regrettably dreadful breakfast. Good location within a 5-10 min walk of shopping, cultural places, harbourside, and a foodie quarter. Having its own car parking is a huge bonus in busy thriving cities such as Bristol. Sound proofing of the room from the traffic was excellent. In the room, was an empty and working fridge which meant we could chill wine, some proper milk(!), and some fresh nibbles. There was also a safe which was appreciated. Staff were all very pleasant and accommodating. The room was quite 'corporate' and devoid of character. And it felt quite cramped. Coffee/Tea provisions were miserly. Only one towel was in the bathroom though luckily we found another in the wardrobe. Initially we were allocated a twin room despite having booked a king bed, which meant having to traipse back down to reception to have it resolved - which it was. Car parking is quite pricey and feels it's exploiting the fact it is onsite -I guess cheaper alternatives are a short walk away. Biggest disappointment was the cooked breakfast buffet in the morning - undercooked tomatoes (how the?), leathery bacon, anaemic(!) tasteless sausages, rubbery(!) scrambled eggs. It was truly dreadful. I wished I'd chosen continental. (Note - we did find out that you can order eggs any way you want but would have been helpful to know when we entered)."
1093,Alice,2024-02-17,"Comfortable and convenient - set me up for the days work ahead Excellent location for my work in Bristol - comfortable and convenient, good shower and clean bathroom. Breakfast was lovely with good selection. Really appreciated being able to leave my bag after checking out, and to pick it up after my day's work. The chair for the desk in my room seemed to some water stains on the seat which made it feel a bit shabby compared to the high standard elsewhere."
1094,Klaudia,2024-02-16,Very friendly and helpful staff Location and great service Nothing
1095,Hannah,2024-02-15,"Service absolutely amazing but not the best room The staff were absolutely amazing from start to finish, literally couldn’t fault them despite the hotel being busy. The breakfast was great. To be honest the actual room and bathroom looked a bit tired and dated. For the price I don’t feel it met Hilton’s usual high standard. This was a valentines night away with my partner and I was a bit embarrassed at how underwhelmed he was on entering the room."
1096,Ruth,2024-02-14,Exceptional Very comfortable beds and super helpful staff Overpriced biscuits and water
1097,Dakota,2024-02-12,"Great location but poor hotel Location is great here, bus stop directly outside the entrance of hotel, trains station and city centre a few minutes walk. Breakfast had a good selection of food and drinks and was overall quite tasty. Our first room, had a whole in the ceiling and side of arm chairs had been ripped off as well as our aircon not working at all. Our 2nd room - aircon would work by blowing out air however temp control stated ‘failure’ and wold not heat up so we were cold all night. The beds are only a double and ridiculously uncomfortable. The mattress if not firm but rock solid. The pillows although they look fluffy squash down to virtually flat. Very basic and minimalistic room. For the name, I expected more for my money."
1098,Elizabeth,2024-02-10,"Ideal location for the theatre Excellent location for the train station and the Hippodrome theatre. Nice room,comfy bed and a good breakfast. Staff friendly and helpful."
1099,Elizabeth,2024-02-06,Accommodation was not what I expected from Hilton Good location. Friendly helpful staff Wash basin in room was cracked. Handle for toilet flush was coming away from the wall.
1100,Angela,2024-02-05,Good stay in Bristol Good breakfast and evening nibbles in Recess restaurant. Friendly staff. Not a lot of space in the room.
1101,Jeff,2024-02-05,"Passable Breakfast was excellent Room was very small, not as clean as I would have expected, carpet and curtains dirty. Bed very noisy and therefore uncomfortable as the wooden base creaked every time you moved."
1102,Shannon,2024-02-04,Not worth the money Close to the Center Small bathroom that was damaged in several places. The surrounding area to the hotel was a building site.
1103,John,2024-02-04,"Pleasant  Shower was not working properly, the temperature control was not working properly, either to hot or to cold, could not get the right temperature because it was faulty. Only one big towel and 2 small towels in bathroom, 2 big towels were needed."
1104,Stephen,2024-01-29,Great Location for a weekend in Bristol Fantastic location. Clean comfortable rooms with good shower. Comfortable bed and room was sound proofed. Nothing
1105,David,2024-01-27,"Poor, Breakfast OK. Room extremely cold. Was offered a different room or a radiator. Rather than change room chose the latter bur was then supplied with a fan heater that was a noisy and crude way of heating that could not be left on for long periods."
1106,David,2024-01-14,"Good location, but hotel room only just adequate and in need of refurbishment. Good location, easy access from railway station and easy walk into city centre, friendly reception and restaurant staff. Room was tired, carpet stained, missing paint on skirting board in bedroom. Whilst room was reasonably sized, there was very little space between the bed and the wall on one side yet other side of bed was a large open space."
1107,Amir,2024-01-14,"Tired rooms and bit average. Great location, handy for the station and town. Very basic, tired looking rooms. Main light in the room didn’t work, was only one towel in the bathroom, and a very stained chair in the room. Parking was also £20 where advertised as £16."
1108,James,2024-01-14,"Wouldn’t recommend  Overpriced for what it is, room wasn’t very clean"
1109,Alison,2024-01-13,Fine but nothing special Clean Friendly Staff Rooms were very small and basic. No biscuits on the tea tray was disappointingly stingy. Shower seal was coming off
1110,Suzanne,2024-01-12,Excellent hotel. Wouldn’t stay again because of parking Good position for town centre. Clean rooms. Good breakfast Parking! Had to pay £10 in nearby car park as the 20 odd spaces in hotel were full of builders working nearby. So had to wait until they finished before parking for £20 overnight in hotel car park. The receptionist told me they let them park as they make money from them! Surely customers come first!
1111,Anwen,2024-01-07,"You get what you pay for Location Room wasn't as clean as I'd like, but worn and dated. Apple juice at breakfast was fermented and mouldy"

1113,Denita,2024-01-04,Exceptional Was clean and beautiful The doors
1114,Kate,2024-01-03,Pleasant Location Tv service Floor we was on when it stated in booking ground floor room
1115,Kelly,2024-01-02,"It was a nice hotel but not worth the price. Clean room and easy location to where we needed to be. The breakfast was nice in the morning and the front desk staff were helpful as our dinner booking was cancelled by the hotel. The room was very small for a queen room and the price. Parking I would expect to be better for the £20 you have to pay it’s just Right by a main road with no security? We had a squeaky bed and a fousty smell wafting through the room which we think was from the air vents. The room was tiny and nothing amazing in there besides a fridge so I’m unsure what the extra value of the queen room was for. The staff in the bar in the evening barely spoke the atmosphere was dyer! No music considering it was NYE, we felt like they didn’t want us there."
1116,Katryna,2023-12-30,Disappointing I was really disappointed with the room as it was looking out onto a building site
1117,Stephen,2023-12-28,"Chritmas and Boxing Day City Break. Friendliness and helpfulness of staff. Heating in room did not work however given portable heater in the room which was adequate. TV selection was poor and channel selection software didn't appear to work , very few channels to select which was dissapointing. Bed mattresses also hard which was uncomfortable."
1118,John,2023-12-28,Excellent As above Finding the Hotel
1119,Tracy,2023-12-26,"Was perfect, definitely will stay again. Lovely staff, comfy bed, spotlessly clean and delicious breakfast. Nothing"
1120,Amy,2023-12-21,"Passable Great location, ideally located near the train station and 10/15 minute walk into the center. Rooms decent size and clean. Good selection at breakfast. The hotel has not dealt with my complaint in relation to noise during my stay. We were told a week prior to our stay the restaurant would be closed to a private function. Not an issue as planned to eat in the city but the hotel placed us on floors one and three with no consideration of the noise we would experience from the function until gone midnight both nights. It's a shame as the hotel was perfect for location and somewhere I would like to stay again had they acknowledged our concerns better. It was clean and the bed were comfy, my only concern was the noise from the functions. However I'm reluctant to return due to the poor customer service from the reception staff and management. The hotel had five floors.I think they could have considered putting us higher up to avoid the noise and away from.guests staying for the function as we had a lot of slammed doors and shouting until gone midnight both nights. Also they could have reminders around hotel for guests to be respectful to other guests staying at the hotel. The room also had poor lighting and were quite dark in the bedroom area."
1121,Catherine,2023-12-19,"I will never come back It was close to the train station I was put in a room on the first floor near the front of the hotel and I could hear people chatting while smoking in front of the hotel like they were in my room. The hotel was very noisy. I was then sent to a room on the 5th floor with a leak in the shower and the heater was broken. The heaters in both rooms were very very noisy, the noise was worse than if a car was in the room and in the new room it did not even work. I had to go to the front desk and they gave me a space heater. No heater in the middle of winter is unacceptable for a room at 200 euros a night. Moreover the remote for the TV did not work. Unfortunately, I cannot add the video here to show what it was like. The pictures on booking and the reality in the hotel are very different. The furniture are old and the carpet is very old."
1122,Christakis,2023-12-17,"Exceptional Staff (Maria checked us in) were extremely, professional, courteous and accommodating. 10/10"
1123,Ian,2023-12-11,"Passable  Disappointed that there was no bar or restaurant for either of the nights of our stay due to private functions. Even though we were told about this after we had booked, this is not an acceptable level of service for what we paid."
1124,Ruth,2023-12-10,Awful  To be told at 9.30am 15 minutes after arriving no bar or restaurant available in the evening was appalling as we like to use the hotel facilities in the evening nor was this highlighted when booking this hotel when we come away we don’t want to sit in a cold lobby I will Not book this hotel again as I took this up with reception and they couldn’t care less. And god forbid that I wanted to pay cash for my drink on 2 occasions to be told no it’s card the staff would only take my cash when I explained to them that I didn’t have a card!
1125,Jamie,2023-12-08,Pleasant Good location Rainhead shower needed and not hot enough. King bed was just two twin beds pushed together and tv not working.
1126,Deborah,2023-12-06,So bad that I cancelled a booking for next year. The reception staff were good. Bathroom ok but no stock of loo paper and not replaced until requested. No towels replaced in room. Dirty stained chair. Had to bring my own hangers as not enough for 2 people. Lack of choice of meals on first night due to coach party having buffet. Ended up with a starter. Parking expensive. Drinks in bar restuarant expensive. Setting not very good either. Felt more like a premier inn or travel lodge.
1127,Sarah,2023-12-06,Wish I had never stayed there Breakfast was good TV was not working properly Carparking was £20 for 24hrs not mentioned anywhere could not buy for 12 A simple order for dinner wrong poor quality Carpet had stains on it Water kept going cold in shower poor pressure Fire Alarm went off at 6.55 for just long enough to wake us up and not able to go back to sleep sign downstairs said fire alarm was the following morning at 11am
1128,Woodward,2023-12-06,"The hotel was fine but we have been to Bristol on quite a few occasions and have stayed in better . The breakfast was very nice, but the location was a little far out for us. Allow no one used the shower. It was leaking and by the morning the bathroom floor was wet. Maybe an accident waiting to happen."
1129,Adam,2023-12-06,Exceptional Staff are excellent.
1130,Sean,2023-12-06,Pleasant location next to train station staffing levels were poor with breakfast area looking shabby due to staff not able to keep up with cleaning due to amount of people eating. for a hilton hotel it felt tired inside.
1131,Joshi,2023-12-05,Disappointing The rooms are tired. The AC makes too much noise and the AC instructions sticker does not match the actual controls. Small room.. Not worth £150 that I paid for a night stay. Excellent staff and breakfast. Comfy bed.
1132,Jack,2023-12-05,"Poor  Couldn't control the heating in the room (you were supposed to be able to, but it wasn't working in mine), creakiest bed I've ever slept in, had a 'do not disturb' sign on the door that was ignored by housekeeping."

1134,Lee,2023-12-04,"Disappointing close too the shops, heating was not working so moved us rooms right away with a complimentary drink each was not value for money.. room was bog standard & your budget hotels for 70 odd pounds cheaper are alot nicer"
1135,S,2023-12-03,"Not what I expected Great breakfast... Very noisy from road, hotel corridor and bedrooms either side, so lack of sleep! Paid for hotel parking, then moved my car and someone took my space. Was not refunded for parking as promised"
1136,Mrs,2023-12-03,"Pleasant Some of the staff were professional, but I feel they would benefit from better training, to make the customers feel welcome on they stay. We thought this property was not good value for money. There was only one comfortable seat to relax in in the bar, and that was just inside the door where everyone was going in and out for a smoke. The rooms had no sofa or comfortable chair so all together you couldn't sit and enjoy a drink anywhere. The hair dryer in our room was melted, so I thought unsafe to use. There was no heating in the rooms and no extra blankets, so I was awake most of the night, shivering.."

Staff were not really helpful we arrived very late 11:00 pm and the hotel restaurant was closed, we asked if they could recommend anything they were not helpful. Also I had asked for a quiet and spacious room, they responded by email saying they would facilitate my request however on arrival we were given a horrible room facing the construction site, and first thing in the morning there was a lot of noise, we barely had a decent sleep. We had asked for a late check out and we were told we can only stay extra 30 mins even though the hotel wasn't busy.I was disappointed for the money i paid"

Aircon didn’t work in the room, staff was helpful and got me into another room with working aircon which was more comfortable- but old fashioned dial rather than being able to set the temperature. Noisy near the main road, could do with better sound insulation and bed wasn’t very comfortable or supportive. Just all seemed very old fashioned and not worth the money spent,"

1157,Cath,2023-11-03,"Hot and stuffy room and unprofessional male receptionist let down an otherwise nice hotel. Clean room, good shower, comfy beds The room was so stuffy and sweltering despite it being cool outside in October and the window only opened a tiny amount. The air conditioning was useless and very noisy - we came home a night early as both were recovering from colds so we were already blocked up. The worse part overall was the reaction of the male grey haired receptionist with glasses. On the morning of our second day we decided to go home early so I went to reception only to hand in the room cards and check out. I wasn't expecting any refund and didn't really want to explain anything and we were so tired we just wanted to get home. After making me wait for a few minutes until he served me (unapologetically) while he did some admin from the previous guest, I pleasantly said I just wanted to check out and handed him the cards. He looked at his screen and said ""but you're staying for 2 nights"" - I explained that we weren't feeling good and that the room had been unbearable hot and stuffy so we had had a bad night and just wanted to go home. he replies ""Well, you'll have to pay for the second night"" without making eye contact staring at his computer. I'd already paid for the stay when I checked in and hadn't even mentioned not paying for the second night. I was so taken aback and foggy headed that I just said ""I've already paid"" and he handed me the card of the manager in case we wanted a refund. I was amazed at his response and in hindsight I wish I had been more on the ball. Rather than saying something like, ""Im sorry to hear that"" / ""maybe we can move you to a cooler room or ""did you try the air conditioning? I came away feeling as if we were treated like we were not worthy to be staying there and were trying something on, not like a valued guest at all. This member of staff needs some customer service refresher training, or perhaps a new job where he isn't dealing with customers."
1158,Navy,2023-11-02,"Good VFM room in convenient location Good location beside the train station. Professional staff. The carpets, curtains and upholstery were all a little ""tired"". I'm sure a deep clean would fix it. Hard to do when you're kept busy!"
1159,Carl,2023-10-30,"Great location for train & city centre Breakfast, location, gym, facilities, staff All good except shower control of hot water. Buckets of good pressure hot water but the thermostatic control went from very hot to freezing cold at the slightest touch. Maintenance issue only and did not affect our great stay."
1160,Nigel,2023-10-30,"Good location but pricey Good location, helpful friendly staff. Rooms were clean. The toiletries supplies were good quality and smelled great. Beds were very comfy. Air con wasn't working in both our rooms. There was building work right opposite and they were very noisy from 7am on a Sunday morning. We weren't told about this in advance. Shower was leaking. Rooms were very dated. For some reason a tiny room had two large chairs in it that were just getting in the way."
1161,Suzanne,2023-10-28,No complaints but better hotels in cente for better value Lovely breakfast - nice staff Upgraded room was just average
1162,Martin,2023-10-27,Exceptional Very friendly staff. Lunch was great.
1163,Kayleigh,2023-10-25,Ok but not worth the £140 charge for the night Comfy bed and nice staff This was my first experience in a Hilton hotel and I definitely expected more. I didn’t feel the hotel was worth the price per night. There was stains on the chair and cleaning staff entered the room before the check out time.
1164,Michael,2023-10-23,Not worth £150 poind Room was not worth £150 air con on all nigh anable to turn off room was clean but bed plllows to soft bed noisy breakfast should be included in the price would not stay again parking also should be included Extra pillows and breakfast
1165,Robert,2023-10-22,Exceptional Location suited us.
1166,Alice,2023-10-22,Comfortable and convenient and good preparation for the work I had to do Comfortable and convenient for work in Bristol - only short walk from station and on into centre for the work I was doing. I have been returning to this hotel for the repeat work I have as they were so helpful every time I have stayed.
1167,Michael,2023-10-20,The hotel served the purpose in that it was central. However we felt it was overpriced and in need of updating The location and the breakfast. The staff were friendly and helpful The room and corridors looked tired and shabby. Our room was very small with the bathroom like a caravan size bathroom. The curtains and carpets had stains. No bottled water in the room which we feel should be standard when you are paying the rate we did
1168,Leslie,2023-10-18,It was just Okay. Restaurant and staff were excellent Room had many problems which we addressed to reception. They apologized and offered us a discount on the room. That never happened. We were still charged the full amount that we were quoted. No refund ever issued back to our credit card as promised.
1169,Marrion,2023-10-16,"Uncomfortable never again! Not much Outdated, £20 per night for car parking, awful breakfast, doors not locking properly."
1170,Adam,2023-10-14,Could do better  Sheets on bed were stained with makeup and there was a black mark on the covers. Not what I’d expect
1171,Clare,2023-10-13,Clean comfortable no-frills friendly & efficient Convenient to Temple Meads station & easy walk to restaurants Suited the purpose very well
1172,Gina,2023-10-12,Exceptional Excellent 5mins away from Temple Meads train station.
1173,Andrew,2023-10-10,Overpriced and unsatisfactory best thing about the stay was leaving after checkout. Breakfast! The hotel was surrounded by road closures and a building site. Open the room curtain and builders could look in. Access to the car park was limited due to road closures. The hotel should have arranged temporary direction signage’s.
1174,Stephen,2023-10-10,"Great location, very friendly staff Location, cleanliness, staff"

1177,Valerie,2023-10-10,"Exceptional Within walking distance of train station but also very close to the city centre, restaurants and bars. The hotel was very comfortable. I could read the labels on the toiletries in the shower without my glasses plus the shower head actually sprayed in the right direction. The breakfast catered for all tastes. Nothing"
1178,Grzegorz,2023-10-09,"Exceptional Hilton Garden Inn in Bristol is a fantastic price-quality-location combination. Very friendly staff, great breakfasts, clean rooms, close to the railway station and airport bus, fitness, beautiful park just opposite to the hotel... I will come back there for sure. The restaurant and room service could operate longer. Last order at 9:30pm is a little bit too early as for me."
1179,Shirley,2023-10-09,"Great hotel. Had a fantastic time there All staff was very friendly, helpful. Food was excellent. Room was clean and great size. Could not fault anything in the hotel. Fantastic location. Less then 10min from train station and Cabot’s shopping centre. Can’t find fault with anything."

1183,Ian,2023-10-05,Great location. Lovely room. Clean and great staff Road closures but not the hotels fault
1184,Richard,2023-10-02,Expensive for very basic facilities The location was good for us For a Hilton it was very basic. A bottle of water in the room would be a good thing for them to do.

1194,Terry,2023-09-20,Exceptional Everything . Nothing
1195,Jane,2023-09-19,"Good location for train station, lovely staff. Very nice, helpful staff. Comfortable room. Quite hard to find way into hotel car park as lots of building work in the area and not well signposted."
1196,Sarah,2023-09-18,"HOT but not in a good way! Was able to leave bags at reception as we arrived before check-in. Staff courteous and helpful. Air conditioning not working in both rooms on one of the hottest days of year, offered us a fan & cold drinks. Had to move hotels as the heat was so unbearable, picked this hotel because of the Hilton name so really disappointed with the standard of room."
1197,Michael,2023-09-17,"Pleasant Location brilliant, food and bar superb, clean hotel, friendly, helpful staff. Outdated, well used room, no USB charger socket."
1198,Isabelle,2023-09-16,"Passable Friendly staff 1)Being charged £20 for parking. The initial email received a few minutes after booking said £16, I contacted the hotel to ask about blue badge parking because my friend has mobility issues. Was told they have 3 but it is on a first come first served basis. (and incidently, those three spaces are quite far from the entrance/reception area - far from ideal. ) 2) Difficult to find. The hotel is easy to see from Temple Way, but finding the entrance to the car park/hotel entrance was difficult. It is poorly signposted and a bit of a nightmare. 3) The hotel accommodation is average. We booked a room with a king-size bed and there was very little room to move around the bed, the room felt very small. The room description mentions an ergodynamic chair, which was the only chair in the room and quite uncomfortable.. The furniture hasn't been updated for a while. Bed side sockets could be more accessible. Don't be deceived by the ""Hilton"" name, this feels like an inferior budget hotel, and what you save on the so called free breakfadt in the room description is taken off you in parking fees."
1199,Matthew,2023-09-15,"Very unsatisfactory - issues with rooms being over booked Not a lot Room size and ground floor position by restaurant toilets, poor air conditioning"
1200,Patricia,2023-09-11,Excellent stay with brilliant location to City and Train Station Staff went out of their way to be helpful especially with food intolerances Nothing to add
1201,Kim,2023-09-10,Pleasant Comfy beds Expensive for what you get!
1202,Keeli,2023-09-10,"Ok for a night or so. Room very very clean. Staff helpful and happy. Air con amazing Breakfast - Very limited choice, not much space for the dining. Expensive for what is on offer. Evening - 45min wait for a toasted Sandwich, which was very poor quality and cold."
1203,Carol,2023-09-10,"If we travel to Bristol in the future this will definately be our hotel of choice. We liked everything about the hotel. The staff were excellent, couldn't be more friendly and helpful. The whole hotel was immaculate from the reception, dining room and our room. Nothing, you can't beat perfection!"
1204,Melanie,2023-09-06,"Great hotel, superb central location. Great location Car park awkward to get to due to building work and road closures. Would be handy to have updated directions whilst it’s ongoing."
1205,Oliver,2023-09-05,Pleasant Location Cleanliness of rooms
1206,Simon,2023-09-01,"Ok for a 3 star hotel definitely not acceptable for Hilton Easy access Dated, poor Wi-Fi, not a great tv selection Cut hand on office chair in room that had seen better days. Sink cracked. Can not see TV from desk .."
1207,Debbie,2023-08-31,"Overpriced Disappointment Location was perfect for us. Room size was adequate and well equipped with fridge and safe. Room cleanliness left a lot to be desired. There were splashs of something all over the wall next to the mirror, the quilt cover on one bed was stained and the bathroom fixtures were in disrepair and had rusted to a degree. I expected a better breakfast selection given the star rating of this hotel, and the standard of the cooked items on offer was sub standard at best. I expected better quality for the room rate I paid and I wouldn't recommend the Hilton chain."
1208,Roberta,2023-08-31,Exceptional Very nice hotel. Excellent facilities and kind personnel. The breakfast was very good. I highly recommend it.
1209,Christine,2023-08-30,Comfortable and safe Friendly staff comfortable bed Great breakfast with lots of choices And on site parking Stains on the bedroom carpet
1210,Helen,2023-08-29,"Lovely staff, great choice of a buffet breakfast rooms could do with being a little more different. Central to all of the surrounding area, shops, bars . The rooms were pretty much the same, I firstly booked the queen room with park view, I was offered an upgrade which seemed good to a king room, when we arrived we were given our room to fines it was a twin double, the reception staff were lovely and changed us to the room I had upgraded to, to find we were overlooking the main road and the only difference I could see was the size of the bed, the t.v had no menu as to what was on which can be annoying."
1211,Jessica,2023-08-29,This is by no means a 4 star hotel Breakfast was por The room was filthy.. dinner was a pizza 15.00 which was absolutely awful. Very dated hotel fixtures were hanging off..
1212,Malgorzata,2023-08-29,"Worth it! Very much liked the fact of breakfast till 11. That is a great thing, especially when you stay up late the other night discovering the city. Clean room and always helpful staff Nothing I didn't like. Just missed vegetables like tomato or cucumber at breakfast. But that wouldn't lower my opinion about this hotel."
1213,Gerard,2023-08-29,Overall a good experience The location and cleanliness Thought the bar was over priced and the car park
1214,Dawn,2023-08-29,Exceptional Staff friendly helpful room really good. Clean tidy I think that the catering team could provide at least 2 vegetables for breakfast so mushrooms and tomatoes not one or the other. Also a list of things on offer so poached eggs vegan sausages etc we had to ask. Prunes would be a welcomed addition to the fresh fruit range. Double checking room to make sure that the room service menu is actually in there.Ours was not.A map of Bristol in the room or on offer at reception would be great as well. And where was the Gideon bible ?????
1215,Richard,2023-08-28,"Great value for money, convenient for public transport and exceeded my expectations in every way. I was pleasantly surprised with everything about the hotel. i chose it based on price and location, which was perfect as was using public transport for a week of visiting family and friends. I have travelled a fair bit during the past year and hotel prices have been ludicrously high in most places. Everything, the staff, the comfortable bed, soundproofing from outside noise, breakfast, etc,etc. made my stay really enjoyable at a reasonable price. I was staying alone so maybe the room I had may be small for 2 people, but I would still recommend booking here. No criticism."
1216,Zena,2023-08-28,In need of a revamp Central location within walking distance of Bristol Temple Meads railway station. Tiered and dated décor that need a comprehensive refresh.

Shower freezing cold, informed reception, had to repeat my complaint as lady on reception never understood my complaint. I thought Peter on reception , may of intervened. He's usually courteous and professional when I have stayed previously"

1221,Susan,2023-08-24,A little disappointing. Breakfast & location were good. Room looked nice. The bed was too firm & therefore uncomfortable. I couldn't get any hot water from the shower no matter how much I tried.

1223,Susan,2023-08-24,"Not good and wouldn’t return… The staff are very friendly and welcoming but that’s where it stops… The rooms are way too small, smallest bathrooms I have ever seen.. My husband is disabled and wheelchair just went through the door and then had to be folded as no room… We were offered a disabled room which didn’t seem much bigger but bed was far too small… Aircon didn’t work so we had to leave window open and then too noisy…pillows are too soft….."

1226,Paul,2023-08-21,"Very poor  The room was above the back entrance and right at the top of the first floor, the noise levels from both entrances was awfully loud meaning it kept me up all night."
1227,Ian,2023-08-21,Not good and a waste of money Breakfast was good everything else was bad The room was tiny the view was at scaffolding the bed sheets were dirty the lifts were smelling the air on was awful
1228,Natasha,2023-08-18,Would stay but wouldn't use the restaurant again Everything was amazing and staff were very friendly We had dinner in the restaurant... I had a starter and a main my partner only had main. We had 1 drink each and water.. we went to pay and order two beers to take to our room and the bill came to over £70+ which was a shock but we paid it as we didn't want to cause a fuss but that was a lot for what we ordered.
1229,Leon,2023-08-18,"Great today at a great price, with a fantastic breakfast The best breakfast I’ve ever had in a hotel at this price"
1230,Katie,2023-08-18,"Disappointed with response from hotel over situation. Would never stay there again. Close to train station Bed bugs! I got eaten alive, over 30 bites. Told hotel, not heard anything back from them apart from acknowledging my complaint. Room 236 ….avoid!!!! Thank you for responding, but I do not believe no bed bugs were found. How come I was fine when I came into the hotel room and then had over 30 bites on my arms, legs and back from the side that i slept on when I left the next day?"
1231,Steven,2023-08-17,Poor no thank you Bristol Hilton The room was comfortable Aircon did not work 1. Parking not told until booking made that parking was £20 a day! I tried to cancel as we had travelled in 2 cars £40 as a guest on room that cost £82. 2. Roadworks were everywhere at the Hotel no message to inform us that all entrances were closed around hotel. Easy to warn customers in advance! 3. At breakfast my partner was rudely approached that we didn’t have breakfast on our booking which was totally incorrect! So I was made to back to room to bring my phone and show proof of the breakfast! Staff should know!! Aircon I’m room was not working at all and when approached next day the staff said we could have got a fan at night. Ut that’s not cool air that’s just blowing warm air around. Overall poor

1242,Marion,2023-08-04,Poor  The rooms are very out of date and not worth the money
1243,Gam,2023-08-04,"Had a pleasant stay and would definitely stay there if we visit Bristol again. Located at a very convenient and quite part of the town. Very comfortable room with plenty of space and clean. Very nice restaurant and bar, foods were really good. Breakfast was plentiful and the good thing is that breakfast was laid out in different part ie. main breakfast in one corner, pastries drinks & coffee in other area so it avoided crowding in one place everyone queuing in most of the other hotels. Couple bottles of mineral water in room would have been nice."

1245,Duncan,2023-08-03,"Not great. The young lad behind the bar on Saturday 29th July was very helpful, as was the girl organising the breakfasts on Sunday morning. Apart from the two staff above, we found the staff unhelpful and surly, even being ignored as we checked out on the Sunday."
1246,Jane,2023-08-03,"Great hotel for the price Staff were friendly. Hotel was smart and clean (and reception area smelt nice). Small room and double bed were comfortable. Limited parking, so best to have a Plan B in case car park is full. Overall, a great hotel for the price."

1249,Steve,2023-07-30,"Would consider other options in future Location with parking. Staff wonderful, restaurant and menu choice very nice. Rooms becoming dated.

The breakfast was very nice, the staff all very friendly and polite. very handy for the city centre. i liked the provision of a fridge empty toiletry bottles, broken pump on toiletry bottle, Showerhead was full of limescale. Quite a small room and even smaller bathroom this considering i was 'upgraded' to a King room, too small, and once the luggage bags where in, no room to pass the bed. When i booked i was offered a city view, i actually received a main road and a large overgrown tree view it was very very noisy all throughout the night. The desk chair provided was heavily stained, no complimentary biscuits with the coffee and tea. and finally i thought the charge of £20 to park my car, as a guest, on site was a little extortionate."

I had asked for some poached eggs but had to wait 20 mins (chef was busy frying eggs). Air con in my room was very loud and so I had a sleepless night. Room was generally grubby with broken panels, missing bits under the sink etc. It just felt cheap (dare I say, nasty) and old. No drinking water in the room.

Room spacious enough for a 2-night stay, and spotlessly clean. Bar and restaurant area bright and open. Nice little outside terrace for evening drinks. Great breakfast.

1277,Jamie,2023-06-30,Terrible Nothing No hot water Hairdryer broke 1 towel Breakfast was freezing cold Bed was uncomfortable
1278,Jacob,2023-06-28,I won't be staying again Good area No air-condition was working so it was very hot
1279,Malika,2023-06-27,"Good place to stay Room, location, breakfast were all good. Invoicing. I have spoken and written twice to the hotel about the double charging of breakfasts. Some corrections were made. I was informed upon arrival that booking the breakfast would be cheaper if booked the previous day. Although, staying alone at the hotel, my son joined me for the breakfast on 29 May and I paid for two breakfasts on 28 May. On 30 May, I had breakfast alone and paid for it on 29 May, but was charged for two full breakfasts. I am still waiting for their refund."
1280,Ann,2023-06-26,"The Premier Inn up the road does a much better breakfast and the beds are just as comfortable Location, and staff were friendly The breakfast was the worst I've ever had in a Hilton Hotel. Very limited choice, the hot dishes were unappetising to look at, so I didn't even try one. Poor quality and selection of breads. The pastries looked dry and straight out of a commercial freezer and the muffins were tiny and dry."
1281,Kerry,2023-06-26,"Avoid if you can find better value with allocated parking. Clean, good sized bed. Convenient lift. Convenient bar facility. Kettle/drinks/furniture/tv provided. Nice clean towels. Very small bathroom. Noisy air conditioner with no control for on/off. Very poor parking. Disabled at far end of car park. Once fee paid, no guarantee of space and no refund policy. Too keen to charge fee and had to find out for ourselves that there was an overspill car park, which was free! Stayed 2 nights but coffee/tea not refilled. Room not cleaned/no bins emptied."

1285,Samantha,2023-06-20,"Our favourite hotel in Bristol! The perfect hotel in Bristol in terms of facilities, cleanliness and location. We stay here every year and wouldn’t go anywhere else, the hotel has everything we need and the staff are so so friendly every time we have visited. We can’t wait to come back next year!"

1288,Karolien,2023-06-18,"Passable Staff were amazing. It was a very hot day. The air conditioning in one of our rooms didn't work and they went out of their way to accomodate us, changed the teenagers to another room on the same floor. A hot day with a cool night, but very small windows. Unable to let any fresh air in. Air conditioning very noisy. No USB charging points in the room."
1289,Richard,2023-06-16,"If you are happy to stay in a room that resembles a hostel then stay here. Staff were friendly and walking distance to train station. -Rooms decor looks like its from the 70s - Dustiest room ive ever stayed in. Each morning i woke up my eyes were stinging, nose iching and lungs very irritated. I don't have allergies so it must have been heavy with dust. - Bed was very uncomfortable and it smelt musty and old. - Aircon wasn't cold. - Room was tiny - I had 2 terrible nights of very broken sleep. - Im surprised the Hilton would put their name on this hotel to be honest."
1290,Gordon,2023-06-15,I thought Hilton Garden Inn very comfortable and in a convenient location. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hygiene was of a very high standard. The food was very good. I cannot think of anything I did not like.
1291,Alice,2023-06-11,Comfortable and convenient - set me up for the days work ahead Very convenient for the work I was doing in Bristol and ofr zooming into meetings the night before. Friendly staff and comfortable bed.
1292,Jiadi,2023-06-06,"Disappointing Staff were kind. There was someone left their opened toothbrush with toothpaste on the shower door! I can't imagine how it would left there. I was too tired to ask for changing room and only stayed for a night, in all I don't recommend this place."
1293,Sebastian,2023-06-05,"Pleasant Staff were great, location was perfect and breakfast was decent The bathroom in my room wasn't very clean. The shower especially and around the sink. The walls and ceiling seemed to have mould or damp that wasn't very pleasant."

1298,Maxine,2023-06-03,"Room and restaurant service fine. Male Receptionist in wrong job!  We checked to see if there were electric charging points. When we got there the 3 points were occupied by non-electric cars which remained for our entire 20 hour stay. There is no system for checking number plates, so they couldn’t be contacted. When my husband politely complained, the (male) receptionist told him he was being aggressive!! We had huge difficulties in finding the hotel entrance as there are road works and no signage. The receptionist on duty when we arrived (Bailey) was very apologetic and upgraded our room."

The evening staff almost fell over themselves to please us.and we had a lovely welcome on our arrival. I found the bed was a bit high so had to take a run and jump to get up there,much to the delight of my granddaughter.we loved our room. The hotel is quite a walk into shopping area,which would be ok if I didn’t have a painful back,not anything to do with the hotel of course, but if I came again I would choose somewhercloser to town. The tea in the room was organic , and not much milk etc.but the wonderful evening staff found me some English tea and supplied milk. But these were just niggles from someone my age."

Exceptionally nice. I can’t begin to describe how nice. Being American, I wished there was better coffee in the room, but the coffee downstairs in the restaurant was good, so this is a minor detail."
1307,Hakan,2023-05-29,Moderate Location is very central to train station and city center Bed and pillows were so soft that i couldn't sleep well. Also there needs to be at least free water bottle per day while accommodating.

1310,Rachel,2023-05-29,Good clean hotel. Clean and smart looking - staff were very nice Location was a bit out of town in an area which felt a bit like an office area but not far to walk to the main areas. Room was rather bland and small - felt very expensive for what it was. We were able to park at the hotel.
1311,Clara,2023-05-28,"good location but poor facilities, too expensive for what it is very close to the temple meads station carpet and furnitures were dirty.

I received a room with stains on the wall, shower and carpet. The bed was not so comfy. The roomkey was getting demagnetisatized all the time. I had to reactivate it on a daily at least 3 times a day. no water available in the room except from tap water. I had to pay 4,56 euro for two bottles of 0,5cl water which is ridiculous."

1322,Neil,2023-05-06,"as above. We are just a number not human beings location bland, no luxuries in the room, bed was hard. Just another beige place to stay, no character, no personal service, customers just a number. Classic case of post Brexit Post Covid cost cutting hotel."
1323,Mark,2023-05-05,Exceptional I like the facilities the people the location and the cleanliness of the building The parking situation. Apparently they have 175 rooms and about 50 parking spaces which if it's available you can pay $20 a day for parking.. however that does not guarantee you a parking spot when you come back to the parking lot.. I did get reimbursed for my charges on parking but it just was frustrating coming back at night and there's no parking spaces and then you got to go out at night trying to find one on the street somewhere where you don't get a ticket

1331,Madeline,2023-04-23,Passable The location is good - city centre so within walking distance to most of city. Foyer and bar are nice and staff were friendly. The rooms were very basic and there was a stain on one of the towels. Also £20 per night for parking on-site is ridiculous.

1334,Sarah,2023-04-18,not bad restaurant/bar staff shower door fitted incorrectly so couldn’t get in shower! had to shower with door wide open and water went everywhere
1335,Andrew,2023-04-18,"Building Site The reception staff were very welcoming on our arrival and gave great information on various sites in Bristol. Where do I start? I booked a room with a city view and despite 75% of the Hotel having this I was given a room facing a building site and awoke to find 3 builders directly opposite my window hammering scaffolding together! The mattress was too hars and the pilliwa had no support whatsoever leading to a night of very patchy sleep. Breakfast was barely lukewarm and the bacon was almost raw. So disappointing to have paid for something that was not delivered. Some kind of recompense is definitely in order, I would never use Hilton again!"
1336,Sarah,2023-04-16,"perfect .,Peter on reception was very helpful close to everything. great for a nights stay"
1337,Alice,2023-04-15,Comfortable and reliable Comfortable and convenient for the work I was doing in Bristol. I was well rested and ready to do a good job. Found the chair in the room difficult to keep at the right height for use of the desk area
1338,John,2023-04-15,excellent location nothing
1339,Ask,2023-04-13,Value for money - below standard. Location is great. Staff were fairly helpful especially Ms. Bailey. Male staff could do with a bit of CS retraining. The bed was awful. I could feel the springs. TV screen I believe is quite old ( remote is over used) and so pretty poor on brightness (remote worn out so cannot really adjust brightness). Why are there so much storage spaces - room feels very crammed. Carpets old - perhaps a thorough cleaning is in order. Sorry for the negative feedback. Remember this is Hilton! Expectations are high as the room rates are also high.
1340,Michael,2023-04-11,"Weekend show and stay Very clean smart and friendly hotel, excellent breakfast , 10 out of 10 Nothing"
1341,Matthew,2023-04-10,Fine for the brief time I was there Staff were friendly and welcoming Coffee on offer at breakfast was not pleasant. Also I booked a double and was changed to a twin
1342,Stephen,2023-04-09,Wish I'd stayed at the Premier Inn instead. Location was ok Comedy shower with inwards opening door so you can't get in and close it! Design probably necessitated by too small bathroom. Room seemed poorly prepared. Needed a good hoovering. Tea and coffee facilities not replenished and cups and spoons needed a wash. Bed very creaky and hard.
1343,Dudley,2023-04-08,very professional very comfortable. Breakfast was absolutely amazing and the shower was divine. shower was absolutely amazing and the bed was extremely comfortable I believe there wasn’t anything I dislike at this place
1344,Richard,2023-04-07,Pleasant  We were not advised that access to the hotel by car was a nightmare due to a combination of a need to find a way to the back of the hotel/car park and the extensive building works taking place in the area. Also a room in a 4 star hotel should provide a spare and more than two breakfast tea sachets - along with others.
1345,Amanda,2023-04-06,"Exceptional From the moment we walked in the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the reception staff, we stayed for 2 nights and our room was on floor 5, it was very clean, tea and coffee provided, a hairdryer, iron & ironing board, towels, shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, the beds were so comfy and the room was quite. We had breakfast, which you can have full breakfast, continental, fruit, waffles, tea coffee, juices. Hotel is close to shops pubs restaurants, about 15 minute walk through temple park (opposite hotel )then turn right up to Bristol Bridge, reception will give you a map and show you. We will definitely recommend and would stay again. For us there was nothing to dislike."

1348,Gemma,2023-04-01,"It was somewhere to put our head down but wouldn’t recommend or come back. Staff were pleasant and location was easy to find. The restaurant area was modern and looked well presented. The rooms were extremely plain, the cream carpets were stained and looked dirty. The bed was the worst thing of all. It was extremely uncomfortable, hard and noisy when moving in bed. The noise would wake me/partner up every time I tossed and turned. The parking cost was extremely expensive too."
1349,Jemma,2023-03-30,"Pleasant basic, good location, the bed was very noisy."

1352,Luis,2023-03-27,Exceptional The staff is simply amazing.
1353,Ian,2023-03-27,"Pleasant friendly staff, breakfast felt like we were in a Travelodge which was shame for an upgraded room it felt like a standard room The breakfast wasn't what we expected especially for a Hilton hotel"
1354,Matthew,2023-03-27,"A far cry from what I expected from the 'Hilton' brand. I was compensated, with a free meal, for the various mistakes made by the hotel reception staff. When I arrived, I was told my booking did not include breakfast (which I had booked). Desiring breakfast, I was asked to pay there and then. Fine. But the card machine was broken. So I paid in cash and was told it would be taken off may bill when I checked out. When I ate in the restaurant that evening with my colleague, for which we asked to be billed separately, they billed us incorrectly - the billed my colleague for everything. So we had to pend 10 minutes sorting this out on checkout next morning. Also during checkout, I was told (by a different staff member) that I had overpaid for breakfast because my original booking did in fact include breakfast. Again this cost about 5 minutes of checkout time. In all, the reception experience was really dire. Nobody seemed to know what they were doing ir why mistakes had been made. As I said, this was helped by the removal of charge for my evening meal. However, my morning at the Hilton had already been tarnished by a rude breakfast chef. Still tired, I stood at the counter playing some hot items on my plate, when out of nowhere I was barred at by the chef for not putting the bacon tongs on a special resting plate in front of the tray. I had in fact picked up the tongs from where I;d left them, in the tray. I was taken aback by this rudeness - how are guests supposed to know this detail? the chef was doing nothing else than watch people do this over again. He could have replaced the tongs himself, or at least said 'good morning' first and perhaps 'sorry, sir, would you mind leaving the tongs on the plate in front"". When I made it clear that I was put out by his conduct, he started arguing with me, about how I should do what I was told. Really ridiculous. It raised stress levels that I really didn't need to be raised and is so easily avoidable. In short, the staff experience during my stay was pretty poor - either through basic incompetence or rudeness."
1355,Craig,2023-03-20,Great location and amazing staff location is excellent nothing
1356,Vicky,2023-03-20,A very nice and relaxing stay. The staff were great and showed care and professionalism when approaching my sisters condition (coeliac). I was made to feel comfortable and relaxed. The food was very good and was served in good time. The room was lovely and we didn't hear any outdoor noise. There was no information in the room about the time of breakfast or if food was available to order to the room.
1357,Liz,2023-03-19,"Very disappointed would not stay here again  Towels that were yellow and smelt stale and musty. Most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in , wooden frame creaked with every movement. Shower temperature could not be controlled"
1358,Serge,2023-03-17,"Passable  No hand soap at basin, only 2 sheets of kleenex, no bags for sanitary towels (though not reqd. male). Not noticed on arrival 'cos hidden by curtain, window open all night, hence cold, and air con trying to maintain temp ran all the time! Mentioned to reception."
1359,Iain,2023-03-13,"Good location, friendly staff, but the room had some basic problems. Great location near the train station, really friendly staff, easy check-in. No blankets or topsheet (in winter), the desk drawer was broken, and the shower door was a struggle to close. Nothing big, but it just felt a bit substandard."
1360,Daryl,2023-03-13,Disappointing Location was OK. Breakfast was great Room was small very tired Heating didn't work No tissues or bottled water
1361,Laura,2023-03-13,"Uncomfortable beds and too hot Good location with easy access to many attractions. There was less traffic noise than I was expecting. The man on the front desk was a bit snippy, if I'm honest. Yes we checked in 20 minutes early but he could have dropped the attitude. The rooms were far too hot and the bed was uncomfortable. The showerhead holder was held together with glue and wasn't secure, so kept falling on me. Overall, a very average hotel."
1362,Dave,2023-03-13,Disappointing Comfy bed Hot water Cleaners being loud talking Hoovers running in the hall ways from 9 am
1363,Sarah,2023-03-13,Not as good as we were expecting Breakfast was fantastic! The check in staff were really friendly and helpful The room was quite small and dated. Patches of mould in the bathroom. No hand wash

1365,Tim,2023-03-05,"Pleasant stay, good location, helpful staff. Staff were very helpful and polite when we discovered a problem with our original room - bad odour. Underlying mechanical noise in the room."
1366,Penny,2023-03-05,"Disappointing The breakfast was good quality and good value. The room was basic, the fridge wasn't switched on. We could not get it to work even though it was plugged in. There were no teaspoons to stir you coffer or tea.. it was chilly in the room and the warm air conditioning did not work. Apart from that the bed was comfy 😌"
1367,Bryce,2023-03-02,"Perfect hotel for a weekend city break Staff were very friendly and welcoming . Hotel was well managed , spotlessly clean and fresh . Substantial buffet breakfast included in my choice of booking. I think for some it would be to far out from the centre of Bristol for visitors who cannot walk great distances. On the plus side , close to transport links. Distance wasn’t a huge issue for me ."
1368,Jason,2023-03-01,It was ok  Very cold in room Thin duvet No additional bedding Air con VERY NOISEY
1369,Nigel,2023-02-27,Absolutely fantastic Brilliant
1370,05awhitehouse,2023-02-23,I wouldn't stay again. Very disappointed The breakfast and their fragrance in the reception £187 and the heater didn't work in the room. I was honestly shocked. A gas radiator had to be wheeled in. Beds were really uncomfortable too. I've had much better stays in a hostel. I'd recommend the ibis or holiday inn express nearby instead for the Cost difference.
1371,Lauren,2023-02-22,"Poor  uncomfortable HARD beds, cold room, heating sounded like an aeroplane taking off constantly so had to switch off. expensive stay for one night with poor facilities. very dated rooms."
1372,Donna,2023-02-21,it done the job but for a Hilton very poor the location was ok and wen u walked into the reception it smelt lovely the rooms was like a shoe box and wen the heating went on it was like a generator in the bedroom and for a Hilton it was very poor
1373,Sandra,2023-02-14,very enjoyable it was central located. very good position
1374,Lee,2023-02-14,"Stay Elsewhere Located in the centre of Bristol, which met my needs as i had a meeting nearby. First of all don't be taken in by booking.com offering a free upgrade, as all the rooms are exactly the same, and the bathrooms are tiny. The location of the hotel is decent, but trying to get access to it was a nightmare, with the one way system, roads closed and excessive building work nearby. The hotel itself was more like a Travelodge style, and something you don't really relate to, with the Hilton brand name. And the cleaners need to have a word with themselves, as the bin in the bathroom was full of used sanitary products, which i presume was left by the previous occupant, and when i informed reception, all they said was ""sorry about that"" and wasn't interested in the least. The breakfast wasn't really for me, as I'm not a fan of buffet style breakfasts."
1375,Paul,2023-02-13,"Nice hotel but felt a bit disappointed with the experience overall. I wouldn’t rush back. The hotel is well located and smartly decorated. The additional charge of £20 for parking for 24 hours was a bit excessive. We had to wait a fair amount of time to check in, as there were only two members of staff on the desk. The room we stayed in was decorated nicely and smart at first glance, but after spending some time in there, I noticed quite a few stains all over the carpet and a big stain on the curtains. Breakfast was another additional charge, which we had to wait another ten minutes for a table and the food was pretty standard."
1376,Paul,2023-02-12,"not a bad stay but wouldn't rush back. location was good for local destinations. also breakfast was great value. The rooms are small, The televisions are out dated as only really 5 channels. So the rooms look tired and could do with modernizing."
1377,Michelle,2023-02-08,"convenient close to train station and centre have stayed before and been very happy with room but this room was not nice. walls stained and dirty, paint chipped from skirting and walls. room looked uncared for."

1382,Timothy,2023-01-19,freezing ! location it was freezing in my room. the hotel provided and extra plug in radiator but it wasn’t powerful enough to heat the room. Hilton hotels vary so much in quality - this hotel is in desperate need of an update… especially the air con / heating situation.
1383,Sharon,2023-01-17,"hotel perfect close to the venue Restaurant quite expensive, quality not great"
1384,Yvonne,2023-01-16,"Excellent short stay Reception staff, cleanliness, facilities, breakfast..all excellent 👏 Paying £16 for parking"
1385,Smokybarnable,2023-01-07,More like two star hotel The breakfast was quite good. Many different options to choose from. Pretty short walk from train station. For a four star hotel this felt more like a two star. Really old and outdated tired room. Air conditioning difficult to operate. Very noisy street below our room. Overpriced and not cozy.
1386,Michelle,2023-01-07,disappointed because it was cold in the property clean it was very cold
1387,Justin,2023-01-05,Rubbish Location ok The bathroom was dirty and stafff rude and Iv rang to complain not a phone call back very rude I call it and if I don’t hear from anyone one I will put the photos of the bathroom up for other to see
1388,Von,2023-01-03,"Dispute the minute and insignificant difficulties we experienced during our stay, this was more than made up for by the The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. They assisted with advice on local attractions, with calling taxi services, and with extra assistance when needed. Perfect customer service. Everything was very clean with essentials being catered for e.g. shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer. As a wheelchair user, I was very impressed that the hotel had the initiative to use sensor rather than pedal bins in their disabled toilets (this is a bugbear of mine) ❤️ I am a wheelchair user. Although an accessible room was made available; the inside was furnished with carpet, making movement within the room more energy consuming; also there was a lip on the door frame, making it difficult to enter the room (chair tipping and opening a fire door is hard); and the initial room we were directed to had electrical issues (no plugs working)."
1389,Kokila,2022-12-31,"Exceptional The short footpath from the back access to the Knights Templar Church ruins. Beautiful and fascinating Medieval structure, the preserved exterior of it. Everything else except... Air con noisy in room. Shower was cool/cold."
1390,Fani,2022-12-30,"Very pleasant and relaxing stay! Very polite and attentive staff, elegant decor, style and comfort N/A!"
1391,Nigel,2022-12-29,Pleasant Hotel is well placed and well appointed with comfortable rooms. During my stay there was an issue with water supply resulting in no hot water and while I realise this was not caused by the hotel I was only offered an explanation by staff when asking specifically about the problem and there was no apology for the disruption. Quality of the breakfast was poor on the occasion I stayed.
1392,David,2022-12-21,"not value for money, short staffed.  room not serviced, furniture broken, overcharged, cold plates breakfast. what's to like!!"
1393,Jasmine,2022-12-21,"Rooms need more care and attention. Staff amazing. Good location, good breakfast and helpful staff. Manager was very helpful and friendly thank you :) The hotel room didn’t lock at all there was no need for a room card…. so please check before you stay, we only found out once we returned from an outing in which we left our belongings in the room. There was also food left in the fridge."

1402,Paul,2022-12-03,"Disappointed very nice hotel in good position restaurant was closed due to Christmas parties, no prior warning of this given. we were offered room service, which we ordered. food was great but had to sit on the bed to eat as no table, so was uncomfortable. no housekeeping done the following day so dirty dishes, wet towels and no tea making facilities replenished. when my husband spoke with receptionist to ask for clean towels for next day sadly no apologies given just oh it’s not been done! a very nice cleaning lady hastily brought fresh towels and took tray of plates that had sat in our room all day with remaining leftovers, just relieved that we didn’t order fish. All in all a very disappointing experience"
1403,Kamaljit,2022-12-02,Basic but clean Pleasant and friendly staff. Hotel is basic but clean. Toiletries weren't good and smelt awful. Decor is basic and needs updating. Some problem with water coming from tap and shower for a period in the morning. It was just a trickle.
1404,Phil,2022-12-02,"Passable  Blocked toilet, had to move room"
1405,Amanda,2022-12-02,"disappointing , bad communication with staff and the lack of notice about the restaurant not being available. then havi central location staff attitude, being woken at 5am with the delivery of the room service bill. no use of restaurant."
1406,Mariana,2022-11-30,Too expensive for the quality. Location Too expensive for the quality.
1407,Neil,2022-11-27,"Hilton - certainly needs to up there game location the check in was so rushed (very busy) no information on WiFi - no info on breakfast times or where to - room was comfortable, pillows were awful. has also planned to eat at the hotel. to be told on check - restaurant was shut - due to a party / wasn’t pre-In formed - so had to go out in the pouring for food, as room service would have been awful in a tiny room - very disappointed"
1408,Pea,2022-11-27,"ok for one night work trip, Near to the office. friendly and helpful staff. Very basic facilities, food was average."
1409,Angharad,2022-11-26,Exceptional The lady at reception was kind and helped us with our parking and informed us about early check in through Hilton Honours.
1410,Morey,2022-11-26,Passable  Not paid parking
1411,Sally,2022-11-21,"lovely staff, comfortable rooms clean, comfortable and a stunning garden out the back door. staff are super friendly, is walkable to get to centre. bus stop out the front door for longer trips and temple meads very close, 6 minute walk! expensive for a single night stay when it’s not right in the centre. on a main road and not much directly around building."
1412,James,2022-11-20,"average hotel, better and cleaner options available parking and location ok ish. stayed in better hotels dust in the vent over the shower, should have been cleaned and one ruber foot missing from the toilet seat. and every time we walked in and out past reception they never acknowledged us. not what you expect from a Hilton. bed very creaky too"
1413,Mark,2022-11-20,Exceptional Great hotel. Brilliant location for all that Bristol has to offer. Nothing. Great experience.

1418,Natasha,2022-11-09,"Pleasant Staff were lovely, room was clean. The mattress was very firm so much so that it was really uncomfortable for both myself and my mother. We also couldn't switch the aircon off which meant that it would get really warm or freezing during the night."
1419,Dan,2022-11-09,an excellent weekend in an excellent hotel and city. good walking distance to all parts of the city
1420,Yvonne,2022-11-06,"Fantastic hotel experience Fantastic hotel, wonderfully friendly and helpful reception staff. Nothing, excellent all round, Will absolutely stay again"
1421,Michael,2022-11-06,Staff were nice but pretty poor in not cleaning the room properly before we arrived. location was good and facilities and amenities were good Room wasn’t serviced so ran out of toilet paper and coffee. There were leftover takeaways in the fridge from what I assume was from guests before us. There was an empty toilet roll that wasn’t cleared away when we arrived.
1422,Imelda,2022-11-06,Exceptional Staff were world class A lot of road works due to building works made it difficult to navigate. Also 16£ for parking is a bit steep
1423,Mike,2022-11-02,"Ok place to stay Staff in the day were amazing, so helpful. Location is perfect. Night staff rude, bar closed early and they served people in suits, not metalheads. Bed was small and soft, uncomfortable."
1424,Bernie,2022-10-27,Exceptional Staff excellent. Very helpful friendly service. Food was excellent. Gentle man on reception could not do enough for us. He was very helpful and friendly. Very good at his job.

1426,Simon,2022-10-20,"needs money spent on staff were great room carpet filthy, furniture dirty and not great"
1427,Melissa,2022-10-18,"disappointing and stuck in the 1980s proximity to the office I was working at , reception staff not much attention to detail eg room service menu on TV was low res and difficult to read. found a razor blade in my room, reported to reception (who apologised) but it was still there at the end of the day, staff at breakfast didn’t say good morning, irritating music playing in corridors, crisps cost £2.75 for a small bag which I thought was a bit much"
1428,Adam,2022-10-17,"Adequate for 1 night but wouldn’t use again Good location. Car parking on site. Small room, very tiny bathroom. The bed was extraordinarily squeaky - so every time one of us moved it like wake the other up; the bed was also very uncomfortable. Seems we were overcharged for breakfast, booking says it should’ve been £10 but we were charged £12 each."
1429,Jamie,2022-10-17,"staff are credit to the company. as for the hotel it’s very basic. sort your breakfast out before someone gets very ill the staff, very welcoming friendly and helpful. breakfast was horrific, and I mean terrible!!. rooms were very basic considering the price of the stay. like a overpriced travelodge."
1430,Alison,2022-10-16,greet place stay to see a show or shopping staff really helpful and friendly. not far from the train station. spotlessly clean. nothing
1431,Cristine,2022-10-12,Disappointing Friendly staff. Room cold. Unable to turn air conditioning fan off. Room dark. Felt overpriced
1432,Steve,2022-10-10,Great service and location Great service as always with comfy and clean rooms Breakfast- foods mixed together by other Guest using one spoon to take food. Affects dietary requirements meaning breakfast skipped.
1433,Izzy,2022-10-10,Overpriced but did what it needed to do whilst we were in Bristol for the weekend. The staff were friendly and welcoming upon arrival. The bedrooms need modernising. Creaky beds. Kept waking each other up when moving. Stains on the desk chair and kept lowering when sat on. Overall a very below average stay.
1434,Anne-marie,2022-10-08,Good for one night Breakfast was amazing it room more basic than expected and bed very hard Bed too hard and room very basic
1435,Rod,2022-10-06,Bar and car park prices extortionate Not good. Plates were cold. Ques for coffee tea machine. Toaster bleak Directions for car entry not provided for car park. £16 per night to park in hotel own car park
1436,Lydia,2022-10-05,very good and tasty omlette made by the chef for breakfast friendly helpful staff located by busy road and being charged for parking the car.
1437,Matthew,2022-10-03,"Disappointing The staff on arrival were nice. There was no hand soap in the bathroom when we arrived. The shower gel dispenser come of the wall on the shower when used once. Went down for breakfast, nobody at the door to explain where to sit or give any guidance so basically had to sit on a table with no cutlery. Check out was basically we've already got your money bye. Wouldn't stay here again"
1438,Liam,2022-10-02,Pleasant good location and clean. rooms were basic but nice. breakfast and room very expensive for what you got
1439,Kailey,2022-10-02,"clean & convenient , very basic the rooms were clean, sadly next to our room and at the end of the corridor empty cans and left over room service orders were left there all weekend the bed was extremely hard and noisy, parking was difficult"
1440,Anthony,2022-09-28,Good shame about the bed  Bed was to hard and I could not sleep because it eas not comfortable for me
1441,Andrew,2022-09-28,"Good hotel for a weekend stay for a wedding Great location, nice hotel with a good breakfast. The hotel team were incredibly helpful and friendly. When I thought I had lost my phone they put the effort in to ensuring I got it back. The directions to the hotel on Google Maps weren't entirely clear due to the large amount of building works taking place nearby, and I initially got a little lost finding the entrance. Use the entrance on the main road up from the station for easiest access."
1442,Judith,2022-09-27,"It was very convenient and comfortable. Parking was convenient, staff friendly breakfast was good. no hot water for shower on first day. extractor fan in bathroom didn't work. Bathroom very small and not very well equipped."
1443,Amanda,2022-09-25,Definitely not value for money. Won’t be revisiting ( and we visit Bristol regularly) Location Staff Parking Food. Poor quality breakfast and menu for room service and quality of food also poor No obvious information provided in the room about WiFi room service etc
1444,Vasantha,2022-09-25,"Fair Location is good. Written info in room, there’s was info on the TVPlayer."
1445,Richard,2022-09-24,Great apart from the broken lifts! Excellent staff. All very helpful and professional. The lift was broken. Luckily an excellent staff member carried my heavy bags up the stairs
1446,Yolanda,2022-09-22,Got exactly what we wanted Staff were so helpful and super polite Bed was so uncomfortable. I just don’t like firm mattresses so that’s my opinion really
1447,Hayley,2022-09-21,amazing! the manager & staff was very accommodating nothing it was perfect
1448,Zackary,2022-09-20,"amazing, professional and polite, the whole experience was amazing Room and Breakfast"
1449,Andy,2022-09-20,"Good location if travelling on foot. Good location in Bristol The on-site parking is very limited (and expensive) with small spaces and hard to navigate in anything but a small car. Also you are paying for the Hilton name, rooms a little tired for money paid."
1450,Aaron,2022-09-19,"really underwhelming, it was meant for an anniversary and my partner was really disappointed with the whole experience The location was perfect for what we wanted, also the bar area was lovely. The room was definitely not worth what I paid, there was dust on the top of everything, the lamp was broke, the bed was uncomfortable and the flush didn’t work properly in bathroom."
1451,Christopher,2022-09-18,"Location great, feel its a little expensive for the facilities and standard level off room Lactation was perfect for us as we just a short walk away from the Hippodrome for a show. Plenty of choice at breakfast and food was tasty. Upon arrival I was informed at reception that there is a £16 fee to use the hotel carpark. Nowhere did I see this mentioned when booking the hotel. I have never had to do this in any other hotel I've visited. I feel this extra charge made my stay not great value for money with this extra charge on top."
1452,Isobel,2022-09-17,"Enjoyable stay in this nice hotel Nice hotel, friendly, helpful staff and thought their menu was good. Would go back again There was nothing I could find fault with"

1455,Debra,2022-09-12,Perfect overnight city stay clean and comfortable bed City centre within walking distance of wedding venue we were attending
1456,Richard,2022-09-10,Disappointing nothing Most things. haven’t got time to type it all
1457,Alexander,2022-09-09,"Not worth the money! Location Ground floor accessible room allocated when requested high floor room, dated in places, bathroom sliding door didn’t open and close properly. Not asked how my Stay was at reception checking out and hot breakfast was cold- bacon and hash brown."
1458,Happy0427,2022-09-08,Great service by a great team Staff were 100% a credit Facilities were good Room was good It was raining Drinks at the bar were expensive
1459,Lou,2022-09-08,Urgent refurbishment required Nothing Now a very tired hotel. Needs total refurbishment to meet the Hilton group standards! Definitely not worth the money
1460,Sara,2022-09-04,"Exceptional Great location, very clean and modern. Friendly.,helpful staff, good value buffet breakfast with great selection. The shower wasn't as powerful as we like."
1461,Ben,2022-09-04,"Passable I had high hopes for this hotel as I associate the Hilton with nice properties. When we arrived at our room it absolutely stank of cigarette smoke. There was constant noise throughout the night in the corridor which was not stopped by anyone . The bed wasn’t very comfortable . to be fair, the staff were all very pleasant it was just the room that let it down- we paid a little more to stay in this nicer hotel and would have had a better time in a cheaper competitor ."
1462,Karin,2022-08-30,Just what we were looking for. Great value and location close to the city centre. very friendly helpful staff. rel pillows too big
1463,Bland,2022-08-30,"All in all positive experience, would return staff were extremely friendly and helpful. light didn’t work in wardrobe, no shower gel in bottle in the shower. Attention to detail with these things could be improved"
1464,Traveller,2022-08-30,"Not value for money  Breakfast was poor quality, poached eggs were drowned in vinegar, cheese was dry and curling and salad was old Room hadn’t been cleaned properly and was dusty, soaps were empty and hadn’t been refilled No room cleaning on the third day Pillows very thin No plug socket on both sides of bed"
1465,Kevin,2022-08-29,clean and tidy but not again due to price and location. location parking and run down area of the city
1466,Edwin,2022-08-29,"It was ok. for the price goodish. It was clean and the staff delightful Over my life I have stayed at many Hiltons, all very good, to mention Park Lane , London and many times at The Gatwick Hilton, delightful. I was mislead maybe because of the name Hilton, The Hotel I stayed in was not a Hilton, my fault as I should have considered the price more, but there it is, it was just an average good hotel."
1467,Julia,2022-08-29,Bristol trip Location good and the knight templer history in close proximity Very hard bed. The bed had wheels made alot of noise especially whilst turning in bed.. One morning the breakfast was cold I had to as ask for it to be microwaved.
1468,Mathew,2022-08-23,Disappointed. Expected more from the Hilton brand.. Breakfast was as expected Unable to get served food on both evenings of our stay. Arrived early evening expecting to be able to eat in the hotel restaurant- unable to be served as the Restuarant had a block booking on both nights. Very disappointed. Not even offered a snack or sandwich 😦
1469,Allan,2022-08-23,This straw broke the camel’s (and my) back Location is brilliant for my office. Staff are welcoming and friendly despite the challenges they have to overcome. Beds are the worst I have ever slept in (including wartime German bunks) Air conditioning was so noisy it couldn’t be used at night despite 20 degree heat outside Desk light didn’t work so couldn’t work in the evening. Reported it but nobody came to sort it out. Room was not cleaned or replenished for the two nights I was there The restaurant couldn’t feed staying guests for the two nights because of large coach parties booked in Such a shame because our two businesses use this hotel on a regular basis but we’re moving up the road.
1470,Alexander,2022-08-21,"Poor Air con didn't work, so we were moved to another room by the really nice staff. They sorted this ASAP. Amazing beds! Very clean and nice decor. Our floor smelled of weed, I think the people in the room opposite were smoking it. Creeped through our door and all our stuff started to smell of it slightly. The TV's in the room are awful. Old, non HD, wouldn't work as intended. We found it really slow/hard to change channels etc."
1471,Paul,2022-08-21,"We were a little disappointed with certain aspects of the room we were allocated The staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast was good. Overall, the cleanliness of the room and shower room was good. Charge of £16 to Park in the hotel car park was rather high. The bed and pillows were very hard and difficult to sleep on. Bottles of shower gel/shampoo in the shower were all empty. Carpet was rather tired with old stains"
1472,Ceri,2022-08-16,Wouldn’t stay here again Some staff were lovely. Room not ready upon arrival even though I’d stated an arrival time. Dirty linen in corridors every day. Beds uncomfortable and creaking.Breakfast poor overcooked bacon undercooked sausages and cold eggs. Restaurant closed one night no prior notice given. Everything
1473,Amelia,2022-08-15,"Enjoyable , relaxing , great service Facilities , staff , lovely food at restaurant and the choice at breakfast . Bedroom was nice Carpark was very expensive saying you’ve paid a lot already booking a room . Also air con not very powerful in the rooms especially during the hot weather"
1474,Matt,2022-08-15,"Very bad nights sleep Location to harbour side The room was stiflingly hot, the air conditioning was not working across the whole hotel. I asked for a fan which the staff provided but it just blew hot air around the room. We did not sleep at all... I expected a lot more from a Hilton hotel. The was also no pre warning of this, had there been we'd have chosen a different hotel!"
1475,Minnette,2022-08-12,"we come every year, great hotel great staff it was easily accessible, clean and refreshing lemon water was on tap in reception brilliant the cooler didn’t work but we’re offered another room but we were just along from my brothers room"
1476,Elke,2022-08-11,Pleasant Location was good and the park behind the hotel was beautiful. The staff were nice. It was really expensive for what it was and U looked on other days and the price was a lot less and included breakfast. We paid £260 for two night twin room and breakfast wasn't included - although I thought it was supposed to be. It was really loud on our first night over night.
1477,Mrs,2022-08-10,"Pleasant, but with flaws..... Best thing ,i have to say was the chef and restaurant staff,for our breakfast the following morning...I have ms and eat particuler food combinations..Not totally strange, but most places, find requests hard at times...My husband enjoyed his big breakfast immensely(he's a normal)..and mine 2 eggs on avocado(no toast) ...perfect...even made me a smoothie to drink...Great start to the day and rounded, a not so great start to our break to, excellent....People sometimes need to remember ,that it's the small things that count............... Reception on arrival...Was a hot day, and our journey was full of traffic, not the hotels fault granted...BUT,..We were due to check-in at 3pm and didnt arrive till 4.15...to find room not ready??..Sitting in lobby and left with the option of 'choc or crisps' ...no...So as receptionist didnt see the need to give/suggest another ready room, i did her job and approached to ask for another ready room...Granted........See not hard...BUT would have been better some forsight on her part....The Hilton Garden Inn, not a chain that i would think needed a customer service skills reminder...........!"
1478,John,2022-08-08,"Exceptional The staff, location and atmosphere of the hotel was brilliant. Everything was perfect. No complaints at all."
1479,Emma,2022-08-08,"Fun All the staff were so helpful and friendly. Gary especially was an absolute star! Making sure we had blankets and drinks whilst sat outside the bar and his sense of humour was brilliant! Price of room, very over priced"

1483,Steven,2022-08-06,"Great hotel to visit Friendly service, Annie and Jenny on front desk were so kind and helpful. Annie went over and above to help us with accommodation for late arrival of my son who needed 2 rooms for his family which made a difficult situation easily sorted out. Can't thank her enough also for giving us ground floor room as my wife's legs were bad and she doesn't like lifts. Wonderful experience all round and will definitely be back on our next visit to Bristol. Lovely staff good breakfast EXCELLENT."
1484,Samantha,2022-08-06,"The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and we had a wonderful stay! I love the property, it’s always clean and tidy and the rooms are great value for money. But the staff are the greatest. Nothing to dislike"
1485,Sue,2022-08-05,Good place to stay Location difficult to find by car. Food ok
1486,Tammie,2022-08-04,"Could have been better Staff were really pleasant and helpful. Restaurant and bar area was lovely and breakfast was great. Our room was an accessible room and felt a little snug. Bed was small but comfortable. Window led out onto the street making the room feel a little overlooked and the rubber seal around the window was loose and hanging. The bathroom was brilliant - plenty of room with excellent facilities but the door would not close properly. The ceiling especially, but also the walls and skirt boards were marked or scuffed, giving the room an overall tired feel."
1487,Natalie,2022-08-04,Exceptional Very helpful friendly staff. Knowledgeable of the area
1488,Michael,2022-08-04,"Could not have wished for a better stay, made very welcomed and even the weather held. The staff were exceptional very polite and helpful the breakfast was excellent and the location could not have been better. The bathroom was a little small, could not turn the heating right down but that could be me"
1489,Natalie,2022-08-02,Exceptional Hotel was Ok bed comfortable and nice shower. For the price of £9.50 breakfast was not worth is very sparse options and what was there wasn't great. Coffee there was terrible. overall for the price of the room I paid £320 for two nights it was not worth it.
1490,Mark,2022-07-31,Basic and not a value for money Room was basic but ok The hotel is weary and in need of some renovations.
1491,David,2022-07-31,"Disappointing - not like I expect a Hilton to be The staff were very helpful Room was too hot, bed was tiny, roadworks all round the hotel made it impossible to get to using sat nav, and had to end up ringing hotel. Don't know why this wasn't sent out on an email before warning of this"

1494,Eyaner,2022-07-26,"perfect location, had everything I needed for an amazing stay :) such a beautiful hotel and only a very short walk to temple meads station which was perfect for me. the room was so comfortable I didn’t even feel like I was staying in a hotel, it felt like home. it was my first time travelling to Bristol and I did so alone. my train got me in earlier than expected, the staff were so helpful and allowed me to check in a little bit earlier. all staff I interacted with during my stay was amazing so friendly and welcoming :)"
1495,Amy,2022-07-25,great stay everything I didn’t get my Hilton honours points :-(
1496,Andreaf,2022-07-24,Exceptional Nearly to Central Nothing
1497,Carol,2022-07-20,we had a late check in. Receptionist didn’t have a clue what to do. Near centre of town Breakfast staff were not advising guests where things were. People were walking around trying to find things. Guy in charge VERY condescending.
1498,Jade,2022-07-19,"Amazing stay, great staff great place will be back! Staff was all really helpful and professional. The full English breakfasts was cooked lovely. they had a really good range of other options too, such as fruit cereals meats /cheese ect. They made it really special for us by popping proceco in our room on ice. At a reasonable charge.They called to confirm everything before our stay too! Thankyou to all the staff we will be back again. We didn't have any issues with the rooms or facility's but some mini toothpaste in the room?"
1499,Suvinder,2022-07-17,it was just tolerable it was very basic parking was poor
1500,Burgin,2022-07-16,"I'll do that when I get my bill The staff were exceptional Not receiving my bill yet,it's a disgrace"
1501,Linda,2022-07-15,"Have had much better experience at other Hilton’s . it had a wardrobe in the room ( missing at premier inns) fridge was very handy . The shower was pathetic no pressure what so ever , hard mattress, very hard and uncomfortable pillows, bar person unhelpful , I can’t believe you don’t stock a 2nd bottle of Malibu . the measure was the last bit in the bottom but due to it being about 3mm short of the full measured barman refused to serve it , he refused to see if you had further stock just said you didn’t without looking . A bit of a disappointing visit . your standards appear to have dropped."
1502,Brian,2022-07-12,"Pokey room and don't arrive hungry! Check in/out was efficient Access with a car is impossible. You have to turn into a one-way street, going the wrong way, from the main road. Otherwise, you can't access it. GoogleMaps can't even find the correct entrance. No filter coffee for breakfast - only Americano from a full automatic. Dreadful. I arrived at 22:15 and couldn't even get a sandwich. The kitchen closes at 21:45 and there's nothing nearby. I ended up walking 2km to a McD and eating it in a bus shelter!"

1506,Natalia,2022-07-08,"lobby downstairs was deceiving because it looked very new. The hotel overall just needs a good refurbishment, it is a Hi Staff were absolutely amazing, nice and kind very professional!! the rooms were ridiculously small. Paid for a Queen Room which I thought was a larger room but it wasn’t. the bathroom was smaller than a cupboard which was a massive no."
1507,Josh,2022-07-05,"Exceptional Located about a 5 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station. Staff, especially front desk and Food & Beverage, especially friendly and helpful. Have no real complaints. business center with access to desktop computer and printer would be helpful."
1508,Chris,2022-07-04,Disappointing will not go again.  Two single beds pushed together are not a king size bed. They were uncomfortable. Breakfast poor quality. Lack of fruit. Most tasteless. Felt like works canteen.
1509,Jacqueline,2022-07-04,Excellent service throughout The staff were very friendly and helpful..and location was good...room was comfortable and they were kind enough to let us have an accessible room.. Nothing that I would say was bad and that I didnt like..
1510,Michelle,2022-06-28,Hard mattress and nothing extra to justify paying the Hilton price. Close to the train station and some shops and restaurants are not too far away. The bed was too hard. Considering the hotel was a Hilton I expected something more.

Our room wasn't cleaned, bed made, clean towels etc on last day. We didn't get back to the hotel until 12am so didn't bother complaining. There was mould on the shower frame."

1523,Thomas,2022-06-14,Not worth £75.00 will not be staying again it was clean and reception staff were helpful The mattress was rock solid and there was no water in the bedroom
1524,Anthea,2022-06-13,"Short Break Friendly staff, comfy bed, nice small gym with modern equipment and clean communal areas. Terrible parking. Bays should be allocated on booking to allow guests to come and go as they please rather than be to scared to drive as they will not get a space on return. Stains on the blackout blinds looked like oil, room small for two adults, no usb points in these modern times, room was clean but looked a bit old fashioned. Small bathroom, paint flaking above shower. Bit far from restaurants if you have to walk as you don't want to lose your parking space."
1525,Mark,2022-06-12,"Easy to book, difficult to get parked, staff very helpful but room too hot and it was noisy Staff were great, hotel was clean Parking a nightmare. Room too hot even with air con. Noisy streets below"

Nice location real close to the station and walking distance from the city Doesn't have the charm of a small hotel with unique rooms, but that's to be expected"
1529,Emma,2022-06-07,Just what was needed We had to book very last minute when our easyJet flight home was cancelled. The booking was easy & staff very friendly
1530,Nix,2022-06-06,"Stay ruined by noise and loud, drunk guests Very friendly and helpful staff. Great facilities. Room was large, clean and comfortable. I am surprised that it turned out to be a ""party hotel"" - I expect better of Hilton. We were woken several times in the night including from 1-1:30am by drunk people running around the corridors, doors banging, and shouting (we were on the 3rd floor). Such a shame and spoiled what would otherwise have been an excellent stay."
1531,Hollie,2022-06-05,best hotel stay this year amazing care from all staff and even had free drinks for a birthday! extremely comfortable bed and lovely facilities

1537,Joshua,2022-05-26,Great stay with very accommodating staff. Staff very accommodating and friendly. Allowed us to leave our bags behind the desk before checking in so could do stuff in the city prior to check out without needing to carry them round.
1538,Paul,2022-05-25,"OK but pricey for what it is Very comfy bed, good temperature in the room, nice bathroom. Very expensive for parking and drinks. Went to Wetherspoons for breakfast and saved a fortune!"

Nothing to like, 1 star hotel under the name of Hilton.Bad management.Very rude receprionist.No securised Wifi, dirty room, 1 shower gel for 2 pers., bed on wheels like in the hospital, no controlled AC, only ventilation full of bacterias.Tiny bathroomHorror view from the room.Stay away!"
1548,Hajnalka,2022-05-11,Just what we needed for a night stay. Close to train station. Glass of lemon water at reception was a very nice touch. Receptionist was very welcoming. The pillows were not very comfortable.
1549,Sean,2022-05-09,"Great stay, thank you! Great location, super team of people. Room great and an amazingly good breakfast The only thing I didn't like was seeing the red indicator below this box that I am writing in slowly change to green as I type....there was nothing that we could fault with our stay at Browns. I am sure that many other people go and stay at places with the sole purpose to find fault...if only they bothered to engage with the people who run and work in hospitality not treat them and what they do with disdain and a negative outlook. It's green now, so I'll stop!"
1550,Joanne,2022-05-07,avoid at the weekend if you like to sleep room was clean and comfortable. bed and bathroom fine. nice park to look out on to. whole corridor on which we stayed became a party venue with people rolling in at 0230 shouting singing banging doors. managed to drown out the party noise by hiking up the aircon but could still hear the doors banging as they went from room to room. kept awake from 0230 until the sun came up about 0530. reception useless. no signs anywhere asking people to be quiet when coming in late. no security to deal with the yobs. Travelodge and Premier Inn have family corridors and signage asking people to be considerate when coming in late. reception said that it was too difficult for the Hilton to arrange this. won’t be back. very disappointed. if you can’t sleep properly at a hotel it’s failed really hasn’t it?
1551,Richard,2022-05-06,Great hotel would highly recommend Lovely location very friendly polite and curtious great price good value for money lovely hotel room very spacious all little extras such as fridge and safe could not fault it in anyway would definitely recommend to all went that extra mile in every way Nothing

1566,Eric,2022-04-15,A great break to celebrate our anniversary. Room had nice view and was quiet. The hotel was close to the railway station with a very easy walk. We had an evening meal which was well prepared and the staff were cheerful and attentive. Shower room extraction fan not working

There was not much noise other than what you would expect from a hotel. It's not that it put me off the hotel, as it didn't, but the facility to have water to drink in the room would have been an added bonus, Though there is a massive water cooler in the reception, it's not practical to come up and down from the 4th floor to get some."

1574,Colin,2022-04-04,"frustrating Hilton to me is synonymous with quality which to be honest was found a little wanting. staff were pretty good when you pointed things out to them. had some discount on bills because of things going wrong. Booked king room, shown into a normal room. had to be relocated once we pointed this out . TV non functional which apparently was the same in all the rooms, staff had reported it apparently but it was an issue for all of our stay and had been for the previous week. Bit of plastic bag found in my soup, directions to hotel need updating due to all the construction work taking place in the vicinity,"

1578,Timothy,2022-03-28,Poor The cocktails Being over charged at the end of are stay though the mistake of the hotel staff.and the large amount of dust in our room also and the lack of information in the room.and the breakfast was absolutely disgusting.
1579,Allan,2022-03-28,"Enjoyed Bristol with the hotel being close to Temple Meads and the water ferry. Handy for Temple Meads and not too far to walk to the city centre. The hotel is clean and modern i.e. with the uniformity that goes with new-builds. For the price I would have expected more space in the room and en-suite. The hotel is having problems with its supplier and many of the electronics don't work adequately - wi-fi and tv. Breakfast was buffet style and over-priced, with the lamp-warmers seemingly placed too high to adequately warm the food."

1584,Melissa,2022-03-20,"Well-situated, clean and complete amenities First hotel with a laundry room instead of the overpriced laundry services. it was super helpful. for me this was the best perk ever. breakfast is good with various choices for every taste, gym is clean, view to park is nice. close to the train station, which is convenient. Friendly staff. Overall very satisfied."

Room was clean One tv channel worked, asked the staff about it ended up with two members of staff in my room at unsocial-able hours trying to get to wire at the back of the tv when I told them it was already not possible as I had looked myself they insisted on staying in the room and messing with the remote which again I had told them I had already done so and then became rude when I asked them to leave and stayed for more longer than needed."

1589,Alison,2022-03-13,"Passable Location very good, hotel seemed in reasonable condition Two nights in a row I was awake between 3am and 4.30am with noise of drunk people in rooms nearby and in the hallway. I let the hotel know after the first night, they sent me a message to apologise and said they would keep an eye out the next night. The 2nd night was worse. Music and people in room next door, people in corridor shouting to try find their room because they couldn't find key or remember where they were staying, trying random doors, slamming doors. I gave the feedback to the receptionist as I checked out and she apologised and says it wasn't within their control. I beg to differ. I have travelled at lot with work over the years and this was not acceptable; its your hotel, you make the rules. You knew there was potential for disturbance and did not take responsibility."
1590,Charlotte,2022-03-06,Passable Location was good Beds were really uncomfortable. Doors banging throughout the night until 3am. Worst nights sleep I’ve had in a long time. Room was tiny.

1596,Joanne,2022-02-24,"Nice stay but overpriced Room was very clean but quite small despite upgrading. Location was good, Breakfast was excellent. Staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant was very overpriced so ate out Stayed at a premier inn for the first night and felt the extra 40 pounds extra to stay at the Hilton didn't warrant the price. Premier had much larger rooms, nice bar and restaurant. However breakfast was not as good as the Hilton. Unfortunately due to location and value for money I would return to the premier Inn which is a shame."

1613,Paul,2022-01-24,"Nice enough but never coming back, overpriced for what you get. Friendly staff, good location. Parking on site (albeit chargeable) Room was small, bed too firm, pillows were awful had a terrible sleep. For some reason there was an extra chair in the room that did nothing but get in the way as it was too big. Breakfast was OK but items had been sat around for a while - the poached eggs were hard boiled."
1614,Ei,2022-01-23,Exceptional I couldn't express how much I was satisfied with this Hilton Garden Inn. The room was extremely clean and we can smell the good washing from the blankets and the pillows. The people who give services were also nice and polite. 100% Thumb-up!
1615,Tammy,2022-01-22,"Passable Great location to train station Poor and limited menu,may be covidcrelated though. No literature in the room for menu, couldn't connect to reception to order in"
1616,Jonathan,2022-01-21,nice hotel needs some maintenance clean nice room air conditioning in room would not heat therefore very cold. shower broken. service during dinner very slow
1617,Michael,2022-01-17,"Nothing special Comfortable bed, chiller in the room, proper toiletries and hairdryer (not fixed to wall and able to control properly) park view Hotel seems a bit tired, needs some TLC. Very average breakfast, pre cooked cold sausages, staff unable to cope, limited toasting facilities. Expensive parking"
1618,Pat,2022-01-13,a delightful sojourn excellent staff and restaurant bar no Hilton points because you booked through Booking’s

En-suite needs updating But everything else was great"
1622,Elizabeth,2022-01-05,Disappointing but didn't ruin our stay. The hotel was clean The room was a lot smaller than expected especially after paying for an upgrade. The king sized bed was two singles pushed together and the 'garden view' was the road.

1632,Serena,2021-12-20,"Unsafe  There were guests banging on the walls, screaming in the hallway and knocking on the room of my door right the way through the night. At 3.30am I went downstairs to tell reception, and as I came back up to my room after this - a man in nothing but his underwear was stood outside my hotel room door. I felt extremely uncomfortable and unsafe. After telling the night staff, the noise stopped for about 30 minutes then commenced again at 4am. Myself and my friend in my twin room got no sleep. My friend decided to leave the hotel at 5.30am because all the banging and knocking on our door made them have a panic attack. I did not feel safe either and did not get any sleep"
1633,Mark,2021-12-19,we will stay here again very clean and staff fro
1634,Neil,2021-12-19,"Ok, but poor value. No breakfast as needed to catch 07.00 train and not available. Lovely staff at breakfast but poor food available only. Small rooms in need of refurbishment. Not up to quality indicated by price. No water in the room. Tiny bathroom."

1643,Jake,2021-12-05,Exceptional The cleanliness the location and the staff Parking was tricky at times but the staff helped out by moving cars to allow the parking.. and there was a function in the down stairs bar in the Saturday night so I didn’t get the luxury of chilling in the downstairs bar when mrs had an early night
1644,Carol,2021-12-03,"Excellent hotel and well placed to transport links. Walking distance of train station. Approx 10-15 min walk to shopping centre and harbour side area of the city.

All the staff we encountered were exceptionally helpful and characterised by cheerfulness. The location is excellent for access to the City centre. Breakfast was very good and a wide choice of menu was available in the restaurant each day and evening. The bar was well stocked and welcoming with extremely obliging staff. We will be visiting Bristol again in a few months and will definitely stay here. Nothing. This was excellent value for money and we will stay again."

1659,Clarke,2021-11-22,"Amazing Staff 👏 As a family, we could not fault any aspect of our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. Any interaction we had with staff and management was outstanding. As a seasoned travel, I have to say this was probably the best hotel experience I've ever had. Professional, Polite, Friendly and Caring. I cannot complement all staff highly enough. Nothing."
1660,Kalila,2021-11-22,"perfect would definitely recommend staff were so friendly and helpful, checked us in early for free and helped us find where we needed nothing"
1661,Fiona,2021-11-19,good enough for an overnight it’s basic but that’s what is expected took over 20 minutes to check in at 3 pm. poo on loo seat. no room service menu when online it says it’s available. also I’d asked for a quiet room but was on the roadside. it didn’t actually disturb my sleep because I was really tired but….
1662,Laura,2021-11-16,"A very nice, clean, comfortable hotel to spend a couple of nights in Bristol The room was surprisingly nice! I had not expected it to look so new and modern and it was impeccably clean. The bed was big and EXTREMELY comfortable - my partner has back issues and this mattress was one of the few during our trip that he felt at ease sleeping on. The place had plenty of mirrors for getting ready to go out for a night or for a walkabout in the morning. It also had a lot of storage available in the room. The hotel provided shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap, and body lotion (as per usual), but they smelled very nice and didn't feel cheap like so many often do. The wifi was very strong and we had no issues getting online. The room was very quiet. We didn't hear any of the other guests or anyone on the street outside during our stay despite only staying on the first floor. The view from the windows of the park across was nice, though best experienced in the day as not much could be seen at night. The hotel was very easy to navigate. Parking was very simple. We were able to get a 24-hour parking pass from the time of our arrival and keep the car in the small lot just in front of the hotel making our worries about leaving our car in a lot down the street unnecessary. The fee for the 24-hour stay was only £16, very affordable compared to the other park and pay options in the area. The staff were very helpful at check-in and check-out. Nothing comes to mind - the stay was very pleasant and everything you would hope for from a night in a hotel in a new city. The only blip was with the parking fee. We thought we paid the fee at check-in but the clerk was a bit busy and must not have completed the transaction so we received a bill for parking in the morning after thinking that we had already paid for it. It was easily worked out at the front desk at checkout and the money had not been taken from our account. So it was a non-issue in the end."
1663,Mikolaj,2021-11-16,Exceptional Friendly staff and very clean room.

The staff are all very pleasant, helpful & accommodating. The room was lovely with the view, clean & tidy. The bed was comfortable. The other areas of the hotel are also very clean & tidy. Breakfast was good & had a variety of either continental or cooked. I'd stay here again without any hesitation in the future for sure."
1667,Keith,2021-11-15,"Adequate were not at the hotel due to being out all day. The closeness to Temple Mead Station. The room being ready before normal check in. The well trained staff. The room was of adequate size but rather tired , stains to carpet, dressing table drawers falling to pieces so drawers did not shut. we had booked into the Recess bar /restaurant . we had looked at the on line menu and the prices seemed reasonable although menu was not very extensive . We arrived for our 6.30 booking the the noise from a large group of drinkers was horrendous - not good when you suffer from tinnitus; the menu was even more reduced; the prices had gone up and the portions very small my husbands piece of fish was the size of a childs portion. My Husband received a charge docket which he signed very surprised to find additional charges for service and and tips. If there was a note on the menu re these charges it was that small it was missed."
1668,Mark,2021-11-14,"I would definitely recommend this hotel after my great stay Great stay, lovely friendly staff and made feel welcome :). Nothing"
1669,Julie,2021-11-13,Ok Our room was overlooking the garden which was lovely. But unfortunately over the bar area which was very noisy at night. The beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable. The pillows were cheap and very soft. The breakfast was very good with great choice. The staff were very friendly and very accommodating. See above
1670,Hilmir,2021-11-10,"Nice Hotel. It´s a nice Hotel that I have booked a few times, nice breakfast, comfy bed and nice shower. It´s a in a good location, short walk from the centre, nice and helpful staff. The Rooms are outdate and in dire need of update, carpets were dirty, desk chair was old and tired, arm ripped and it would not hold it´s position. The room was dirty and could have used better cleaning. Check out made us loose our train into London as the nightshift had refunded my payment and I was charged again in the morning. But helpful manager sorted it out but it took a bit of time."

1674,James,2021-11-05,"Very good until the breakfast. Room very good, staff very pleasant and helpful. Evening meal very good. Breakfast :- total let down. All the food was barely warm and made worse with thick cold plates. Example _ eggs fried and left to get cold for ages, scrambled eggs over cooked and almost cold ,along with everything else, no where near worth the money. Try eating a breakfast at 8.30 am and see if you agree"

1692,Stuartvilla,2021-10-24,"Poor sleep on first of 2 nights. We went as to run a race the first of our two mornings. However very disturbed sleep on our first of two nights. TV in the next room was on full volume on our return at 11 pm. Could never sleep through this, after 3 hours at 2 AM I phoned reception who then came quickly. They entered the room 436 and muted the TV. Ruined our rest and our run was nothing like we thought it would be,due to lack of sleep. Everything else was great,but the main reason for our stay was to have a goodnight sleep for our run. Room 434 was very nice, but why no porter to check floors? it was obvious to us in the corridor that TV was way too loud. Why do TVs need such loud volume in a hotel? A real shame as many lovely things to say of the hotel but our memories are all about our lack of sleep. Alter maximum volume on TVs maybe then this could never have happened."
1693,Philip,2021-10-20,Exceptional Great location. Easy access to train station
1694,Nikita,2021-10-17,"Birthday weekend The property is in a great location, the staff were super friendly and everything was very clean The room was small considering the price we paid. The TV was almost useless in our room, poor signal and very few channels with no TV guide or info. Quite disappointing for an expensive room. There are minimal facilities but this is understandable given the location and size."
1695,Kristina,2021-10-16,"Passable Location EV charger not working, or non ev cars parked in spaces therefore unable to charge our car No tv remote in bedroom Bed really hard and creaky. Organised a later checkout before arriving but was asked multiple times when we were leaving meaning having to explain over and over."
1696,Mae,2021-10-13,Pleasant It was clean and accessible. At night I can hear pipes or some noise that sound like water or someone running a bath or something. It went on all evening and I’m a light sleeper so I count sleep. That’s a big deal for me.
1697,Taylor,2021-10-11,"Kinda like a one night stand, alright for a one off but wouldn't go again Close walk to the city centre. First off I put in my notes that we were celebrating a birthday weekend and if they could make it special, they replied saying they have put it in their notes. Absolutely nothing on arrival. Also paying for parking on site is a massive downfall to the location."
1698,Natasha,2021-10-11,Exceptional Very welcoming and approachable staff
1699,Bea,2021-10-07,"This hotel does not deserve your custom . The room was a standard size, and the bathroom had a good shower with good hot water. The room had a good wardrobe and storage space, which is a rarity. Breakfast, which I paid for includes in the price, was really good, including plant based options. The hotel restaurant had reasonable food. Small portions and some unreasonably expensive but others a good value for money. Restaurant/breakfast staff were really nice. The hotel fitness room was small and rather basic (i.e no barbells). The hotel is 10 mins from the train station and 10mins from the city centre. Although on a busy road I didn't find the room noisy, although truth be said I never have trouble sleeping! The hotel has a ""no housekeeping "" policy at the moment. This meant I had to take my dirty mugs to reception and ask for clean mugs, my room was not hoovered during my stay, let alone the rest of the room tidied. To suggest this is because of ""COVID safety measures"" is an insult to your customers, considering that all the staff (including and particularly the housekeeping staff) are about their business without wearing masks and that there is no contact between the housekeeping staff and the guest during housekeeping. This is blunt cost cutting disguised as a COVID measure. When I challenged reception about this I was told that I had been misinformed (despite the fact I was given a written notice specifying no housekeeping will be done) housekeeping was available if booked the evening before...I don't know, perhaps the virus takes exception when it's told someone will do the room in advance? I'm not sure whether I'm more crosses about the lack of service or the insult of the hotel trying to pretend it's about COVID. And of course no harm will happen to me for not having housekeeping for a few days, but if I pay for a hotel it's because I want that extra pampering, otherwise, I book an Airbnb which is cheaper and where I do my own hoovering and pot washing. This hotel does not deserve your custom and your hard earned cash."
1700,Julie,2021-10-03,"Good location, very clean. Excellent wifi The hotel was very well located, 5 mins walk from Temple Meads station and right in the city. The staff were very helpful providing us with extra toiletries on request and arranging a taxi to the airport for us. The room was very comfortable and clean and quiet despite being on a main road. The wifi was excellent. Lovely shower and heated mirror that cleared instantly. Good hairdryer, iron and ironing board in room. Very impressed - will stay there again"
1701,Jonathan,2021-09-29,Passable Location good For the price the room was very small. Mid week meal at home was far better than the supposed chef at work for the evening meal. Breakfast okay but cold. Not value for money in my experience and wouldn’t stay at a Hilton again. Very over rated.
1702,Vicki,2021-09-23,"Fantastic customer service Superb Great food, fantastic helpful staff. Really good value for money No problems at all"
1703,Claudia,2021-09-22,"Quality not as good as other Hilton hotels. Room OK, but breakfast was disappointing. Good location in relation to the city centre. Bed was comfortable, nice toiletry products. Breakfast was disappointing. Waffle machine was out of order, not enough cheese and cut meats available, no croissants available. Everything was a bit low on quality. The reception staff were grumpy. Next day they were friendly, but then grumpy again in the afternoon. Very changeable."
1704,David,2021-09-22,Very good hotel to stay. Breakfast was really good and with a good choice to choose from. Easy to get to from the railway station and just a short walk from the docks.

1706,Alex,2021-09-20,"Not good value for money. Much better value for nicer hotels can be found in city centre Location to Bristol city centre and friendliness and helpfulness of the staff Value is terrible. Nearly 200 euros (not including breakfast) for 1 night given how utilitarian the hotel is. It is not a pretty hotel. I stayed in the Leonardo Hotel across the road during the same weekend for less than half the price, which is a lot more luxurious, larger bedroom and bathroom."
1707,Rita,2021-09-20,"Highly recommend Central, clean and comfortable Staff were friendly and took time to chat with you and gave advice on things to do & see. Couldn’t fault the room or the service Would go back Nothing"

1711,Fredrik,2021-09-20,"Disappointing  Room was not cleaned, even though we asked for it (after 3 nights). It's a ripoff not to do daily cleaning and still maintain the high prices. Room price far too high for the standard. Bad selection on cold breakfast items."

1716,Stuart,2021-09-11,"Disappointing The location is good and the hotel has parking. The staff we met were helpful and polite. The shower was terrible (no pressure, little heat, broken door) and the breakfast was the worst I’ve had in a hotel."
1717,Louise,2021-09-11,"overnight stay General comfort was good and staff were very nice , air con is very noisy and it’s difficult because it’s not possible to open the windows.so I couldn’t sleep. no bath only showers. fire alarm was set off at 1:45 am and I had to get down 5 flights of stairs into the car park."
1718,Jon,2021-09-09,"Will insist on other side of hotel because of the traffic noise which kept us awake for our stay. Liked the room , great shower and bed but would have prefered to be the other side of the hotel as the traffic noise was terrible and didnt sleep. As ive said the traffic noise spoilt the whole experience"
1719,John,2021-09-02,"Fabulous hotel. This is a lovely hotel, very well located and not far from Temple Meads station, very professional staff, room was well equipped with a great shower and a very comfortable bed and tea and coffee making facilities. Little desk to be able to work too and easy to regulate the temperature of the room to stay cool. Cannot fault any part of it, very much a thumbs up from me."
1720,Jose,2021-09-01,"Please avoid - Waffle machine for breakfast Did feel COVID-unfriendly as there was someone self-isolating in the room just in front of us and every time we entered or left our room there were leftovers in the hallway: trash, food plates, you name it. I'm unsure if that person had tested positive or not, but surely if halfway through their stay they test positive the risks for other guests is quite high? Especially given that they were allowed to receive things outside of their room door by their friends/family/whomever and we even saw the self-isolating person inside the room with an open door chatting to the person that had just brought them something. Other things that made the stay subpar: - Not in the city centre - Bathroom was *extremely* small. Two people cannot stand up in that bathroom unless one of them is inside the shower. - Ceiling painting in the bathroom was peeling off - Paid extra for garden views. The views were quite limited, and I would definitely not call that a garden - Waiters at breakfast were quite pushy to take our plates away even mid-eating. It even happened twice that they only asked if it was ok to pick our plates AFTER they had actually picked them up - 99% sure that the 'pain au chocolat' they offer for breakfast is the DIY you can buy at the supermarket were you put two cylinders of chocolate inside the dough and then oven it for 20 mins."
1721,Susan,2021-09-01,"Really enjoyed our stay here Room was big enough hot water was plentiful for your shower, brilliant breakfast very good such a wide choice to eat, all staff very friendly. Very clean throughout and staff very helpful. Just thought the food prices at night were a little expensive"
1722,Maria,2021-09-01,"Lovely 5 nights stay The breakfast at the Hilton was great. There was a selection of cereals, toast, cooked breakfast. The bar and restaurant really make this hotel. The location was ideal and walking distance to everything. I would advise to park at the Bristol Temple Quarter car park near the train station because the hotel car park was full. The restaurant manager is great and super friendly. All was great"
1723,Shellane,2021-08-30,"An okay week but could have been better. Good location, close to family and destination of occasion for travel. Very nice and quiet area, really nice staff. Easy walk into city Centre and shopping mall. Close to beautiful sights and a few good restaurants too. It would have been nice if at least breakfast was included in the price. Cost for parking is ridiculous with no consideration to the amount already paid for room. Not all buttons worked on the remote control, did not even have access to the tv guide.It being Civid times and house keeping not cleaning rooms while people are staying, supplying enough tea, coffee, toilet rolls and such for the time staying would be more convenient than having to ask each time we run out."
1724,Alessandro,2021-08-30,Nice bank holiday in Bristol Service and room cleaning
1725,Samantha,2021-08-30,Exceptional Lovely hotel. Staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast was yummy 😋
1726,Nicky,2021-08-28,"The bed is only suitable if you don't like comfort  - the bed was solid, it was horrible. Even the budget places soft beds. It felt horrible. - parking is a one way, narrow system. Where everyone parks everywhere. It was okay, in that we did park. So I thank that, but the system is awful"
1727,Hannah,2021-08-27,"Wouldn't recommend, unclean and loud Location was great Room wasnt very clean, hairs everywhere, bathroom/shower unclean with marks - would be disappointed with this normally, let alone during the pandemic. We had stayed at this same hotel last September and we enjoyed our stay then with no cleanliness issues, but we were really disappointed this time. Air conditioning unit was also very loud, too loud for sleeping. We switched it off part way through the night but then it had a bright green flashing light when switched off which also wasn't ideal for sleeping. Parking is very expensive, even for the area. Breakfast was overcooked. Overall wouldn't recommend."
1728,Brian,2021-08-26,"Passable It was in close proximity to train station and city centre. Also, was clean. I had upgraded to a King-size room. However, it transpired upon my asking questions to reception, that the upgrade, was just the bed size, not the room size. The bathroom was very small and compact, in fact, I could touch both sides with my arms outstretched, and the King-size bed, made the main room feel even smaller! Also, car parking at £16 a day was expensive."
1729,Stacey,2021-08-24,It was ok. I did have higher expectations of the Hilton brand which unfortunately were not met The location of the hotel was good Parking was quite pricey. When I checked in I informed staff I would be keeping my car in the car park my whole stay and was told this was not going to be an issue. While out one day. I received a call from a member of staff asking me to move my car as there were tree surgeons in the car park. I said I could not as I was out and asked why I was not informed the night before. I received quite a rude response from the member of staff and raised it with reception on my return. While I received an apology it did not take away from how I felt.
1730,Wendy,2021-08-20,Exceptional I enjoyed my stay staff were very helpful and friendly rooms were spotless and it was not to fare from town centre x

1734,Ben,2021-08-11,Exceptional I liked what the room provided such as it was a good size and the lay out was good. It was good size TV on the room and also that there was an iron and ironing board provided in the room was something.which no other hotels I have experienced before have ever provided. . Based on where there was no room service provided whilst there it would of been better if there was a bit more coffee and tea sachets provided on the room to last longer for the period as there was no room service to top them up through out the time there .
1735,Kimberley,2021-08-10,"Exceptional Lovely view, fridge in room, ironing board, hair dryer. Large bed. Good base for the city. Bathroom was quite small"

1742,Lynda,2021-08-03,Pure luxury The Hilton is the perfect hotel. From the friendly staff to the most amazing cooked breakfast. The one and only minor downside is the cost of parking when it is clearly land owned by The Hilton
1743,Martin,2021-08-01,"Passable Very little Terrible ""covid"" policy - nobody cleans rooms !!!! Only after checkout!!"
1744,Hannah,2021-08-01,Great location and staff but bad nights sleep due to hard mattress Staff were great . Clean hotel good location The bed / mattress was far to hard . It felt like the floor
1745,Andrew,2021-08-01,"Disappointing Location is decent. £180 for a tiny room, with dated furniture, stains on the curtains, and limited room facilities. This is a hotel charging twice the price it should. I've stayed in Hilton's all over the world and it's normally a sign of quality, but here they charge quality prices but do not deliver."
1746,Nicola,2021-08-01,Fantastic Hotel Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Facilities were lovely and clean and breakfast was outstanding with plenty of choice. Great location near to St Nicholas Market and local high st shops. Plenty to do in the area The sat nav takes you to the front of the hotel where there is no entrance if travelling by car. Rear entrance is not easily found.
1747,Joel,2021-07-31,"Superb location, excellent hotel and great staff 5 mins walk from Temple Meads Station and about the same to get down to the riverside with the plethora of bars and restaurants. Check-in slightly delayed but would appear to have been a booking.com issue but soon resolved and we were in the room. We had a Queen room, nice view, very clean and tidy and the air con was nice and cool! We had a few drinks sat outside in the sun and were served superbly by Leonardo and Carla, very attentive, always looking if we needed another drink and were super quick in getting drinks as well. Leonardo has a cracking sense of humour and made the stay complete! We will be staying here again 5* Nothing, this hotel is excellent!"

1752,Emma,2021-07-28,"Great location The hotel is 7 mins walk from the station and about 15 mins from the shopping centre. The staff are super friendly and welcoming. As someone who doesn’t look well off (and I’m not!), Hilton’s are quite fancy for me so I was worried that I may get judged as I have in some places but nope, super friendly staff and they told me about their Hilton Honors programme so I could check in early (I arrived 3 hours before check in). I would highly recommend the hotel. The location is perfect (it’s next to a small park too), the staff are nice, room is clean, bed is comfy! I arrived at breakfast 30 mins after they opened and the “hot” food was a little cold. They are kept warmed but was surprised at how cold it was considering I wasn’t there much after opening. But saying this, there is a decent amount of choices, hot food (eggs, sausages - everything for a fry up. Waffle maker, toast, yoghurt, fruit, pastries, cereal. There is also lots of drink options (coffee machine with takeaway cups), juices and water. Also (not the end of the world), but the TV didn’t have many channels but was told there would be cable TV. Also couldn’t access the TV guide so had to flick through to see what is on. It would have been helpful to have a note on channels and also how to order room service (and a menu). Overall, these cons are very minor but would be nice as improvement. I would still stay here again."
1753,Regina,2021-07-27,"Great stay We went to Hilton right after our wedding ceremony. They kindly upgraded us to a better room and gave us complementary drinks. Excellent staff and location, highly recommended!"
1754,Kulendrarajah,2021-07-25,Passable Good location Room was quite expensive for what was offered
1755,Sarah,2021-07-25,Next time i will find a hotel with guaranteed parking and possibly no hen/stag parties staying The service at breakfast was very good and the food was also very good. Reception staff were very helpful and friendly. A softer mattress. A tv controller that worked properly (the channel guide button did not work). The noise made by the youngsters in the corridor at 3/4 am when they were returning from their evening out. Signs giving directions to hotel and car park. Not being able to park my car.

1763,Gilda,2021-07-16,Perfectly perfect. The location was quite close to the main venues. The room and the breakfast were outstanding. We particularly liked the stuff's behaviour and the super hygiene left when we entered in the room! Definitely worth to visit this place once in life. Maybe the parking should be increased with more tickets for visitors as it is a 4 stars hotel.
1764,Paul,2021-07-15,"Excellent all round accommodation and staff Staff all polite and friendly. Extremely helpful and went the extra bit. Example, our taxi was late and hotel staff kept chasing on our behalf. They also phone the restaurant to update date them so our booking did not get cancelled.

Uncomfortable beds very low budget. Very noisy - can hear others slamming doors and drunk people outside despite ‘ garden view room’. Extremely poor quality self service breakfast. Overpriced for what it is.

Mini fridge in the room, save, ironing board and iron, hair dryer, heating in bathroom, working and massive TV, good WiFi signal, hand sanitizers everywhere you go, location was great.

The hotel is adjacent to our offices in Bristol and is my preferred location for its location, facilities and parking. The staff were outstanding from the moment I arrived till my departure. I specifically applaud the chef and restaurant staff at breakfast. As ever, all the reception and front of house staff were welcoming, unfailingly courteous and patient.. The team exceeded expectations. Nothing could be better it was excellent, and a delightful return to one of my favourite business hotels."

1798,Kirsty,2021-05-06,"Disappointing for the money spent The staff were very helpful, and it was great to be able to use the gym (they had a booking system for one person at a time). After staying in other 4* hotels in Bristol's city centre I feel this was not good value for money. The room was smaller than others I had stayed in - which is fine, but the bathroom was TINY. You didn't even have room to dry yourself after a shower! I'm also highly disappointed with the amount I had to pay for parking. For 5 days this essentially cost me an extra £100. There are hotels in Bristol offering free parking so feel ripped off. Food was also disappointing, though I did only have room service on one occasion."

Astronomic car park price for one short night. Only advised of excessive charge in email 3 days prior to stay. Would have book another hotel further out if I had known at time of booking."
3002,Tamsin,2024-04-30,"Superb Shower excellent, room was lovely, comfortable and quiet!"
3003,Juliet,2024-04-30,"Hotel staff excellent, rooms comfortable but overpriced meals and drinks on top of expensive rooms. Proximity to the airport. Comfort and cleanliness of the rooms. Drinks and food overpriced. Plastic dispensers for breakfast buffet eg storing bacon etc Cooked breakfast either looked tired or lacked components"
3004,Anna,2024-04-30,Staff as helpful and pleasant as possible though Given how new the hotel is and the price I was surprised by how worn and dirty some things were.Like seating in restaurent area and chairs in room The shower was backing up the drain. It would be good given the long ramos up to the terminal for an 80 yr old to pull a suitcase for trolleys to be available at the hotelI got one the night before and brought it down - a palaver
3005,Jane-anne,2024-04-28,"Very convenient comfortable hotel perfect for the tired traveller Clean room, comfy bed and good quality sheets and towels. Spotlessly clean bathroom. Adequate room size. No complaints. Breakfast had a good choice. Staff went out of their way to assist. We were quite happy with everthing"

3008,Rupert,2024-04-28,"Superb The location was great, the breakfast had everything you would want, and check out time was good. Perhaps a small fridge in the room would be good."
3009,Patricia,2024-04-28,"Good Room and bed very comfortable Location for airport excellent. Food. Breakfast just OK, bacon dried out at 7 am Evening meal , poor selection and what I ordered was cold and had no flavour."
3010,Simon,2024-04-28,"Clean & Comfy but take your own food!! Clean, Modern, comfortable Restaurant and Menu! Third time I’ve been here. It’s the start of your holidays. At least provide a decent menu so we can start off as we mean to go on!"
3011,Charlotte,2024-04-27,"Very good Really well managed hotel with good processes in place to make guests stay comfortable. The staff are the stand out attribute, clearly great training takes place and the staff were extremely helpful, and a real asset to the hotel. The breakfast could be improved significantly. The dinner menu whilst good variety, the quality of the food has room for improvement. The desk chairs in the room were sticky, I think it’s from the type of material they are made from."
3012,Betty,2024-04-26,"Our stay helped us to recharge ready for our long drive home. After a long flight during the night, the hotel was much appreciated and the member of staff that greeted us was most helpful and welcoming. Decor of our room and public areas looked dated and tired."

3019,Mguy61,2024-04-22,"Comfortable, friendly, modern Clean, modern hotel with super friendly staff. Breakfast could have had healthier options. Car parking expensive."
3020,Petr,2024-04-22,Rest before departure Fast check-in and out. Professional and helpfull staff. Room ligtning was very good. Room was clean and beds comfortamble as well as the bathroom was well equipped. Location of the hotel allowed fast access by walk to the departure hall. Thank you for a good stay. Here only to complain a bit abot the size of the room as there was not a good space between table and bed and not comfortable to sit behingd the table.
3021,Ben,2024-04-21,"My Stay at Hamption by Hilton Bristol Airport Hotel is very well located being a couple of minutes walk to the terminal. Staff was very friendly and chatty. Glad they had gym facility, can do some workout on the spin bike or treadmill. The air conditioning system wasn't working in the room I was assigned, had to swap rooms and staff was helpful to sort that issue. I didn't find the bed to comfy, didn't sleep well, it felt a bit hard, in my opinion."
3022,Allyn,2024-04-21,Overnight stay Great rooms Had to move your car after arriving after 1 hr. Right pain especially when it's raining. Needs more choice on menu

3028,Kate,2024-04-19,"Clean, convenient and comfortable. I would stay there again Clean, close to the terminal and better facilities than expected The hotel website does not make it clear that food is available in the evening or that there is a bar so we purchased an M&S picnic which wasted some time for us. You could make that more explicit on your website"
3029,Jane,2024-04-19,"We had a good sleep which was the main purpose for the stay. Very quiet rooms, very comfortable beds and exceptionally clean. The take-away breakfast was poor - very unappetising - but we had no other choice as we had an early departure from the airport."
3030,Graham,2024-04-18,Very good Ideal for its proximity to Bristol Airport for our early morning flight.

Extensive selection of breakfast food and good choices of meals / snacks on other menus. Clean, comfortable room facilities. If rooms with baths are available , I prefer a bath and a shower."
3036,William,2024-04-14,"Good Situation. Room very clean and well appointed. Dinner was good. Poor selection for early risers needing to grab breakfast to go. Only croissants available. Also, room price expensive but balanced by ease of access to airport terminal."

3041,Carolyn,2024-04-11,"Superb All as expected, stayed here numerous times And always had the best service. N/a"
3042,John,2024-04-11,"Fine. As expected. Friendly staff, comfortable room, good breakfast, perfect location The price is rather high for the quality here. It is within easy walking distance of the terminal, so perhaps worth it, but it seems to me they are milking a captive audience. I f you want to stay at Bristol airport, you have to stay here, and you are paying substantially more than the quality would otherwise demand for that. The biggest other problem is that the parking situation is awful. The parking at Bristol is abysmal, and it would be really helpful if the hotel parking was at least competitive, pricewise. Going away for a three or four day business trip, you really want to be able to park at the hotel and pick up your car their upon return. At the current pricing this is not practical,"
3043,Linda,2024-04-11,Had a good stay would recommend Had a continental breakfast was very good More choice for evening meal

3046,Charlotte,2024-04-09,"Lovely, helpful staff, clean comfortable rooms and a great breakfast (and waffle irons!) It was nice, modern and the rooms were lovely, clean and high quality. The room was all ready for us to stay so we just came in and went straight to bed, after a long journey. The bed was quite firm, but that’s just personal preference. The air con in the room was a bit noisy, so we ended up switching it off."
3047,Ian,2024-04-09,Ok Proximity from airport Not enough milk in room
3048,Rebekah,2024-04-09,Very good Food in the evening was a decent standard would have been good if they accepted cash rather than just card.
3049,Diane,2024-04-08,Served its purpose for next day flight Everything Nothing
3050,Nele,2024-04-08,"Comfortable place to stay when arroving late or leaving early Walking distance from the terminal, very friendy staff, clean and good breakfast! No family rooms - we had to book two (adjoining) roms which makes it a little pricy."
3051,Alessio,2024-04-08,Perfect for an early-morning flight. Early breakfast (from 4.00 am) is a great idea ! Wifi was quite fast and stable. 4-minutes walk to the Airport is a great advantage. Price was a bit too high.
3052,Heidi,2024-04-08,Superb Very clean. Breakfast even at 4.30am
3053,Ian,2024-04-06,Convenient and comfortable Very convenient for the terminal. Good continental breakfast at 5 AM. Comfortable room. Quiet
3054,Alison,2024-04-06,"Lovely hotel. Great room and breakfast. Parking pricey I liked the helpful staff at reception. The room is very clean. Bedding comfortable. Tea facility good. No complaints at all. The room was also quiet which is very important to me. Great breakfast too. My only complaint is we had to pay £45 for our car park in the hotel, from approximately 10 pm till 6am. I think it’s expensive tbh. Parking overnight was £45 - too expensive"
3055,Catherine,2024-04-06,"Great location for an overnight stay before your flight Friendly, welcoming staff at reception. Our room was clean and comfortable. Perfect location for an overnight stay before an early morning check in. Breakfast was included."
3056,Leonie,2024-04-06,"Really good Extremely convenient for airport as on site. Very quiet too. Comfortable beds, lovely linen, pillow a bit hard for me but now I’m being fussy! I think if hadn’t got time or timing didn’t work out ,to have breakfast it would be a bit galling to have no option to not purchase breakfast as included in price."
3057,Emma,2024-04-06,"Excellent value for money for early transfers from Bristol airport Easy to find, great accessibility to Bristol airport and super friendly and informative staff"
3058,Jacqueline,2024-04-05,Very satisfactory The proximity to the airport. Clean room and given a ground floor room in view of husband’s walkingdifficulty Nothing really. All was as expected
3059,Dainis,2024-04-05,"Good but expensive option for connection flight for one night. Really close to airport (by walk 3-5 min under roof, it was raining so it helps). Little gym, but nothing to see around. We stay just for overnight and this was ok. Breakfast could be better for this money (we paid 200 eur per night)."
3060,Sales,2024-04-05,Very good  Poor Food Selection
3061,Emma,2024-04-04,"Clean ,comfortable and pleasant Breakfast buffet at 4 in the morning was excellent i I wasn't expecting anything to be open that time,considering we had to be at the the airport at 5 room was clean&comfortable Nothing really but if anything woukd like to see a bit more on the dinner menu as not many options"
3062,Jon,2024-04-04,"Great staff and location, room lovely and clean. Uncomfortable pillows made for restless night. Staff were lovely. Location is brilliant, food and drink were great. We found the pillows very uncomfortable, so didn’t sleep very well."
3063,Angela,2024-04-04,"Good value and great location Check in was fast and good, staff gave all info we needed. room was clean and comfortable. beds very comfortable. morning call was offered. breakfast has plenty of options. no shuttle to the terminal if the weather is bad, works affected the pathway to the hotel"
3064,Indigo_01,2024-04-04,"Very good Stylish, friendly and convenient. Can be a bit noisy still at night due to location."

3066,Chris,2024-04-02,"Best airport hotel ever 😊 Great location, smart clean rooms and amazing staff! All good 👍"
3067,Lorna,2024-04-02,an ideal location when travelling from Bristol airport Nice welcome near midnight and a barman still able to let us buy a whisky... After a long day's travelling. A clean and comfortable room with air con/heating that was responsive. Satisfactory breakfast There wasn't anything
3068,Chris,2024-04-02,Very good Closeness to the airport Finding out that the parking at the hotel was £45 for a night when I was already booked in to the next door multi storey for the following day. I could have just added an extra day to the parking in the multi storey.
3069,Gareth,2024-04-02,Convenient but facilities poor Location and convenience to terminal The bar options and restaurant menu Seating quality in bar/restaurant
3070,Pauline,2024-04-01,Superb Rooms good & breakfast good The performance to pay to get a drink at the bar. Seemed crazy bar staff couldn't take payment and had to go to reception to set a tab up. Price for it was a bit steep as well.
3071,Barbara,2024-03-31,"Great location but painfully expensive for the time I was there. Brand new hotel, nice room, 3 minute walk to airport so perfectly located. The price!!!! You really do have to pay through the nose for the convenience of being right by the airport. But it's not like anyone will be staying for anything other than hours. It would be good if they had a different ptrice structure so that you could rent the room for 12 hours ."
3072,Amber,2024-03-30,"Friendly staff, clean spacious rooms, clarity on suites needed We loved the checking in experience - Cameron was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious, clean and as expected (we booked adjoining interconnected rooms as a family suite). The only issue was the inability to specify that we wanted one room as a,twin instead of a double. We had hoped to put the children in a twin room but instead had to do one parent one child per double bed, which didn't result in great sleep for anyone."
3073,Lauren,2024-03-30,"Perfect for before an early flight Cameron who checked us in was professional and polite, had a lovely friendly manner as he chatted to my family. Breakfast had a good selection All okay"
3074,Janet,2024-03-30,"Easily accessible to the airport, clean and tidy hotel The flight was to early to have breakfast A bit costly"
3075,Barbara,2024-03-30,Couldn't be better under the circumstances of our travel. Friendly and helpful staff. Easy checking in even though we arrived late. Decent breakfast & comfortable room to fall into when arriving exhausted. Thank you. The common seating area could have been better cleaned.
3076,Brian,2024-03-29,"Short but sweet. The first time we stayed at this location, very convenient as our arrival was late. We were impressed. The room was very loved the bed and shower. The breakfast was nice. No decaffeinated coffee in the room."
3077,Brownj13,2024-03-29,"Comfortable, clean and friendly friendly and very central No issues"
3078,Lyn,2024-03-29,handy for the airport so handy for the airport - we dragged off a late flight into the hotel in minutes to catch up with our sleep. The nightime staff on reception were lovely. we weren't sure whether we could eat late so bought sandwiches in the airport before coming over. breakfast is served until 10 - a little later would be helpful given the comings and goings of people using this type of hotel (& the price)
3079,Carl,2024-03-29,Very good So close to airport room and food was great
3080,Gary,2024-03-29,"Excellent location the hotel cleanliness was excellent Location, cleanliness, the room, and food was great. I would certainly use this hotel again. Nothing"
3081,Christopher,2024-03-29,"Ideal for our purposes would be happy to stay there again if flying from Bristol Airport. Very friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast selection even very early in the morning. The room was clean and had everything we needed for our short stay. Proximity to Bristol airport was ideal. Being unable to pay cash for drinks and food."
3082,Stephanie,2024-03-28,Ideal for airport Location excellent. Always clean and comfortable. Lovely quality toiletries and spacious shower with shower head not fixed which is great for washing hair without drowning. Varied buffet breakfast. Dinner available in the evening fortunately as nothing else around and fair price at around £15 for a main. Nice wine stocked too 😂 One odd thing. The bathroom sink is set quite far back in its surround. Have to lean quite far in which is a bit uncomfortable. Be nice to have a magnifying mirror if possible one day.
3083,Andrea,2024-03-27,Well worth taking the stress out of an early flight Perfect
3084,June,2024-03-26,Comfortable hotel marred by parking charge Disgusting price for parking unexplained in website. Would never book again £60 to park in a hotel car park!!!! Rip off parking could never recommend hotel to others
3085,Peter,2024-03-25,"very good, convenient, evening meal disappointing room breakfast evening meal"
3086,Robert,2024-03-25,Convenient stay when flying Very convenient next to the airport when having an early flight. Room was tidy and had everything needed for a one night stay. Quiet and quite comfy beds. The staff at reception the were very pleasant. The breakfast. Ok it is a part of the price you pay when you stay (we paid £154 for one night) but compared to other hotels who offer this I would expect a bit better quality when paying that amount per night. Everything seemed very unhealthily greasy especially the hash browns!
3087,Paul,2024-03-23,Very good Proximity to terminal. All good. The bed
3088,Sean,2024-03-23,"Very relaxing - perfect way to start our holiday Room was quiet, bed very comfortable. Did not have breakfast due to early flight, but had a drink and meal in the bar the previous evening. Drinks and meals were lovely."
3089,James,2024-03-22,"Superb Strategic position, very friendly staff and spacious room with everything you may need. Quite expensive obviously because it’s literally next to the terminal. What I found ridiculous is the 45 £ parking fee for a hotel guest that arrives at 21.00 and leaves at 08.00. That is a total rip-off, the rest is fair overall, including the restaurant and bar (not bad at all)"
3090,Sharon,2024-03-22,Good WE had an early flight so it took the pressure off in the morning as it's a short walk through to the terminal. Basic but good. Food was OK so it was fine for what we needed. Fine for what we needed
3091,Ian,2024-03-22,"Have been previously, and the price has increased, but not the eating experience. The room was fine. The food was overpriced. Chairs somewhat uncomfortable for eating. Lower prices for the standard received."
3092,Madeleine,2024-03-22,Very good Location is very convenient for late arrivals/ early departures. Lovely buffet breakfast A little pricey. The receptionist told us to go to the short stay carpark to get an Uber but Uber told us that we could have waited in the warm hotel as they come in and validate the hotel car park ticket :(
3093,Boothman,2024-03-21,Good We liked the proximity to the airport. Drinks were reasonable prices and good quality drinks. Very friendly staff. Carole and the younger lad behind the bar. Sorry I didn't catch your name. We had a wake up call too as we had an early flight. Also breakfast was served from 4 am which was perfect to grab some coffee before we left. The bar / lounge area wasn't very warm. The food wasn't the best. I only had a toasted sandwich.
3094,Amy,2024-03-21,Easy airport access perfect for young families Perfect location to stay with our toddler before an earlier flight. Breakfast was easy to access and staff were brilliant.
3095,Mary,2024-03-20,"Very good Location , comfortable bed, good shower , well maintained,service was efficient and it ticked all the boxes for catering."
3096,Louise,2024-03-20,"Comfortable hotel to stay in if arriving late, or leaving from the airport early. The location next to the airport was very convenient. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The toom was totally silent so the soundproofing was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The noticeboard for the flights was very useful. The television had no access to Netflix or other apps which was a bit frustrating. The reception and dining area felt chilly, and the decor was too grey and uniform."
3097,Burdett,2024-03-19,Very good Close to airport. Breakfast was good. Room was ideal. Cost of parking
3098,Perkins,2024-03-19,Excellent The staff were very friendly Nothing came to mind
3099,Alessandra,2024-03-18,This is a very good location near the airport I liked the croissants and coffee
3100,Colin,2024-03-18,"Very good Well designed and comfortable room, bed and shower room. Close to the airport so very convenient for our trip to and from Málaga The lunchtime food menu was not good and very little choice for people with allergies. Very expensive also."
3101,Ian,2024-03-18,Superb Location Breakfast Room
3102,Suzanne,2024-03-18,Very good  Unable to open a window due to building work
3103,Josephine,2024-03-18,"First stay, so pleased with the location and accommodation. Clean, modern, comfortable bed, lovely bathroom. Very short, easy walk from departures/arrivals Nothing, perfect for an airport stay"
3104,Kelly,2024-03-17,"Good Staff very friendly with my daughter Food was awful, cheesy chips must of been done in a microwave they were all congealed together, daughter had mac and cheese that had grease running off it"
3105,Caroline,2024-03-17,Airport stopover Perfect location for overnight stay at airport
3106,Brian,2024-03-16,"Have stayed a few times now and always find it comfortable and qiet in roowish we could book direct. Liked room, staff, breakfast. Usually get better price NOT booking direct. Would like better choice for meals and perhaps better presented. Walk from Terminal so far at present (realise the building going on) especially at our age (Seniors) but got assistance to Terminal when leaving."
3107,Bethaney,2024-03-15,"Lovely rooms - eat before you arrive Lovely room, nice clean and comfortable. The staff member who checked us in was lovely. Very close to the airport making it very easy for our 7am flight, expensive for a nights stay however for the convenience it was worth the price. The food. Very expensive poor quality food, had I known it would be the case we probably would have eaten before arrival. £40 for 2 Pepsis, 1 panini and a very tasteless chicken korma. I wouldn’t mind the price had the food been good. The young girl on the bar I dealt with was also quite rude, when I asked if I could pay cash she literally laughed in my face and said “there’s literally a sign right there that says card only” pointing at it. The smallest printed sign on front of the till, no mention of it on the menus. Rooms great, food definitely needs improvement."
3108,Judith,2024-03-15,"Great hotel and great food We have stayed here since it opened , it has a lovely atmosphere It has gone up in price quite a bit"
3109,Jane,2024-03-15,Apart from the works - perfect - staying again! Proximity to airport Unfortunately major works meant a walk around the road which lugging a heavy case was not ideal. Still not far but not ideal when it says its a two minute walk to the airport and in fact maybe six - in the rain!
3110,Michael,2024-03-13,"Nice accommodation, poor food The location of course, right next to the airport We’ve stayed at this hotel several times and the big thing that lets it down every single time is the poor quality of the food. It really is not good. Considering the price of the hotel, it should be much better."
3111,Ann,2024-03-13,Very convenient and glad of early breakfast Location for airport was reason for booking Bath in room
3112,Margaret,2024-03-13,Excellent location for flights with very nice clean and comfortable rooms Clean - location - excellent bed - very nice bathroom - staff were helpful The breakfast breads could be a bit more varied. It’s a solid but not exciting breakfast
3113,Kim,2024-03-12,"Would recommend. Had very early flight, so convenient. Very comfortable and easy check-in/out. There is no undercover walkway and it was raining, arriving and leaving!"
3114,Duane,2024-03-12,Superb easy walk to airport price
3115,Ian,2024-03-12,Pretty well as expected Most of it Supper
3116,Lorraine,2024-03-11,Very good Good hotel and team Dragging bags around due to airport works
3117,Ann,2024-03-11,Very convenient for airport not sure if I’d stay Convenient location. Nice rooms Check in took nearly an hour even with a booking confirmation and was very a stressful process. Staff were quite vacant and service was extremely slow even though it was not that busy. Rooms were very nice but reception area was like a departure lounge. Strange post office style queuing system by the bar. Very expensive.
3118,Jacqueline,2024-03-10,Room styling exceeded expectations. Shower excellent. Lots of pillows. Location good. Would have preferred muesli to cornflakes. Cereal selection
3119,Matthew,2024-03-10,A perfect way to start your holiday. Very close to terminal; clean and comfortable. And no aircraft noise. Exceptionally clean. Very helpful and friendly staff. Maybe a packet of biscuits on the room would be nice.
3120,Alan,2024-03-10,"Complete the covered walk to the terminal and this would be great improvement on a very nice hotel. Very comfortable room, cleanliness excellent, staff friendly and helpfull, although some of the reception staff seemed a little inexperienced. Location very good. Meals (breakfast and dinner) satisfactory. The sliding door on the toilet/shower room (there would have been room for a conventional hinged door). On opening the door to the toilet, it covered the wardrobe access. A big problem was the lack of a full covered walkway to the airport terminal. Only about one third was covered and we were soaked after the 2-3 minute walk."
3121,Gillian,2024-03-10,Would book again Free breakfast was good. Sadly on the outward journey early banging from building works
3122,Philip,2024-03-09,Good Checked in and was given a key to a room already occupied. Complained and got a free dinner. Went to the bar later and paid £15!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for a large scotch. The price of a large scotch
3123,Helen,2024-03-09,"Very handy for the terminal building Convenient, clean & good facilities Expensive"
3124,Ian,2024-03-09,Good Excellent and friendly staff Evening meals are basic but that's probably fine for an airport hotel.
3125,Barbara,2024-03-08,Good location Location Long walk from the hotel to the airport pushing a heavy suitcase. Please install a more direct route so people do not have to walk all the way around the car park.
3126,Roy,2024-03-07,Overall very good. Room Staff Shower drain seemed to be partially blocked
3127,Svitlana,2024-03-06,Comfortable and quiet hotel in convenient location Despite being so close to the airport it was very quiet in the room . Comfortable beds so had a good few hours sleep before our flight . Early breakfast . A bit pricey for one night stay .
3128,Nick,2024-03-06,Good Location Cooked breakfast is poor quality
3129,J,2024-03-06,Good and would use this hotel again when next in Bristol Great Location and lovely room Nothing
3130,Ann,2024-03-05,"Comfortable overnight stay in perfect airport location Location, comfort, and professional and friendly staff. Breakfast - vegetarian sausages were horrible. Linda McCartney or Richmond meatless sausages are far superior and inexpensive. No soya milk."
3131,Margaret,2024-03-05,Very comfortable well located hotel. Well situated for early morning start. Modern well equipped comfortable room Bit pricey
3132,Ian,2024-03-04,Superb Breakfast Room Atmosphere in bar Proximity to Bristol Airport terminal building
3133,Ruth,2024-03-04,Very good Convenience to departures. Nice breakfast from very early. Clean quiet room Nil
3134,Byron,2024-03-04,Value for money hotel located close to airport Hotel was very clean and all staff I spoke with professional & friendly Due to the on going building works the walk to the hotel from airport following the directions along the road was much longer than expected and would suggest difficult for older travellers. Cash not being excepted to pay for food and drinks was a surprise.
3135,Blin,2024-03-03,Very good all
3136,Andrea,2024-03-03,Good location Location for airport. Asked for a lower room as don't use lifts and was offered an easy access room. The room turned out to be a fully disabled room which had a very clinical smell and having stayed here before was not up to the normal standard. Arrived late and decided to have a drink in the bar but sadly none of the tables had been cleaned. The staff were removing glasses from tables and leaving notices on them asking people to bear with them until they wiped the tables Couldn't really understand why this couldn't be done at the time of clearing
3137,Lisa,2024-03-03,Really good. Proximity to airport. Comfortable Good facilities The bar seemed slow and badly organised
3138,Jan,2024-03-02,Ok Close to airport Very poor menu
3139,Maria,2024-03-02,Ok Its convenient for the airport Price a bit high. And a glass of wine is costly
3140,Angela,2024-02-29,Very good On the airport. Decent breakfast. Staff helpful and friendly. Bed quite hard. Room was cold on arrival and heating had been turned up high to get it warm but then would be too hot - the temperature on the thermostat did not seem to be working properly. Shower not very hot.
3141,Jill,2024-02-29,Ok Location Restaurant?
3142,John,2024-02-29,Ok Modern and clean Uncovered access from airport to hotel
3143,Peter,2024-02-28,Good for travellers using the airport Early breakfast from 4am with hot breakfast from 6pm. Limited choice of menu for evening meal. Thought hotel price was a bit high.
3144,Neal,2024-02-27,"Brilliant airport location Excellent stop over for flight from Bristol. Continental breakfast was fine for a very early flight. Very quiet, clean and comfortable. Staff very helpful."
3145,Julia,2024-02-27,Great peace of mind & relaxing start when taking an early flight. Great choice of breakfast at very early time With the problem of access to hotel currently limited to door from carpark only. When you have a heavy suitcase & you are over 65 there should be some sort of shuttle offered to reach airport . It’s a steeper & longer climb than from the front door.
3146,Beverley,2024-02-26,Breakfast fruit was off. Surfaces in the bedroom had not been wiped properly. Staff were excellent. Still feels new. Reasonably well maintained. Location
3147,Aneeta,2024-02-26,Fab stay as rooms were great. Great beds and pillows were comfortable. Food was great and beds were super comfortable.
3148,Sarah,2024-02-25,"Very pleasant airport hotel Staff were extremely helpful, very comfortable generally, Breakfast was good and it was all surprisingly nice for an airport hotel. Evening food prices were reasonable. Evening food was ok but not oustanding."
3149,Rosalind,2024-02-25,Served the purpose after a late flight arrival Convenience; quiet
3150,Paul,2024-02-25,"Friendly staff, clean room and good breakfast Breakfast was excellent. Only having one comfy chair in the bedroom"
3151,Michael,2024-02-25,Convenient (usually) and comfortable Everything No shuttle service to the airport terminal which is more important during the building works as the walkway is closed. Took us 20minutes pushing 3 suitcases up a long hill in the rain at 4am
3152,Gerard,2024-02-24,Clean comfortable hotel close to airport. Staff very attentive. Close to airport
3153,Ana,2024-02-23,Very good It is just next to the terminal !! Very handy !! Very comfy travelling with children !!!
3154,Chris,2024-02-23,"Great for early starts at the airport! Friendly staff, great location and quiet rooms despite proximity to the airport Food selection was fairly limited, and also a little utilitarian"
3155,Katherine,2024-02-23,"The best option for overnight at Bristol airports Easy to reach from the airport, very clean and well equipped room ."
3156,Sandra,2024-02-22,Good Convenient for airport. Evening food was not good with a very processed limited menu.
3157,Andrew,2024-02-22,Easy access to airport Easy access to airport Lucily we had parking already in the Airport as it was £55 per night at the hotel Road works made access not so easy
3158,Richard,2024-02-22,Very good Ideal for early morning flight A long walk due to building work around hotel
3159,Vicki,2024-02-21,Very good Location Very cold
3160,Eileen,2024-02-21,Early flight so good to have a nice room and breakfast. Good sized room Bathroom door did not close properly.
3161,Tracey,2024-02-21,Great location for the airport but disappointed at the additional parking charges The location The outrageous parking charge!
3162,Debbie,2024-02-21,Perfect Perfect location for travelling from the airport Nothing
3163,Jon,2024-02-21,Convenient and suitable for a short rest between flights Quiet and comfortable room
3164,Merilyn,2024-02-21,"So so convenient for an early bird flight. I travel to Jerez de la Frontera regularly to do flamenco classes with teachers there. Not exactly leisure nor work. It’s a long journey and to save time and money I invariable catch a very early flight. I can then travel on from Malaga to Seville and then Jerez. The hotel stay makes that possible and I can leave the car in the Silvee parking and go to bed in comfort. The breakfast in the morning is a bit grundgy - but I do have a particular diet (no dairy milk, no factory bread, only organic). It is included with the price though. This time we had to take a long detour walking to avoid building work. Never mind all wirth it. The staff are great. The rooms excellent."
3165,Stroud,2024-02-21,"Overall worth booking if you’ve got an early flight. Good facilities and no noise considering so close to airport. Very clean, great staff. Convenient for airport Quite expensive."
3166,Kim,2024-02-20,On the whole ok for one night breakfast was very good Very clean and beds very comfortable Very disappointed with the evening meal from restaurant. Jacket potato was rotten on the inside on one meal and lettuce stale and brown on the other meal both had to be sent back and changed
3167,Mike,2024-02-20,Superb Location and modern styling of the decor
3168,Kerry,2024-02-20,Convenient for Bristol Airport. This is a convenient hotel for the airport. The rooms were good. They were quiet and the beds were comfy. The shower was good. Handy to get food and drinks in the hotel. Free breakfast. It will be better when the building work is completed so you're closer to the airport and don't have the slope. It is quite expensive. We didn't get breakfast as were leaving extremely early so would prefer to not have to pay for it.
3169,David,2024-02-20,Superb Very comfortable room breakfast was excellent for early departure of our flight Not really anything
3170,Julie,2024-02-20,Great value with complimentary breakfast Excellent proximity to the airport Not the hotels fault but building work being done started at 8am so early wake up call after a late flight
3171,Sutherland,2024-02-19,"Comfortable, good breakfast. Clean and comfortable Expensive for what it is, not great value for money. Probably because it’s near an airport"
3172,Jeffrey,2024-02-19,We enjoyed the stay although I thought we could have parked there as we on stayed there that night as a result of me goi The property was good The property was good and we would stay again
3173,Sean,2024-02-19,"A review Bed was comfy, staff where nice and friendly. The food was nice."
3174,Andrew,2024-02-19,"A lot of money for a couple of hours sleep.otherwise excellent location and staff Location Parking Technology failed getting in and out, had to sit and wait. Had to pay for breakfast, we were unable to have due to flight time. There should have been a reduction. We got drenched getting to airport as walk way closed, not sure why, from hotel to other carport did not effect hotel."
3175,Patricia,2024-02-18,"Great. Will stay again. Location, breakfast starts at 4am this is perfect. Great facilities. 5 minutes walking distance from airport. Staff not very friendly."
3176,Mike,2024-02-18,"Ok, functional. Couldn't have cooked breakfast because I had to leave at5.30 ok. Evening meal."
3177,Stephen,2024-02-18,"Great location and friendly staff, comfortable quiet room. Really like this hotel, great location and really good staff - friendly and helpful. Nice, quiet room, comfortable bed, slept well. The dinner food was not very good and expensive for what it was. We got absolutely soaked walking round the pedestrian diversion around the work on the extension."
3178,Andrew,2024-02-18,Would stay again Access to airport Expensive for one night no pRking
3179,Linda,2024-02-17,Very good Within walking distance to airport
3180,Tina,2024-02-17,"Ideal for what we Needed , wish we could of stayed a bit longer to enjoy Hotel More . So Close to Airport will Definitely be Booking again when we Travel , Very Clean , Didn’t have Time for Breakfast as we Traveled Easy wax offered a Continental Breakfast but was Booked into Lounge at Airport so can’t Comment on That , Made out Travel a Delight 😀 Very Friendly , Close to Airport"
3181,Irene,2024-02-17,"Very good The restaurant and bar,and room"
3182,Peter,2024-02-16,Enjoyed it Superb location Only downside was covered subway from terminal to hotel was closed you had to walk through car park
3183,Angela,2024-02-16,"Great sleep Comfortable clean rooms, well equipped. Good selection at breakfast. Queue at the bar for food & drinks, slow process. Coffee machine not working at breakfast."
3184,Abbie,2024-02-16,"Comfortable beds but Noisy acoustics! Nice, clean and comfortable stay. Noisy acoustics! Could hear other oriole upstairs moving around til early hours!"
3185,Annette,2024-02-15,easy but quite a challenge to park convenient location terrible parking arrangements and second bed was a sofabed
3186,Annette,2024-02-15,"convenient, easy convenience second bed was sofa bed"
3187,Paul,2024-02-14,Excellent location Location and ease of getting breakfast. Nothing
3188,Victor,2024-02-14,Good location nice hotel Location and nice room The entrance from the bus was closed so I had to walk completely around the hotel. Also could not get a VAT receipt even though Booking. Com said air could get a receipt if I asked for it at reception. Reception said they could not issue one and I had to ask Bookjng.com
3189,Alfred,2024-02-14,"A lovely stay in a very comfortable and convenient hotel Breakfast and previous evening meal were excellent. Room nice as was the ensuite Location slightly spoiled by the sink hole closing the shortcut to / from the airport - particularly Shan I walked the long detour to the hotel, in the dark,not knowing where I was going. It was both tiring and a little scary. Had I known beforehand - eg by text - then I could have planned"
3190,Andrea,2024-02-13,"Clean and comfortable, will use again. Clean and comfortable, staff were friendly Bit of a palaver getting into airport with the building works that are happening, I am not very mobile so it was a bit of a slog. Very long hair on one of the plates our food came on."
3191,Chris,2024-02-13,Great for convenience It was conveniently situated Its facilities were typical of a transit hotel
3192,Toby,2024-02-13,Superb Great hotel when making an eaeyl flight or arriving home late. It's just outside the terminal. The footpath was closed this stay so had a walk around the car park to get to terminal but not a big issue.
3193,Heather,2024-02-12,Good 2 large single beds with generous duvets. Toiletries provided. Self service breakfast ok. Room was cool and heating did not help. Only 1 hook in bathroom for clothes or damp bath towels. Construction work going on outside the wing we were in. Drilling started at 8am
3194,Susan,2024-02-12,Very good Breakfast Room was freezing when we arrived. Took us a couple of hours to warm up
3195,Cazzaj16,2024-02-12,Superb Staff were very friendly on check-in and check-out. Can't hear anything from outside within the rooms so was very quiet (we were not airport side). Breakfast was lovely and bed super clean with a nice mattress Pillows too soft but that's just my preference. Cutlery for breakfast had water stains and hadn't been polished
3196,Christine,2024-02-11,It was perfect for our necessity to be near to the airport Convenient
3197,Leanne,2024-02-11,Good Lovely and clean That’s the side entrance was closed and we had to walk all the way around in the pouring down rain was soaked when we got to airport would have been nice to be told this

3200,Esmé,2024-02-09,Superb Convenient for early morning flight check-in. No warning that hotel footpath was deviated from the terminal due to ongoing works and in pouring rain arrived wet and with wet luggage.
3201,Carl,2024-02-09,"Very enjoyable, would definitely recommend to others. Breakfast was very good, evening meal also very good, staff excellent."
3202,Roderick,2024-02-09,Good Clean comfy bed. Menu choice. Poor access to terminal - use of transport was helpful. Poor ventilation options. AC noisy

3204,Gwyneth,2024-02-08,Just ok. Proximity to airport. Breakfast. Complications with reception. Parking charges. Lack of cosy atmosphere.
3205,Sheila,2024-02-08,A really good place to stay if you have an early flight Proximity to the airport. Helpful staff. Comfortable room. Very good breakfast even at 4am The bar menu food was not great. No/one in our party was really impressed with what they ordered. My cheese sandwich has such a this slice of cheese in it you could barely taste it. Bar area was also a little chilly.
3206,Migueljk,2024-02-08,Comfortable and relaxing All round great stay. Nothing to dislike
3207,Paul,2024-02-07,"Excellent choice for stop over before flying out of Bristol Airport or when returning. Well organised and good food for the type of hotel. Dinner ends at 10pm so a bit disappointing if you have a late flight we arrived at just after 10pm and dinner was finished. However, they do offer a room service with a limited menu."
3208,Godelieve,2024-02-07,"Staying there again for comfort and hope the restaurant will improve Cleanliness, comfort, very comfortable bed and pillows, quiet and a walk away from the terminals The food is not to the standard of the hotel at all. Very disappointing."
3209,Simon,2024-02-07,"Great way to start your holiday Great location, friendly and helpful team 👍"
3210,Nicola,2024-02-06,Very good Location Tap water in the toilette smelled funny. I forgot to report to the reception

3217,Julie,2024-02-04,1 night preflight Clean comfy beds close airport. Food poor qualiity ..room small as i paid extra queen..but more like a double..very expensive overall
3218,Robert,2024-02-02,"Great location - but park in Silver Zone not in the hotel car park! Excellent location, walking distance from airport Very expensive parking. In the end I parked in Silver Zone 12 hours early and paid them an extra £15 instead of the overnight £45 quoted by the hotel."
3219,Chris,2024-02-01,It was ok VERY CLOSE TO AIRPORT FOOD WASNT ALL THAT NICE AND IT WAS EXPENSIVE
3220,Paula,2024-02-01,It was very convenient it was a bit pricey Very close to airport It was cold in our room and thermostat want working

3222,Lynne,2024-01-31,Excellent choice for easy early morning flight. Close proximity to multi storey car park and airport building. One hour free parking for check in and luggage drop. Friendly helpful staff. Good evening meal. Early continental breakfast buffet excellent!
3223,Nigel,2024-01-30,"all good thanks - just what we needed proximity to the airport good breakfast included direct access from the airport. the access was closed due to ""weather problems""!"
3224,Philip,2024-01-30,"Convenient and comfortable hotel. Brilliant location for access to terminal buildings. Excellent sound proofing - considering it is at an airport, there was no exterior noise at all."
3225,Samantha,2024-01-30,Very convenient and while not cheap was worth it for the early start and the staff were very lovely A really big room which was great as we had ski bags and large suitcases. Everything was clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Plus breakfast started at 4.30 so we managed to eat something before our early flight. I didn’t realise it was included in the price! Work by Bristol airport meant we couldn’t walk as easily as usual to the terminal but that was not the hotels fault. Trolleys for luggage would have helped
3226,Angela,2024-01-29,Very good Very clean - great proximity to airport Nothing
3227,Wendy,2024-01-29,Definitely stay again. Left too early Small niggles...TV unplugged and socket hidden. No decaf coffee. No non dairy milk in room.
3228,Iryna,2024-01-29,Very good  There are no connectors for charging gadgets. Add to number. thank you
3229,Michel,2024-01-28,Very good  Room wa a bit cold
3230,Ceri-ann,2024-01-28,Superb Good food. Nice and quiet. Walk to the terminal. It was expensive for one night.
3231,Jackie,2024-01-27,"Good  We had the burger and chips and it's the worst burger I have ever had totally tasteless, shame on you hampton by hilton"

3233,Colin,2024-01-26,Superb location to airport and breakfast all good
3234,Martin,2024-01-25,"Superb The bar staff working on the 24th were excellent, polite and efficient, even though they struggled opening a new bottle of rum. The good was served quickly and was just the right amount."
3235,Mary,2024-01-25,"Last minute booking Last minute booking in airport hotel The bed was very comfortable and a good size. The staff were efficient and welcoming. It was a filthy wet night so understandably wet leaves had been brought in on people's shoes, but they were still there in the morning. No vegan/ vegetarian options for breakfast"
3236,Lynda,2024-01-25,"Very good Nice clean,polite man on reception, although breakfast was continental was pleased with it Giving me a room that wasn't cleaned and tv chanel were poor for a English hotel when I got the second room was satisfied"
3237,Steve,2024-01-25,Family night stop over It’s always great to stay here the night before travelling The staff are always amazing And the food and facilities are pretty good also No waffle machine
3238,Sta,2024-01-25,Quiet & convenient Great location for access to the airport. The room was quiet & clean. Breakfast options were good.
3239,Ray,2024-01-25,"Served a purpose. Breakfast was well organised and delivered. Nice. Exit to airport terminal closed. Restaurant was disappointing, limited choice, but chosen meal acceptable. Side order forgotten."
3240,Jenny,2024-01-24,"Absolutely fine and the croissant were really good The hotel is clean and comfortable. Croissant at breakfast were good. The rooms are comfortable. The price I think is high for what is basically a upmarket Premier Inn. However, it is the only hotel by the airport so I can fully appreciate why there is a premium. We chose to pay the price as my husband had an early flight and we wanted to be as close as possible to the airport. We could have stayed at the Clifton Gorge Hotel Du Vin for the same price which would have been much more of a 'special' stay but as we basically just wanted a bed for the night this was fine. It is a hotel that offers what it says it will do. The staff member I dealt with at check-in was very friendly and helpful. Very small thing but I was surprised that there was only standard tea or coffee sachets in the room. I would have liked a green/peppermint/ or something similar before going to bed."
3241,Paul,2024-01-23,"Very convenient to Bristol airport, excellent location, great facilities and great people. Great location and spotlessly clean Very little to dislike, it was perfect for our overnight stay before travelling on."
3242,Tom,2024-01-22,Perfect for an early flight. Perfect for an early morning flight Nothing
3243,Marta,2024-01-21,"Fantastic option if you need to take an early flight The location couldn't be better if you need to take an early flight in the morning. It's right next to the airport. I have stayed in this hotel twice and both times the rooms were very nice and comfortable. I find the price quite expensive, considering that both times I booked was to be able to take an early flight in the morning, so I didn't feel like I had much time to enjoy the rooms or the complimentary breakfast."
3244,Neil,2024-01-21,"Superb Close to the airport, clean, nice big beds"
3245,James,2024-01-21,"comfortable and very convenient for airport--walkable. good breakfast, comfortable room, very convenient to airport choice of food in evening not very inspiring."
3246,Raymond,2024-01-21,Good hotel but as with all airport hotels slightly over priced Great location 5 min walk from terminal Food was very average
3247,Jane,2024-01-20,"Good hotel, ridiculous overnight car park charge Extremely convenient for early morning flight out of Bristol airport The new car park charge which was an eye watering £45 overnight! Even though we booked before this came in it was still applied. Would not stay there again for this reason"
3248,Martyn,2024-01-19,"It's ideal to fly. Food fine but self service. Great breakfast. Rather expensive. This is an airport hotel in a great position. Food was fine. It does the job. It was quite expensive because its onsite. You get up and walk to the terminal. Self srevice in an expensive hotel. Got to get up and queue every time yiou or anyone in your party wats another course or drink. It does the job but its not part of the holiday,"
3249,Richard,2024-01-19,Splendid Very convenient for Bristol Airport Nothing I can think of
3250,Tracey,2024-01-18,Very convenient for Airport Close to the airport Ideal for early flight Staff very friendly and helpful Had lots of puzzles and books with crayons for children which was great as I was with my 2 year old granddaughter Arrived at 7pm Really busy in the restaurant seemed short staffed and lots of food not available So had to settle for a pizza
3251,David,2024-01-17,Good Ok Facility outside the Hotel getting to the airport
3252,Michelle,2024-01-17,Superb very helpful lady on reception - apologies i didn't get her name
3253,Clive,2024-01-16,"Very good Breakfast good but would have liked hot option, we were too early.needed h Needed hot option for breakfast the only thing we were unhappy with but it would not stop us staying again.convenient for flight comfortable room ."
3254,Yvonne,2024-01-15,"Very good  Could do with better parking facilities, perhaps the option to leave and pick up on return if on the same day"
3255,Shepherd,2024-01-15,"Very good Location to airport, clean and comfy Too expensive room rate , no fried eggs at breakfast"
3256,Merilyn,2024-01-15,Decent food and very convenient for air travel. It is SO convenient for early flights from Bristol airport.
3257,Michelle,2024-01-15,Lovely stay nice staff We were going in our honeymoon the next day so the location is very good also staff were very friendly gave us a drink vouchers because we were on our honeymoon Al thou the food was ok think there could be more choice
3258,Alison,2024-01-14,"Overall good, staff a little inexperienced and offish upon first communication Location Nothing"
3259,Ian,2024-01-14,"Ian's stay at Hampton. The hotel was conveniently situated next to the airport, for an early flight to Paris. The shower and bathroom were excellent, and the bedroom was very comfortable. Nothing to report."
3260,Saj,2024-01-14,Staff were friendly and polite. We cannot fault them. Hotel was clean & tidy. I just felt it was all about the money The property was clean & tidy. I felt it was all about the money e.g when I ordered a glass of Prosecco and they took their time because they had to do the exact measurement for it.
3261,Niall,2024-01-13,"Very good Very convenient to the airport Very expensive parking. Not the hotels fault, I believe the rate is set by the Airport"
3262,Gary,2024-01-13,Ok Location Staff not attentive
3263,Sarah,2024-01-13,Very good Breakfast excellent You wouldn't take cash
3264,William,2024-01-13,Made getting to airport less stressful as could get uplater Very good everything near and accessible Nothing
3265,Edwina,2024-01-11,Overnight stay before early flight Great location for early flight.comfortable room and beds.
3266,Gary,2024-01-11,Very good  Evening meal could have been so much better
3267,Christine,2024-01-11,Lovely hotel and friendly staff but rooms could have been warmer as it was a very cold night Good breakfast The duvet was too thin. It was a very cold night
3268,Maria,2024-01-11,"Pleasant and convenient Convenient location, clean and accessible. Good breakfast choices. Lunch and evening meal menus are pretty basic and are like heated up prepared meals rather than fresh cooked."
3269,Pearce,2024-01-10,Good The staff extremely helpful as I had a bad knee gave me a room on lower floor and brought drinks to my table first class. Ever time door leading out to airport opened draught was tiresome when eating. Sorry to say as a ex chef burger was awful dry bun not toasted a crime really shame as menu in my opinion wants living up not one fish dish and to many curries.
3270,Andrew,2024-01-10,I would use a different airport to avoid being taken advantage of due to the lack of competition in Only a 5 minute walk to the terminal. Food was good but drinks were excessively expensive. Just profiteering. Shame on you!
3271,Vix73,2024-01-09,"For one night only Location, food was good. Staff were helpful, polite and friendly. The fact that the hotel did not offer free parking for guests who are staying overnight."
3272,Susan,2024-01-09,Very good Excellent location for flying from the airport. Nice cooked breakfast.
3273,Revey,2024-01-09,. So glad we booked this part of our journey A safe evening chill before an early morning flight Couldn’t access the heating/air conditioning. There again we didn’t ask!
3274,Brendan,2024-01-09,"Ideal for a one night stay pre flight. Location. Walking distance to the airport departure lounge. Clean, safe hotel. It’s a bit bland. The food offering wasn’t great. A bit of a transit feel. Ok for a night but it’s definitely got the one night traveller feel."
3275,David,2024-01-09,First time using a stay at hotel for an early departure which was good. Quiet and cosy room with comfortable bed. More information about packaged breakfast available for early departure would have been appreciated plus quickest route out to airport.
3276,Roger,2024-01-09,"Convenient for a stop over. The location right next to the airport, very convenient. It’s a bit soulless.The bar set up was a bit strange. Served our purpose."
3277,Philip,2024-01-09,"Superb Nbr1 it was next to the Bristol Airport. It was clean and comfortable. Staff were ok. Hit my leg twice on the bedframe! The staff could have been freindlier I think.but over all it was good, the food was fab!!"
3278,Kenny,2024-01-08,Superb staff breakfast

3282,Erin,2024-01-07,Great for early flights Rooms were good size and clean.
3283,Jan,2024-01-06,A bit expensive for what it is but it’s the best option for an early flight. Excellent location for early flight. It was clean and functional. Nothing to dislike.
3284,Lynne,2024-01-04,Feel a tiny bit ripped off by breakfast. Breakfast has clearly been cut back itcwas ok but not worth the outlay. Room was good all fine.
3285,Mike,2024-01-04,"Great place to stay on the way out early or returning later We had an early flight out from the airport the next day, so getting up at 5 am at the hotel was great with leaving two or three hours before this from home. Reception staff were great even had a little breakfast before we left. We would stay there again in the similar circumstances. No problems"
3286,Nicki,2024-01-04,"Good Comfortable room, great bathroom The breakfast was disappointing."
3287,Maria,2024-01-03,Good Priority to airport
3288,Helen-louise,2024-01-03,"Excellent facility when travelling to and from Bristol Airport. Staff and location, great service and nice food. The carpet design. Ugh!"
3289,Giordano,2024-01-02,Perfect for what we needed. Comfortable and spacious room. Excellent shower. Good breakfast. Conveniently located.
3290,Lloyd,2023-12-31,"Superb Every member of staff we encountered were incredibly friendly, helpful and welcoming."
3291,Maria,2023-12-31,"Very convenient for airport, comfortable and friendly staff. Convenient to airport, nice comfy beds. In my view, the basic lunch and dinner food menu lets the hotel down. Curry ‘special’ tastes like a standard supermarket microwave meal. Food always seems like it is just heated up prepared meals and not cooked from scratch. Ok but basic and not very appetising. Even the menu itself is like a piece of laminated card and does not look very professional. I think an improvement to the above will go a long way to promoting the image of a classier hotel."
3292,Hannah,2023-12-31,Functional Location next to the airport
3293,Katherine,2023-12-31,"Excellent receptionist The lady at reception was lovely, very professional and accommodating. Unfortunately I didn't get her name. Parking charge."
3294,James,2023-12-30,Very good Airport Locality Car Park Charge excessive
3295,Alison,2023-12-30,"Friendly, comfortable hotel with value for money Spacieux and comfortable room. Staff friendly and efficient. Breakfast varied and delicious."
3296,David,2023-12-29,Very good Ideal for on airport location with no need for a transfer bus Hotel is low down relative to the departure hall so even with ramps there is a longish haul out in the rain to get into the terminal
3297,Janine,2023-12-29,"Great stay in great location The staff were very efficient, the hotel was clean and comfortable and the fact that they provided breakfast from 4 am was fantastic for those with an early flight The bed and pillows were very firm"
3298,Jennifer,2023-12-28,"Ok, what l 3xoect3d. Breakfast very good. Bit of a limited menu for dinner. Couldn't open my window. Always have my bedroom window open at night even if only just a little bit."
3299,Ian,2023-12-28,Excellent Location. Evening meal. Breakfast. Very minor: no choice of different teas in room and no USB charging points
3300,Suzanne,2023-12-27,"Good Location, cleanliness Bed very uncomfortable and squeaked with movement"

3305,Sophie,2023-12-22,Nice clean friendly hotel The position and the quality of all the furnishings were very high. There were staff there if you needed. Very small choice of drinks in the room with the kettle. No decaf. No usb plugs.
3306,Johanna,2023-12-22,Very good Availability at the last minute due to flight change Good breakfast
3307,Nigel,2023-12-22,Good Pleasant staffat reception. Overrpriced drinks in bar.
3308,Shaun,2023-12-21,Very handy so close to airport but overpriced  Internet was very limited access.
3309,Zemir,2023-12-20,"Good Nice, clean and easy to access from the airport. Arrived a little earlier (before 2pm - which check in time). I was informed to await to 1pm so they will ensure that I can get my room. Came to reception to check in at 1.15pm but suddenly were asked to pay additional fee since I arrived before 2pm (= 20 pounds). Better situation awareness is needed - especially comparing to other Hilton Garden hotel - Birmingham which I stayed same week."
3310,Andrew,2023-12-20,Good location and facilities Convenient location Not much
3311,Joanna,2023-12-19,"Nice room, good location but not without issues. The beds are really comfy, rooms spacious and airy. Lovely bathroom. Breakfast was good. The location couldn't have been any better, literally just across the road from the terminal building. We had an issue with our room when we checked in. I won't go into details but the night manager seemed quite mortified by it. The next day we were given a can of pop and a bar of chocolate each by way of an apology. I think given the nature of our complaint and how much we paid for the room, this seemed a little insulting."
3312,Alan,2023-12-17,"Very good I bought an excellent burger and chips for my evening meal. But more of a choice of a set menu, more formal, evening meal which I would expect from a ""Hilton"" hotel instead of ""fast food"" would have been preferable. Breakfast was good, although the English breakfast could have started a little earlier because of early flights. I could not fault the room, clean and warm and even though just yards from the runway - no noise from aircraft!!! Usually not a hassle to get from the hotel to the departure lounge - but difficult when the site is being upgraded. The only fault I can state is the fact that, even though it was beyond the hotel's control, the area around the departure/arrival terminals were being, so called ""upgraded"". I believe that the hotel could have offered customers a free system for them and their baggage to have been taken to and from the terminals, instead of the 10 - 12 minute convoluted walk, when the walk would usually have taken 2-3 minutes! Wouldn't have been a problem except for the fact it was pouring with rain!! And a taxi for the 500 metre ride was quoted at £15!!!"
3313,Callum,2023-12-15,Very good The friendly staff and it was easy to walk to and from the airport terminal. Air conditioning was to high making sleep a little uncomfortable.
3314,Olof,2023-12-15,Convenient Rooom was cold and unheated Being cold in a premium priced property
3315,Rhiannon,2023-12-15,"Superb Rooms was very clean, very friendly staff and a good variety at breakfast. Family rooms were a bit of a squeeze for 3 people with suitcases."
3316,Jean,2023-12-14,The room was clean and comfortable and the people behind the desks were very helpful Help getting to the airport The decor is a bit dated and the seating in the bar areas were a bit shabby
3317,Tandy,2023-12-14,"OK, marred by check in issues! Proximity to the airport. Daisy on reception at check in was very pleasant and professional. Very rude Duty Manager( ?) at Check in. Think she was called Laura/Lauren? She needs to attend/re attend a Customer Services course!! There were some issues with the hotel card terminal not processing Visa Credit Cards and she did not handle it in a courteous or professional manner, unfortunately."
3318,Peter,2023-12-14,Good Location It's always a little expensive for a very short stay
3319,Almut,2023-12-12,A good stay in an overpriced hotel The hotel is within a few minutes walk from Bristol Airport. I booked it because of a very late arrival in Bristol. The hotel is overpriced and takes advantage of the only accommodation within easy reach of the airport.
3320,Mary-jane,2023-12-11,"Good The nearness to Bristol airport terminal The expensive wine, small main meal and poor coffee"
3321,Louise,2023-12-11,Good location. Download app to make check in quicker Location was good Car park building works made access difficult from main car park. Clearer details of onsite parking would be helpful
3322,Paul,2023-12-10,Perfect The friendly atmosphere
3323,Rhianydd,2023-12-10,"So handy! The staff are really friendly Breakfast is good,plenty of choice Location is perfect, of course The bed wasn't great. Everything my husband turned over,my whole body bounced!"
3324,Peter,2023-12-10,. Good all around
3325,Pamela,2023-12-09,"Comfortable but pricey Location perfect for the flight. Room comfortable. Clean. Food while the basic menu was nice. Reception staff were slow. The restaurant staff disorganised, the wine was not cold. For a Hilton expectations were sadly not meet. They have a captive audience."
3326,Michael,2023-12-08,Short Location Nothing but Premier inn do a proper breakfast and the shower is more powerful and there mattresses are better quality.But as there is no Premier at this location Hampton will have to do
3327,Richard,2023-12-08,One or two issues but otherwise good Very close to the airport You had to pay for the car park & the barrier for the car park is surrounded by curd stones which have a high lip at the ends& if you approach it from the car park at right angles it catches the car skirt as you have to get close to feed your ticket into the machine All under the same post code as the airport so if you are unfamiliar with the area it's awkward to find
3328,James,2023-12-07,"Great location, clean room but your paying for over the odds. The location is great The food was very average. And the price is high! It’s a fancy travel in at best."

3335,Carol,2023-12-01,Good once we found how to get to it. Convenient to airport The pathway to the hotel from the airport was dreadful. The surface was bad for suitcase wheels and the signage was haphazard.
3336,Beverly,2023-12-01,Superb  Not having trolleys available to take multiple cases to airport. Had to walk to airport to find some and then bring them back to load up. No sound on TV BBC1
3337,Elaine,2023-12-01,"Great location for an early flight, but you pay a premium for the location Excellent location for an early flight at Bristol Airport. Room clean, well equipped, comfortable and quiet. Early breakfast available at 4am. Friendly staff. Expensive"

3340,Kevin,2023-11-29,"My review It was comfortable and clean, and the staff were friendly. The car park should be free for guests, the fact it's airport property is a you problem not a me problem and charging excessive fees for parking makes you look very bad 👎"

3347,Anne,2023-11-26,"Due to its location will stay again, but not the 'whow' factor I expected. Easy access to Bristol Airport. Communal seating areas were very impersonal. Thought that for a top rated hotel that the facilities could have been more 'luxutious'."

Allocation of ground floor room as my wife's walking is poor Great that breakfast started at 4am as we had an early morning staff Excellent bar staff Front desk very busy at peak periods Room rather smelly when we first went in AirCon/Heating a challenge Construction at airport meant a long walk with luggage to terminal (this was not the hotels' fault)"
3363,Olaf,2023-11-20,"Comfy and quiet hotel close to airport Close to airport, quiet and comfortable rooms, spacious bar/restaurant Inflexible on booking cancellations, expensive for what is a glorified Premier Inn"
3364,Ann,2023-11-20,"Handy for an early morning flight. Clean, comfortable, easy airport access. The shower wasn’t working properly."
3365,Caroline,2023-11-19,"Great place to stay if you are flying out early in the morning. Good breakfast, beds are very comfortable. The walk across the car park is a bit tricky due to ongoing work."
3366,Susan,2023-11-19,"Very good Staff were very welcoming The walk from the hotel to the tunnel to go to the airport. Was very dark. As a woman on her own, was not good."
3367,Roger,2023-11-19,Ok.  Food very basic eg burgers curry etc. a steak would be good or a salad! Not cheap food but motorway service standard. Most of us off on holiday would prefer something better. And healthier.
3368,Trevor,2023-11-19,"Ideal for a short stay. Close to the airport, The breakfast was really good. Nothing."
3369,Elizabeth,2023-11-16,Convenient but bar very expensive. At the airport but roadworks so long wet walk to departures As above
3370,Paula,2023-11-16,Superb Pleasant and helpful staff member on arrival even though it was 1.30am.. room had everything needed for overnight stay .. great breakfast and lovely staff on check out sign posting from terminal due to construction is poor and needs more lightning .. dark and wet on arrival and was difficult to see how to get to hotel
3371,Frances,2023-11-15,"Very good Handy for the airport, quick food service Extra bed in family room was uncomfortable"
3372,Derek,2023-11-15,Ok as a transient hotel you would not want to stay otherwise Close to airport Current problems with walkway to airport making it harder to drag a suitcase uphill with no reduction in rates due to this issue.
3373,Lesley,2023-11-14,Useful for early departures and late arrivals Close to the airport Because of the building works on the airport the walk from airport to Hotel is longer and uncovered. Not great when you arrive and it’s raining and you have 2 hold bags and 2 cabin bags after a 5 week stay out of the country.
3374,Loveday,2023-11-14,"Great location but food awful Our rooms were booked for the wrong dates by Booking.com - but the Hilton did manage to find us a room for the night and although we didnt get two rooms they did give us one for the 3 of us which was find and didnt charge us, so I was grateful for that. Booking.com messed up and booked us for the wrong nights - so we didnt get the two rooms I had booked - but just one. Our room wasn't that clean (snot on the wall - yuck) but as we were so tired we just ignored it. Food was pretty awful for the price and too early to have breakfast."
3375,Ken,2023-11-13,"Very good hotel at airport, but pity about access pathway diversion due to renovation of car parking. Proximity to airport, early Continental breakfast and standard of facilities. The tortuous path to get to it from the airport building due to the renovations of airport parking. Bathroom has nowhere to hang towels after you shower."
3376,Nicole,2023-11-11,"Fabulous, convenient but expensive Convenience and excellent friendly staff Expensive"
3377,Monica,2023-11-11,Apart from the coffee I liked everything. I liked everything except the coffee machine. I think it would be good to have proper coffee to start the day. Coffee from a machine always tastes awful. I didn't bring a car but I think the car park is too expensive.
3378,Shona,2023-11-10,"One night stay. Thought I would hear planes going in and out, but somehow, no noise! Queing up to register. Had to wait a good while, at registration desk."
3379,Jill,2023-11-09,Helpful staff and convenient Location
3380,Elaine,2023-11-09,"Great overnight stay ready for an early morning flight. Very welcoming, great location very close to the terminal. Room was lovely, bed comfy and bathroom immaculate. Nothing"
3381,Barry,2023-11-08,Comfortable and convenient Close to airport Convenient parking Cost of parking could have been included in price for at least 1 or2 nights. Other hotels give substantial discount or free parking if staying longer than one night
3382,Michael,2023-11-07,Superb Very comfortable Price per room
3383,Kevin,2023-11-07,"Satisfactory. Excellent service from staff, they could not have been more helpful. Check-in was easy. Room and bathroom comfortable and clean. Duvet so thin that I had to put on socks! Cooked breakfast - I would expect fried and/ or poached eggs, not scrambled; neither do hard-boiled ones suffice."
3384,Dawn,2023-11-07,"Great Staff, Clean, Beds need making more comfy xx Staff friendly and proffesional I shared a room with my daughter as we had an early flight. I slept in the sofa bed. It was very hard and uncomfortable."
3385,Carole,2023-11-06,Convenient but expensive Close to terminal Expensive Not much food choice Not even a reduced parking incentive
3386,Ttg,2023-11-06,"Pleasant stay but could do better The reception / checking in personnel were polite and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful and nice seating area and enjoyable. We ate in the restaurant, although limited choices the food was acceptable but nothing special. The room seemed quite basic for a Hampton by Hilton, the bathroom could do with more hooks to hang your clothing, towels and more room to place toiletries on seemed limited on places to put your belongings. The bed seemed small for a king room."
3387,Jayne,2023-11-06,"Superb The location was very convenient, the room was comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful. The only drawback for our stay was that there was a lot of work being carried out in the airport grounds therefore the distance to walk was much further , so less convenient."
3388,Julieta,2023-11-05,Very good Breakfast since 4am One side of the bed kept dropping me out the bed due to bent mattress
3389,Suzy,2023-11-05,One night as very early start at airport. Breakfast from 4 am so able to eat something before we left. Staff very helpfu Close to airport.
3390,Martin,2023-11-05,"Difficult and tricky. All our clothes are soaking. It was refreshing to see everything you needed was there, and the staff were exceptional The problem is that Bristol Airport is undergoing major infrastructure changes and it took over an hour to drive from the main road to the hotel. We then had to do bag drop in the airport and the walk was 10 minutes in pouring rain with no canopy shelter. we had the same journey in the morning to the airport in the pouring rain. We are going on a cruise so had four bags to drag through and made paths. It was very dangerous on the roads approaching the hotel with people resorting to walking in the dark in the rain with no street lights. The car rental place took nearly an hour to get from the hotel to drop off and back again. Had we known this we would’ve stayed somewhere else."
3391,Bruce,2023-11-05,"Good- staff, clean room, pretty good value. Breakfast good. Dinner only fair in my book. Clean The long walk to the hotel from the airport and back. No shuttle service. Cab £42 each way, not good!."
3392,Michael,2023-11-04,So convenient for airport with very early flight. Noted continental breakfast available from 0400.. Room was perfect. Up to expectation. Rather expensive for single occupancy.
3393,Kate,2023-11-04,Would use again if flight time necessitated a stay. Great little airport hotel. Disappointed by poor breakfast - not the best continental offering. No cooked option available until 6am
3394,William,2023-11-03,Atm very poor access The room was excellent so were the staff .breakfast very good We booked the hotel due to the location being very close to the terminal however due to works being carried out its is a nightmare to get to on foot deffinatly not suitable for most people young families elderly or the disabled in particular with no shuttle assistance available which caused myself and wife alot of anxiety which after strenuously complaining to the hotel they did arrange disabled assistance which should have already been in place ..apart from that the hotel is fine in all other respects
3395,Joodles,2023-11-03,"Very good Comfortable, convenient stay very close to the airport building."
3396,Lucy,2023-11-03,"Convenient, clean and a good family breakfast included Location, breakfast, cleanliness We had multiple payment amounts pending in bank. This was resolved within 48 hours but the total was pending 3 times resulting in over a £1000 pending in my bank account"
3397,Joseph,2023-11-03,Great location The location and cleanliness. But the construction works around make the walk quite long.Lovely staff. Sausages undercooked.
3398,Rachael,2023-11-02,"Very good Location to airport, lovely clean and modern rooms"
3399,Kevin,2023-11-01,Relaxing and a great way to start out break Great location ideal for pre flight stay staff friendly and helpful
3400,Claire,2023-10-30,"Apart from the menu, everything was really good and the staff are fantastic and super helpful! Convenient, clean, modern and great staff! The limited menu was not very good."
3401,Lydiarich,2023-10-30,Perfect start for a holiday Convenience to the airport especially for early morning flights
3402,Raymond,2023-10-29,Pricey due to location No breakfast Friendlier staff
3403,Colin,2023-10-29,"Very good hotel - if you can find it nice modern hotel with all the facilities you might want Well the problem for me was getting to the hotel. It's hidden away behind the multistory car park. Because of the work going on at Bristol Airport, you had to follow signs which weren't obvious to begin with!"
3404,John,2023-10-29,Overnight stay for early flight. Location Maintenance works.
3405,Nicola,2023-10-28,Fantastic choice for overnight stay before travel Welcoming staff 🙂. Great atmosphere and fantastic breakfast 👍🏻 Pillows a little hard
3406,Sophie,2023-10-28,perfect apart from we were tired from flight 1.30am so misheard breakfast time😬 location clean very comfortable no fridge breakfast finished at 10am (we thought it was 10.30am so were 7 mins late for breakfast so missed it😭)
3407,Joanne,2023-10-28,Convenient - but not as convenient as my last stay Clean and tidy Building works mean it’s not really an easy walk in the middle of the night and certainly not well lit and signposted. This work is extensive so travellers should be made aware on booking
3408,Olga,2023-10-28,Good option if one has an early or late flight Great location with a possibility to check in any time. Comfortable rooms. Good shower and beds. Very expensive. Breakfast could have been better.
3409,Ada,2023-10-27,"Apart from the debit card problem, the stay was as expected. The room, the staff and the breakfast The evening meal selection. The now extended walk from the airport The fact that my debit card (despite being perfectly valid and used that very evening in the restaurant0 was declined and I had to use a different one."
3410,Mary-jane,2023-10-26,Very good and useful The situation. Friendly staff....clean and welcoming. Good ample breakfast. £9 for a glass of wine!!!! Somewhat OTT...... Wine definitely to be avoided in the future!
3411,Penny,2023-10-26,Our first stay at this hotel Was great. Amazing bathroom and room.was huge for the three of us.
3412,David,2023-10-25,Great if you can find it from the terminal ??? all fine will use again The directions from the airport left alot to desire at one in the morrning having followed the guide ended up in the car park???
3413,Lauren,2023-10-25,"Lovely Staff were excellent, rooms are lovely and the soaps etc provided The path to the hotel from the airport and back to the airport wasn't clear. It was dark when we arrived and left and walked a long road way to get there when extremely tired after flight delays, in the rain, carrying luggage, when it's literally over the road. Clearer signposted paths needed. Some sort of construction was happening so maybe that's what's happening. Left too early to get any breakfast. Would be nice if there was a bagged up to go option"
3414,Sarah,2023-10-24,"Great Closeness to the airport, comfy room, great shower, best breakfast No bar fridge"
3415,Kath,2023-10-24,"Relaxing comfortable stay The location is perfect and we were lucky to be given a ground floor room. The receptionist was excellent, could not have been more helpful. The beds were super comfy and the breakfast was amazing with so much choice The bathroom was clean, but there was a leak coming from something. We were so tired that we just put up with it. I did report it when checking out the next day"
3416,Leo,2023-10-23,"A busy but comfortable hotel doing a good job of managing guests' needs. Evening food was very efficiently provided to a busy room, and it was good quality food. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Room was the quietest I have ever found in a hotel. Location is excellent. Bed was somewhat hard. TV remote broken."
3417,Leanne,2023-10-23,Very good How clean it was very comfortable 😌
3418,Jane,2023-10-23,Ideally situated for airport and comfortable room and helpful staff. Good standards all round. Helpful staff. Not the fault of the property in any way but due to ‘works’ in the airport arrivals area the route from the hotel with large suitcase and cabin suitcase in the rain was not great!
3419,Michelle,2023-10-23,"Very good A lovely hotel, so easy for flying early for holiday! Although a bit pricey. Price"
3420,Kyansenga,2023-10-22,Great for airport connections Good sized room Congestion at meal times
3421,Daniel,2023-10-22,"Good hotel, needs improving in certain areas Location, clean room, friendly staff Price of food is comparable with other hotels, snacks are overpriced to the point of exploitation Breakfast could be better, no brown sauce, no fried eggs, poor quality bacon and sausages. £7 pint served in warm glass so beer flat had to change twice"
3422,Jackie,2023-10-21,"necessary, not by choice  beds were hard, food choices poor expensive food and drinks"
3423,Paul,2023-10-20,"Well functioning, modern, ideally located Great location, very clean and well functioning. Beds and pillows super comfortable You queue for service at bar like your getting school dinner. Did not like this Hotel has no personality"
3424,Andrea,2023-10-19,Very good Reception manned when we arrived in the early hours - friendly staff. A good choice of vegan options at breakfast. All OK thanks.
3425,Laureana,2023-10-19,Very good -close to the airport -reasonable food. Enjoyed the early breakfast. -lovely and helpful staff - No charging plugs in the room. I had to borrow an adapter downstairs because I have spanish plugs on my phone charger. I would expect an airport hotel room to have USB plugs. -My towel in my room was stained with makeup. It had been cleaned but it is not inviting to use a towel that was staines.
3426,Jerry,2023-10-19,"Very good Clean, good breakfast Due to the car park works at the airport the access to the hotel is a much longer distance and is very poorly signposted"
3427,Patrick,2023-10-19,Comfortable and convenient for early morning flight Proximity to airport for early morning flight It was expensive
3428,Christopher,2023-10-19,"Good  Pedestrian access to terminal is very bad. Deviations more than double the required walking distance. Staff excuse that this is the airport not the hotel, shows that the hotel is not doing enough to improve the situation. Staff did not warn that the hotel was “cash free” and we were unable to purchase drinks unless using credit cards. A warning upon arrival is necessary."
3429,Katharine,2023-10-19,Very good Surprisingly pleasant reception area and rooms A bit expensive
3430,Heidi,2023-10-17,"Convenient, clean, quality furnishings, friendly staff Clean, comfortable No USB chargers in the room or biscuits with coffee"
3431,Aisling,2023-10-17,"food was v good and drinks ok price, room just a bit pricey but location excellent location I think it is a bit expensive for a night before a flight"
3432,Georgina,2023-10-17,Good Our second room once we were relocated was fine. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast choices good. Stayed one night due to late flights snd was conveniently close to the airport and bus stands. Not impressed after checking into our room to find the toilet with dried black faecal matter all around the pan. Rang reception and she said she would sort it and hung up. We didn't know if we were meant to wait or go back to reception. After a short time elapsed we rang again to be told it was being dealt with. Then we were were ushered to a room on another floor. No apologies just a excuse that the cleaners make mistakes. Not at all pleasant to walk into after along day.
3433,Coralline,2023-10-17,Very good the waffles the location the staff
3434,Martin,2023-10-17,"Very good, I shall use it again It was a pleasant surprise to be able to get a reasonable breakfast even very early in the morning"
3435,Fleur,2023-10-16,Exceptionally good location. Shame it’s so expensive Location The price!!
3436,Claire,2023-10-16,"Very good Very convenient for the airport, literally a 5 minute walk to the terminal door. Comfortable room, friendly staff. Nice restaurant area, not huge choice but food good. Last time I stayed last year there was a breakfast bag to take away if you were on an early flight which didn't happen this year. Seeing as breakfast is included in the price we felt this was a bit of a con. If you're not going to supply anything then there should be a choice of price with breakfast included or not."
3437,Yvonne,2023-10-16,"Comfortable, clean but expensive Location. Clean and comfortable Pricey"
3438,Sandra,2023-10-16,"Comfortable nights stay prior to my journey. Accessible to airport, easy check in, and friendly staff. Quiet too considering near the airport. Very clean. Nothing"
3439,Caldwell,2023-10-15,"It was really comfortable and easy - an excellent airport hotel. Bed exceptionally comfortable, room spacious and breakfast excellent. Slightly limited bar snacks and eating option late at night (when I arrived)."
3440,Michael,2023-10-15,All OK It was very convenient for the airport The trek from the coach park to the hotel.
3441,Lin,2023-10-15,Very comfortable quiet rooms with great facilities Clem modern rooms very well equipped with a great shower and lovely fluffy towels Great gym The price of two glasses of wine at the bar!! The path from the hotel to the terminal building was close for building work and the diversion was a very long way around
3442,Andrew,2023-10-15,Superb Unexpectedly good pre 6am breakfast
3443,Andrew,2023-10-13,Fine for the short time we stayed. Air conditioning in the eating area was too cold and uncomfortab Too early a flight for proper breakfast. Takeaway bag for breakfast supplied by hotel pretty unexciting. Breakfast bag
3444,Julie,2023-10-12,Okay At the airport All the work going on outside the building had to take my case a long way around
3445,Geoff,2023-10-12,"Convenient, did what it said on the can booked last minute, overnight stay, no issues Nothing"
3446,Ian,2023-10-12,"Will use again Clean, colour schemes were fine, staff were great, from check in to bar and supper and a super bright ‘good morning’ at 0350hrs. Breakfast and supper, although not stunning in choice, filled us with no complaints To be honest, given this is a Premier Inn level airport hotel, it was clean with a nice bed, sufficient room and the social areas were fine. There was nothing to dislike"
3447,Richard,2023-10-11,"Convenient for Early morning flight We have stayed here many times and as usual everything was great - however Bristol airport has changed over the last 5 years so its not such an attractive location to stay for travellers with 2 large bags and using Rental car as Avis etc ( who used to be just a short walk from the Hotel ) have moved(been moved ) to Silverstone Parking so you have to check in at the hotel, drop your bags, get an hour of free parking then drive out of the hotel car park , drop the car at Silver Stone parking then get the bus to the terminal - since there were no trolleys provided, I grabbed one at the Terminal and took it all the way to our room No trolleys at the hotel - long walk to terminal in the morning due to extensive Bristol Airport extensions to Car Parks etc - thats not the Hotel's fault but it makes it less attractive. That said for early morning flight still the best place to stay near the airport."
3448,Jacqui,2023-10-11,"Convenient, welcoming Clean & modern The restaurant was nice but the queuing system to order wasn’t great."
3449,Patricia,2023-10-10,Satisfactory Everything! Evening meal
3450,Michael,2023-10-09,Very good As an airport hotel it had everything you need. very clean. comfortable and efficient. Continental breakfast from 4.00am was perfect for an early flight. Parking by the hotel is very convenient and the hotel is close to the airport departures. nothing
3451,Lesley,2023-10-09,"Probably stay elsewhere and catch a shuttle bus next time we go away. Close to Airport, friendly helpful staff The detour walk to the airport whilst the building works in place. Fortunately it wasn’t raining. Would have been drenched if it had been. The food choice for evening meals was very limited."
3452,Asta,2023-10-09,"Good Nice room,lovely staff and very clean. Difficult to get with wheelchair from bus station. Long corridor till the room with wheelchair and luggage...not much space in room for disabled person and night light is impossible to turn on with arthritis in fingers. Comfortable beds,but child's bed edges very sharp."
3453,Wendy,2023-10-09,Convenient for early morning flight Convenient Bathroom sliding door was very stiff and heavy to open
3454,Kirstine,2023-10-09,"The hotel suited these weary travellers perfectly. In Bristol Airport. The perfect location for the weary traveller. Good reception at 3am. Nice, comfortable,clean room. with excellent sound proofing. Perfect after a long, tiring journey and flight. Wandering around the self service breakfast which closed ruthlessly at 10am."
3455,Deborah,2023-10-09,"Superb Staff very helpful and accommodating, bar at nightmare good, breakfast very tasty 😋"
3456,Michael,2023-10-09,"Clean and modern and quick access to the airport but the price is outrageous. It was easy to locate and a short walk to departures. The room was modern and had everything we needed and was clean and comfortable. Breakfast is included in the price but was of no use to us as we had an early flight. However the cost per night of this hotel stings! £180 to stay for 1 night is a little outrageous to be honest. Airport hotel or not! We could have parked for 2 weeks for less, which will be our preferred option if the price is still high when we are travelling from Bristol again."
3457,Tim,2023-10-09,Superb Near airport Great check in staff Nothing
3458,Mcmahon,2023-10-09,Superb Close to airport a great base to stop over
3459,Mcmahon,2023-10-09,Superb Close to airport and very Accommodating
3460,Mcmahon,2023-10-09,Superb Close to airport and they are very accommodating Food can be hot and miss
3461,Margaret,2023-10-08,Close to airport perfect Great location to airport
3462,Melissa,2023-10-08,Very good Very good Nil
3463,Paula,2023-10-08,The location is fab. Will definitely be back. Room was lovely and quiet. Spotlessly clean. Location couldn’t have been better. The pillows were very uncomfortable which spoilt the quality of sleep. Breakfast was disappointing. It’s very expensive.
3464,David,2023-10-07,Clean and comfortable but don’t waste money eating their food. Clean and comfortable. The food was TERRIBLE. Clearly designed to be as profitable as possible for The Hilton Group and a miserable experience for the customer. The Singapore Noodles that I had were tasteless and such a mean portion that I was still hungry after finishing them.
3465,Elizabeth,2023-10-07,Very good Breakfast was great
3466,Alison,2023-10-07,"Convenient short stay How near it is to airport terminal, Comfy beds and breakfast Checking in, the receptionist asked for payment again, but i had already paid months in advance."
3467,Maureen,2023-10-07,Very good All very good breakfast and staff very helpful
3468,Annette21,2023-10-06,"staff friendly, welcoming, provided a carrier bag breakfast due to pre 4.00am departure is brilliant The hotel is right by the airport, but there were quite a lot of steps and I would not have managed them alone with a heavy suitcase. The room was excellent - clean and comfortable. We were at the back and able to go to bed at 9pm without being woken by noise of guests or flights. Breakfast to go was very much appreciated at 3.40 am! The food in the restaurant was not as good as I had expected: the choice was limited for me, and the burger and chips I ordered as a last resort was not overwhelming, just ok. My husband chose a curry and was very happy with that. It just shows how our tastes affect our reviews. So other guests would probably love the food choices!! I didn't like the two flights of steps between the hotel and the airport departures."
3469,Martin,2023-10-06,Very good Close to the airport. Clean. Friendly staff Quite expensive for a basic hotel.
3470,Penelope,2023-10-06,"An ideal location and a comfortable stay. The fact that the hotel is just across from the airport. I liked the comfort of the rooms and proximity to airport and coach station. I do not think the standard of breakfast matches the standard of the hotel generally. For instance, last time I stayed there was a choice of fruit and yogurt which seemed to have disappeared this time. I found the level of lighting in my room very low when I arrived in the middle of the night, and needed to quickly find things in my suitcase."
3471,Chris,2023-10-06,"Very good  The food was ok, not good."
3472,Jo,2023-10-06,"Modern, well thought out hotel built for comfort and convenience to the airport. Modern clean and fresh. Convenient to airport and yet well insulated and really quiet. Staff very friendly, efficient. Food very good. Everything was great."
3473,Bowden,2023-10-05,Superb Perfect hotel Nothing I did not like
3474,Claire,2023-10-05,"Site works at the moment The hotel is handy for a pre early flight stay. My husband has difficulty walking, but when we said we had assisted travel, a member of staff arranged for us to be picked up by the airport assistance staff. This was excellent, but I think the hotel needs to tell more of their staff about this facility, another member of staff suggested we could have got a taxi at about £15. There are site works going on between the airport and the hotel, so it was hard to get to the hotel."
3475,Linda,2023-10-05,hotel great once you got inside. outside not good. always a quiet and comfortable stay access was shocking on this occasion. building works all around the access making it dangerous and difficult. Couldn’t find a ramp access to the airport so had to carry luggage up lots of steep steps.
3476,Elizabeth,2023-10-04,Great location for airport stay Location close to terminal The very high costs of car parking at least the first night of staying should be complimentary
3477,Anne,2023-10-04,"Always good as the airport is over the road, but only flying so early will stop us thinking about alternative accommodat The proximity to the airport, the cleanliness, staff and included breakfast. The bed and pillows weren’t comfortable. We felt the mattress needed replacing."
3478,Anthony,2023-10-04,Nice hotel but expensive. Room and food available.
3479,Iftekhar,2023-10-04,Great location with lovely staff The location to Bristol airport is perfect Nothing to say
3480,Deborah,2023-10-03,"Very good good choice of breakfast , staff are friendly and helpful , great hotel to stay at before a flight from Bristol airport"
3481,Andrew,2023-10-03,"Extremely convenient, high quality, high price. Perfect position for the airport, comfortable, clean, exceptionally attentive staff and a really good breakfast starting early enough for the first flights. The parking arrangements are at first sight a little daunting; however the staff can help once you have the courage to pass through the barrier! The hotel is priced to exploit a captive market - don’t expect a discount. You pay for what you get convenience."
3482,Peter,2023-10-03,Good clean and convenient stay Convenient location for airport Slot of work going on around the airport surroundings
3483,Peter,2023-10-02,A really good end to our holiday on kos Top quality and value of the evening special on the menu and as always a good hotel breakfast The pathway to the airport was badly effected by construction
3484,Rebecca,2023-10-02,"Great, convenient and friendly staff Location is great for flights out of Bristol Airport and long stay parking adjacent. Staff really friendly and good bar/restaurant for evening meal. It’s quite expensive for one night stays. We left too early before breakfast was served but it would have been good if we could have been offered a continental breakfast/take away. Also couldn’t get anyone to help with the £5 drop off charge as it was so busy at reception so ended up paying it."
3485,Richard,2023-10-02,Overpriced for what it is. All about closeness to airport Close to airport terminal and spacious room The cost for what is little more than a travel lodge.
3486,Ian,2023-10-02,Very good Easy next to airport Nothing
3487,Wayne,2023-10-02,Great location but you pay for it. Very good hotel in general All as expected Cost is an issue that needs to be considered with this hotel
3488,Jennifer,2023-10-01,Good  Price
3489,Richard,2023-10-01,Convenient but overpriced Easy walking distance to the airport Rather soulless airport. Breakfast in the bag was very limited
3490,Graeme,2023-10-01,Superb Quiet room
3491,John,2023-10-01,"Fine- very much what I needed, very comfortable and convenient. Good room, perfect location for my purposes, food very good, both on arrival ( the pizza is great) and at Breakfast the next morning. Excellent service, very friendly and helpful staff. The parking was a bit more expensive than advertised, and very confusing. Also, foot access to the airport is rather convoluted due to construction work."
3492,Susan,2023-10-01,"Ideal place to stay if on an early morning flight Room was very good and the breakfast first class Explaining how to get to the Hotel carpark, when we phoned the hotel and asked for the instructions on how to find the car park, the instructions were vague and unclear. It cost us £7.50 as we parked in the wrong car park, when we arrived at the hotel and explained this to one of the staff they were very unhelpful about are suituation, saying it was very easy to find your carpark."
3493,Roger,2023-09-30,Superb Comfortable hotel and friendly staff. Bristol Airport. Renovations which will last for 18 months. Make access to the hotel difficult. A long walk in the pouring rain.
3494,Lesley-ann,2023-09-29,Convenient for airport Near airport Building works
3495,David,2023-09-29,Had to queue twice at reception. All very handy for airport. Were told we couldn't buy a drink at the bar until we had registered at reception to be able to do so. Had already stood in a queue to check in then had to go back and do it again. Never known anything like it - just to get a glass of wine!
3496,Alison,2023-09-29,"Ok for the convenience Mostly good. Rooms as nice as usual. Requested an extra sheet which was in the bedroom on arrival - very happy :) Staff are always nice Handy M&S in the airport terminal prior to departures (not overpriced) so we picked up a few nibbles. Early breakfast (03:00) take out was rubbish. Dry croissant, horrid apple juice and an apple or banana - that was it. Expected a much better selection for 'continental' -perhaps a portion of cheese and crackers if you don't like sweet for breakfast which I do not. Have had a much nicer breakfast at the hotel when our flight was later in the morning. Room was very nice, as expected, although it is overpriced for a room but I suppose you pay for the convenience being at the airport!"
3497,Dwayne,2023-09-29,Polite staff excellent service Convenience ￼to airport Overpriced
3498,Kathryn,2023-09-29,Very good Lovely reception staff. Everything clean and well maintained. Incredibly convenient location to the airport Price of food/drink at hotel. Having stayed here in July and paid £40 for two tiny servings of pasta and 2 glasses of red wine. Decided to get food from M and S at the airport. Much cheaper.
3499,Deborah,2023-09-28,Good Location Was expensive with no other alternative available
3500,Sasha,2023-09-27,Very good Great location. Nice hotel. Bathroom and rooms are lovely. The beds are so uncomfortable. Food was not great. The burger was poor.
3501,Michael,2023-09-26,"Clean, modern hotel ideally located for early morning flight. Breakfast & evening meal adequate but pricey. Room good, clean & everything worked. Super bed. Alarm call right on time. Helpful staff. Access to airport terminal through building site - not something that could be helped at present. Shower tray slippery."
3502,Barbara,2023-09-26,Good location and friendly staff. Location Not the easiest check-in process.
3503,Julia,2023-09-26,"It was OK for an early morning departure The staff were helpful, and the room was clean but basic. The food in the restaurant downstairs was awful. Because we were staying there specifically to fly out the next morning, we didn't want to head into town, so it was the only option. Also, there is no shuttle to the airport. It should be a short walk but the usual path was all dug up so we had to drag heavy cases a long way."
3504,Martine,2023-09-26,good enough for one night stay and perfect for flying.  no usb points. no little extras like toothpaste would have been useful. restaurant is horrible. no flexibility . rather cold in the room.
3505,Anne,2023-09-25,Great Very helpful staff Nothing
3506,Grantmavrata,2023-09-25,"Good, but not very good. Location to the airport was very convenient, even on very late arrival just gone midnight, signage was easy to follow through groundwork being done. Was expensive compared to other chains we often use. No USB sockets in the room, often quite common these days. Nobody greeting guests at breakfast. Details but expected a little more for over £200 for a night. It was a convenient option for a kate flight."
3507,John,2023-09-25,"Quite good overall Breakfast was ok I suspect scrambled eggs were powdered, bacon was hardly cooked."
3508,Hamish,2023-09-23,Very good Super efficient and friendly staff. Clean and spacious hotel. Perfect for an early morning flight.
3509,Julie,2023-09-23,"Excellent location It’s location on Bristol Airports site is so convenient Nice size room, slept extremely well Very clean and comfortable, staff lovely The evening meal quality was very poor, Shame it let the hotel down"
3510,Judy,2023-09-22,Overall very good Convenient generally very happy
3511,Gary,2023-09-21,We’ll stay there again if the need comes up Great location Midnight fire alarm wasn’t on our agenda. Not property fault.
3512,Norma,2023-09-21,Very good Close to airport
3513,Grahame,2023-09-20,Very good Enjoyed my stay apart from being woken by fire alarm at 12pm Fire alarm going off after being asleep for 2 hours. Didn't seem very organised.. Room no wasn't taken How did they know every body was out of building?
3514,Elizabeth,2023-09-19,"Lovely staff Friendly, helpful staff. Some snacks in the room would be appreciated."
3515,Michael,2023-09-19,Very good Location is key Price
3516,Graham,2023-09-19,Good Convenience to airport Better restaurant experience - menu was a bit basic
3517,Peter,2023-09-19,"Convenient The location was perfect and the very early morning breakfast was very convenient for early morning flights. It was disappointing that the free Wi-Fi did NOT have an internet connection, also that one of the bedside cabinets was broken. Not what I expected from a Hampton by Hilton hotel !"
3518,David,2023-09-18,"Very enjoyable, lovely breakfast Very clean & modern Didn’t expect to walk quite so far from the airport at 1oclock in the morning, but of cause road works need to be done."
3519,Frederic,2023-09-18,Superb  A/c too cold at the restaurant
3520,Bethan,2023-09-18,Great start to the holiday. Great location and early breakfast.
3521,Hugh,2023-09-17,"Great, smart, clean, handy hotel with friendly and professional staff! Good all round! The location is excellent for the airport, it could hardly be easier. The transport options to the airport all worked well without the pressure of an early start in the day if travel. Nothing springs to mind!"
3522,Robert,2023-09-17,Good place to stay before a morning flight from Bristol Large airy bar and restaurant area. Nothing to add
3523,Richard,2023-09-17,"Ideal location and easy to reach from the airport, was somewhat expensive due presumably to this Location ease of booking in and cleanliness of the hotel The shower room had a major issue with the run off to the drain and flooded the bathroom and entrance way to the bedroom area I informed the staff but the problem is obviously due to poor design"
3524,Ed,2023-09-17,Perfect place to stay after a late arrival Very close to arrivals. Bar open late. I think signage via the route to buses is a waste of time for arriving passengers. Survey better to direct left outside arrivals.
3525,Christine,2023-09-17,"Good Have used the hotel since built. Perfect for the airport. The price has virtually doubled. £180 for just one night, booked well in advance is a lot."
3526,Julian,2023-09-17,"Great staff, lovely room. Good bed. Good choice for breakfast. Location. Close to the airport The walk from the airport is a bit of a bomb site"
3527,Ruth,2023-09-17,"Lovely stay Clean & comfortable. Room was spacious. Good breakfast options. A short walk to the airport, very convenient. Buses to/from Bristol & Bath regularly a short walk from the hotel."
3528,Fiona,2023-09-16,Great location if you want to take the stress out of an early flight Location on the airport site as we had an early flight. Staff were friendly and helpful.
3529,Vinny,2023-09-16,"Good Lovely big room, comfortable bed No drinking water in the room Breakfast was very poor, cold plates,bacon and sausage looked boiled ,didn't even bother."
3530,Roland,2023-09-15,OK Reception very helpful for our late at night arrival Windows completely sealed. we wanted some fresh air
3531,Grant,2023-09-14,"Comfortable stay in good location with everything I needed. Having a decent gym with working equipment in good condition was really good. Meal options were fine. Bar comfortable. Male staff member on reception was a bit short with me when I asked about a receipt. He explained I would get it after I checked out as if I should know, I paid a lot of money the day before and needed to claim it back from my employer so it was important to me. I just needed a pleasant explanation."
3532,Thibault,2023-09-13,"The only way to stay near the airport + Location + Quality - Price, is way overpriced"
3533,Becky,2023-09-12,"Good The staff were friendly and helpful. I could share a room with my two daughters, making it more affordable. The room was ideal - clean, well designed and just what we needed. Food was pretty good and amazingly, breakfast was available from 4am so early flights don't have to mean missing breakfast! So super convenient for Bristol Airport - great to be able to walk from the carpark to the hotel and from the hotel to the airport. No complaints - exactly what we needed."
3534,Yoland,2023-09-12,Very good Perfect for what we needed before an early flight. Breakfast service starts early enough for those needing to leave early. Simple but tasty dinner choices.
3535,Helen,2023-09-11,We would stay again but hope for more pillows. Friendly helpful staff. Good size room Lack of pillows!!
3536,Andrew,2023-09-11,"Lovely rooms, great staff, need deep pockets Location was great, apart from the surrounding civil works to improve access, which was difficult to navigate amongst bus queues and barriers. Room was lovely, shame we only spent 4.5 hours in it due to our late arrival, Room not ready due to demand, and a very early departure. Clean and pleasant bar area, staff lovely. Overall pleased with the hotel. Breakfast was basic at the early time we needed to leave for our departure, and there was too little food on display, with no staff around to replenish the food items, mostly run out of choice. For the overnight stay cost, including breakfast, we were very disappointed, and hungry during our day of travel. This was a letdown for us, especially paying £230 for a single night, we expected a better Breakfast experience, and not need to spend more money on food during our travels. Also, drinks in the bar were very expensive, seems a captive audience are charged way over the normal going rate."
3537,Neil,2023-09-11,Superb Location. Cost.
3538,Diane,2023-09-11,Quite a lot of money for a large modern clean soulless room at convenient place for flight The breakfast was it's redeemable feature. I had croissants and fruit and yogurt and coffee. The breakfast was really good quality . Very pleased with the breakfast. It felt more homely and family orientated for the breakfast. A bit more heart and soul. Liked the decor and the happy slogans. It was a bit of a shock that you queued up to place an order for food. As my friend said an expensive MacDonalds. Coincidentally I ended up ordering the burger bun and chips. I felt starving hungry and needed something to fill me up. The burger was really good. So it worked 😁. Next time I would know what to expect. Might try another food option. Like the noodles for example. Just was expecting a sit down restaurant with table service like other airport hotels. I thought maybe they had trouble getting staff. The receptionist said there was no proper kitchen on site. Did not really like the atmosphere of the evening dining. Lovely chairs dining area but felt soulless in the evening. The company could have a better chance here to win hearts and minds.
3539,Christine,2023-09-11,Comfortable beds so well rested before a long day of travelling We had an early flight but the Continental breakfast had a good choice of items Separating drinks only from the food ordering queue might have been more efficient
3540,Anne,2023-09-10,Convenient overnight stay for departure flight. Within easy walking distance of airport. Comfortable bed in quiet room with air conditioning. Good breakfast. Evening meal was disappointing. The choice was limited so felt the meals on offer should have been of a higher standard. Curry has small amounts of chicken and no flavour.
3541,Linda,2023-09-10,Very good Beds Quality of jacket potatoes in restaurant
3542,Mike,2023-09-10,"Convenient The location couldn't be better. Enjoyed the curry Building work outside had bad signing, we walked a few hundred yards to go just a few, it was confirmed at reception that a lot of customers had suffered the same, it would have been good if someone had sorted it out so that we could have got there a lot more directly."
3543,Paul,2023-09-10,Superb Location is superb. Breakfast was excellent Could be a better walk way to get to the hotel from the airport
3544,Don,2023-09-09,"Overall our stay was great - but brief as we checked in late afternoon & checked out early next day Nice, clean room, very quiet which was appreciated as we had an early flight on checkout day. Staff were all helpful, courteous, and very good at what they do. Delicious food in the restaurant. And cold beer! Nothing really. Maybe the fact our Uber driver had to pay a fee - which was passed on to us - to drop us at the front entrance of the hotel."
3545,Kenneth,2023-09-08,"Good Quick check in,room had everything you need Bathroom was good,with good shower and toiletries. Great breakfast , good coffee and ample choice. It's the airport,so we know we are going to pay extra for most things,but felt this was taken to extreme. I stayed in a hotel at Heathrow,10 days previously,same company ,but half the price. Also felt bar prices were expensive,pint and gin and tonic 21pounds."
3546,Stacey,2023-09-08,Very good Nice welcome after a delayed flight
3547,Heulwenn,2023-09-08,Very good Easy check in and check out. Some staff were non talkative. Some would also ask you stuff to make conversation and were then very uninterested or wouldn't listen. Took a while to clean up any tables in the evening
3548,Glyn,2023-09-07,Latest stay Location facilities comfort Nothing
3549,Sarah,2023-09-06,"Small room but clean and good breakfast. Great location. Tasty breakfast with a lot of variety. Clean room and nice toiletries in bathroom. Nice and quiet - couldn’t hear outside noise at all, or other guests. Tiny room and small bed. For travellers arriving with a lot of luggage, as you would expect near an airport, there is next to no space for luggage. We had our daughter with us so the couch was made into a bed so no space in that part of the room for us to put anything. Pillows were very uncomfortable."
3550,Helen,2023-09-06,Very good Location is excellent Rooms are small for a family
3551,Kimberley,2023-09-06,"Good Breakfast was very good, so much variety. Great location for early morning flights with only walking distance to airport"
3552,Francis,2023-09-06,"Good Friendly staff, excellent facilities just a shame I didn't have more time to use them. Very close to the airport so easy for early morning flight. Not being able to sleep for as long."
3553,Christopher,2023-09-06,Great overnight stop for Bristol Airport Perfect location for Bristol Airport Nothing
3554,Sophie,2023-09-05,"Good value for money The room was very beautiful & rustic Italian, it was good value for money & the lady running it sent me a video on how to unlock the door, where the iron was etc & met me in a local restaurant to give me the key While it says private bathroom, this is separate from the room & there is a room in between. Which is fine but may be off putting for others as not clearly described"
3555,Pauline,2023-09-05,We had a very pleasant stay and the hotel is very convenient for the airport the room was large and very comfortable The bed was very comfortable The bathroom with a shower was very clean and spacious. The bar area and area where you order food are combined so when its busy there is a queue.
3556,Debbie,2023-09-05,Short walk from hotel Close to airport expensive for our few hours stay
3557,Raymond,2023-09-04,Very good So conveniently located by the airport and rooms are very comfortable and quiet
3558,Andrew,2023-09-04,Practical but canteen restaurant Close to airport Restaurant was basic for quality hotel
3559,Sara,2023-09-03,Convenient Conveniently located across from the terminal. Breakfast served from 4am. Kind staff. A bit pricy for what it is. Could use a renovation.
3560,Jane,2023-09-03,Very good Convenient for the airport
3561,Susan,2023-09-03,So convenient for airport I would come again. Distance to terminal. Pricey gin and tonic.
3562,William,2023-09-02,Very pleasant stay Everything was satisfactory -no complaints -would stay again if flying from Bristol
3563,Peter,2023-09-02,Location Location Location Location Location Location Evening dinner portions at the restaurant were small
3564,Richard,2023-09-01,Expensive Clean and modern Food from restaurant small portions and very expensive
3565,Marina,2023-09-01,Very good  The car park charged me £192 for an overnight stay on my credit card and my debit card. Not happy.
3566,Simon,2023-08-31,Very good Very convenient to the airport and the rooms were very well insulated against noise ( such as aircraft movements) snd lights. Our stay was too short
3567,Tracey,2023-08-31,"Convenient, clean Location Clean Staff excellence N/a"
3568,Jane,2023-08-31,Great place to stay for an early flight Location. Comfy bed. Good shower N/a
3569,Jay,2023-08-31,Very nice  The pillows. You need to change them uncomfortable
3570,Walker,2023-08-30,Very good Good Everything was as expected
3571,Hazel,2023-08-30,Excellent for stay. Didn’t have time for much breakfast! What we had was good. Don’t know.
3572,Carey,2023-08-30,Very handy for Bristol Airport The closeness to the airport. We could walk from the hotel to the terminal within 5 or so minutes. It was quite a basic hotel and seemed very expensive for the facilities available.
3573,Beth,2023-08-30,"Super convenient for Bristol Airport, bit pricey but can walk to the terminal The shower design was really nice, very modern with quality soap and lotion provided. Lovely touch that they give you a breakfast bag to go if you leave early for a flight before the cooked breakfast starts. The mattress was good, not the most comfy I've ever had at a hotel, but good for the night. The pillows were very nice."
3574,Sonia,2023-08-30,"Nice relaxing way to start a holiday Convenient location to Bristol Airport, great way to start a holiday Limited evening meal menu"
3575,Maire,2023-08-28,An ideal spot for that early morning flight. This hotel is so close to the airport which was ideal for us with an early morning flight. A good choice of food available for the evening and a lovely choice for breakfast the following morning at 4am. The staff were so welcoming and helpful. Nothing.
3576,Julie,2023-08-28,"Great location, care with parking charges! Room was fine and great location for early flight Car parking charges not as advertised and managers attitude when challenged left allot to be desired. Get you don't own car park but don't advertise one rate on website and another at entrance to car park"
3577,Kirsteen,2023-08-28,Very good Large comfortable beds No charge points for phone in room
3578,Sally,2023-08-27,Very good Friendly and welcoming and excellent location
3579,Jerry,2023-08-27,Very good All Nothing
3580,Seamus,2023-08-27,Ideal location to airport for early flight Great location from the hotel - literally across the road. Nice early breakfast offering. Quite expensive for basic room but I did book it quite late. Food area was too busy for dinner.
3581,Emma,2023-08-26,"Great for early flights The staff were helpful, the room was great - spacious, well presented and modern, and the restaurant served a good choice of food. Service was good too. I wasn't impressed that I had to pay an additional fee for parking at the hotel. This should be included as part of the room price, as you would expect patrons of the property to be the only ones using the parking available."
3582,Christopher,2023-08-26,"As expected. Nice place to stay. All good, as expected. Clean and spotless. Lovely buffet breakfast. Ideally situated a short walk from the airport."
3583,Martha,2023-08-26,very comfortable beds and helpful staff. the hotel is in a super handy location a very short walk from the airport so is ideal. the prices are rather high I guess it is a captive market.
3584,Doreen,2023-08-26,A comfortable clean room and great location to the airport Location to airport. Able to walk there A little expensive for a single traveler
3585,Lynda,2023-08-26,"Excellent definitely recommend the hotel Early breakfast, 5 o’clock was more than adequate Nice quiet room Nothing to dislike at all"
3586,Julia,2023-08-24,"We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay and wished we'd got up earlier for a full breakfast. Exceptionally clean, very quiet and the early breakfast was fantastic. The frosted glass on the bathroom door although opaque, still allowed the silhouette image of the person in the bathroom and what they were doing could be seen by occupants in the bedroom."
3587,Krustine,2023-08-23,A comfortable place to rest weary heads 😊 Our easy jet flight was cancelled and delayed 12 hrs - last minute booking - met all our needs - we booked in at 2345hrs and left at 0445 - comfortable place to rest weary heads
3588,Pierce,2023-08-22,Adequate Location The system for serving drinks at the bar
3589,Julie,2023-08-21,Convenient overnight stop for early or late flights Our plane was delayed so we were late getting back to Bristol airport and rather than drive 2 hours in the middle of the night we found this hotel a convenient place to stay. Very comfortable bed and nice buffet breakfast. Staff very helpful too. Parking a little expensive but that’s airport hotels for you...
3590,Robert,2023-08-21,"Superb Great location, close to airport"
3591,Mary,2023-08-21,"Convenient but expensive airport hotel Location is great - a few minutes walk from airport terminal. Room is fine & breakfast ok. The company continues to use feather bedding, which I'm highly allergic to. I noted this when I made the booking & sent a subsequent message on booking.com but received no acknowledgement or response. However reception had a note & checked the bedding was hypoallergenic. So it was resolved BUT it would be much better if the company just stopped using this. I've stayed in many hotels in recent years across Europe, Asia & South America and it seems to be ONLY Hampton & Radisson hotels at UK airports that continue to use feathers & to refuse to put safety of guests first. PLEASE CAN THIS BE REVIEWED. I shouldn't have to make this request when I book at a hotel, especially at the prices charged. I am sure you take other allergies eg. peanuts seriously so it would be much appreciated - & easier for you -if you avoided risks by using the types of bedding now in use at the vast majority of hotels."
3592,Sara,2023-08-21,Clean comfortable and quiet! Location
3593,John,2023-08-20,good for early flight ok so you can get breakfast early but only continental free parking would of been nice
3594,Kylie,2023-08-20,"Great location, very convenient. Extremely comfortable stay before our early morning flight! The location was excellent - very easy for an early flight. We liked everything"
3595,Sian,2023-08-20,Very good Convenient Quite expensive
3596,Simon,2023-08-20,Good 2 min walk to departure. Overpriced
3597,Carol,2023-08-20,Great for an overnight stay Location. Walking distance to airport Limited menu in restaurant/bar
3598,Jayne,2023-08-20,Very convenient stay for airport - peaceful hotel in great location Location for airport Very clean Very quiet Menu choice could be better
3599,Gemma,2023-08-18,Comfortable and practical Perfect location for an early flight I paid double what my travel partner paid
3600,Lawrence,2023-08-18,Very good  Food menu poor and expensive
3601,Julija,2023-08-17,"Very good Location, facilities Price is too expensive"
3602,John,2023-08-17,"Great location, good value for money, helpful and friendly staff Location was excellent, arrival process was seamless, would certainly look at booking again. Nothing"
3603,Jon,2023-08-17,Convenient. Comfortable. Spacious. Clean. Great location for terminal for early morning flight Nothing
3604,Mark,2023-08-16,Easy start to our holiday! Great location. Staff were helpful. The food was expensive and poor quality.
3605,Martyn,2023-08-15,Did the job Functional Impersonal
3606,Lee,2023-08-15,"Very good Location superb,no stress for airport transfer"
3607,Nicola,2023-08-15,Perfect for overnight stay before early morning flight Very helpful reception staff
3608,Mark,2023-08-15,Very handy when you have an early flight The Hotel is on site at the airport so I often use it when I am flying early. Rooms are very nice and modern and exrtemely quiet. Stayed here more that once. Used the restaurant in the evening and breakfast in the morning which starts at 4am. Price is a lot higher than similar hotels (close to £200 a night) but they know you have little other option I suppose. Doesnt stop me using the hotel but the principle bothers me a bit!
3609,Graham,2023-08-15,Ideal location if rather expensive Clean and modern. Ideal location for early flight. Sink and shower drains not flowing well. Reported on departure and sure they will be fixed. Hotel has something of a monopoly for “on airport” location which probably explains rather high cost for very short stay.
3610,Bruce,2023-08-14,"Convenient It was basically an airport transfer hotel and the facilities suitable to cover passenger needs The convenience to the airport although, due to airports ground works we had to walk further than expected"
3611,Mark,2023-08-14,Convenient for airport very friendly and competent staff great breakfast Good breakfast staff very friendly and helpful Could always be cheaper Put times of breakfast and dinner on website
3612,Sally,2023-08-13,"Although we only stayed for 6 hours due to a delayed flight, everything was great! The lady on the desk at 3 in the morning (our plane was severely delayed) was lovely and smiley. The same can be said for the next shift. Breakfast was welcome and good as well as being included within the price. Nothing as far as I can see. The hotel served its purpose for us."
3613,Jonathan,2023-08-12,Flying from Bristol Lots of choice at Breakfast and good quality. Proximity to the airport. Service. Size of the room for a family of three.
3614,Michelle,2023-08-12,Did the job All fine for an airport hotel. Quite pricey.
3615,Susan,2023-08-12,The convenience of the hotel is the reason we choose to stay. I did not have breakfast but it looked very nice. The location is perfect for the Airport I think that the price of a glass of wine is outrageously expensive. I live in Spain and I could buy 6 bottles of wine for the price of one glass at the hotel. Apart from that our stay was very pleasant and was suitable for our onward flight.
3616,John,2023-08-12,I had great relaxing stay and a good night's rest before my early morning jounrey I enjoyed the evening meal Singapore Noodles was delicious. In the morning I had an early flight 7.20 am and found the buffet breakfast was great. It had a wide selection of items and catered to a variety of appetites. Queueing and placing an order at the bar could be improved especially these days if there is an app that can help in both placing and paying for an order. Much like Weatherspoons own app. That said the staff were very helpful and the human interaction was appreciated.
3617,Anne,2023-08-11,Perfect for an airport stop over Location to airport! Nothing
3618,Hannah,2023-08-11,"good booking in , airport , staff very helpful and always straightforward to check in and out always find it over priced for what it is"
3619,Julian,2023-08-10,Fantastic welcome at the front desk and clean and comfy room next to the airport. The location to the airport is perfect. The room was clean and modern. The weclome by Alex on the front desk was as welcoming as you could get and really informative. Lovely guy. A little bit pricey but you pay for the location and quality of hotel. It was worth it.
3620,Kathryn,2023-08-10,Very comfortable but would not normally pay this rate for a hotel. Purely because of location. Staff on reception very pleasant and helpful Very expensive
3621,Susan,2023-08-10,Stayed to be close to airport & went well Nice choice & good that it's included.
3622,Ruth,2023-08-10,"Always a pleasant stay, just need to adresss the bar area. The location. Right across the road from airport. Stayed here many times and still the queue at the bar to order drinks and food is ridiculous, up to 30 minute wait they need to come up with a new system."
3623,Cathleen,2023-08-10,Great for an overnight transit 250m walk to the airport which is great for an early flight and the room was very comfortable Nothing
3624,Katie,2023-08-09,"Convenient for airport stop over Easy access from airport, quiet Our room was far too small for 3 people - no space for luggage and very little space round bed to walk"
3625,Bridie,2023-08-09,"Comfortable, modern, relaxing Close proximity to the airport. Nice and modern, friendly staff. That you can’t use cash. Cash is legal tender."
3626,Samantha,2023-08-08,You feel like you're on holiday as soon as you step inside! Comfortable rooms and delicious breakfast. Super convenient for the airport. It's a little pricey and a bath would be good.
3627,Ann,2023-08-08,Excellent for overnight airport hotel Well placed for airport and bus station and very comfortable beds No usb charging points
3628,Chris,2023-08-08,Very good How clean the room was and how big it was for the money. Good sized sofa in room An airport hotel people use to catch early flights but they don't serve hot breakfast until 0600
3629,Lucy,2023-08-08,Very good Spacious and clean Staff very friendly and helpful Windows faced other rooms. This meant curtains had to be drawn almost always
3630,Mary,2023-08-07,Overall as expected and ideal location Location ideal for an early flight. The staff were very helpful especially at checkout when I experienced difficulty in finding a trolley as I had a lot of luggage. The receptionist went above and beyond to help me. It was quite pricey for the type of accommodation
3631,Jeremy,2023-08-07,Very good Clean and comfortable and close to check in for early morning flight.
3632,Neil,2023-08-06,"Convenient, very good quality hotel within 100m of the arrivals gate Great location. VERY quiet in spite of being on the airport. Good cooked breakfast buffet. Friendly late night reception staff. Nothing."
3633,Elaine,2023-08-06,"Perfect for a late flight home Convenient to the airport The sofa bed was very difficult to get in and out of, due to the metal frame protruding from the bed. Very easy to catch your leg"
3634,Thomas,2023-08-06,Convenient Convenient Nothing
3635,Arthur,2023-08-06,Good all round hotel shame about additional parking charge Breakfast was great room was excellent although a little pricey very close to airport which we could walk to Extra cost of £14.00 to park the car overnight
3636,Lynn,2023-08-05,Chose the hotel because of location for early flight. Met all expeditions and standards very good. Close to airport. Staff at Reception exceptional. Alex and Tom.
3637,Theresa,2023-08-05,Enjoyed the comfort of the room and the pillows were wonderful to sleep on . Quick and easy access from the airport. Lovely comfortable beds and lovely bathroom. We were very disappointed that there were no face flannels in our bathroom. We had to wash with the corner of one of the hand towels. We were amazed that there was a carpenter doing work in the sitting area of the restaurant when we went down to breakfast in the morning. Didn’t expect to have to listen to someone banging into the seat frames that he was installing in the seating area of the restaurant. Also we thought that the £14.50 parking charges were extortionate just for 1 nights parking. We didn’t check in to the hotel until the early hours of the morning.
3638,Margaret,2023-08-04,Comfortable and convenientl for airport Staff were helpful & friendly. Room was clean & comfortable. Breakfast was perfect for an early morning start Nothing
3639,Mark,2023-08-04,Recommended. Close proximity to the airport. Within walking distance. Excellent staff all round. The choice of food. But this is a minor gripe.
3640,Moira,2023-08-04,"Very good Very comfortable rooms. Accessible room with the adjoining room was perfect for our needs Breakfast was a little disappointing - it seemed like a good range but toaster didn't toast properly, horrible scrambled eggs, syrup for waffles didn't flow etc etc"
3641,Robert,2023-08-03,Was short stay but staff and presentation was very good Room very clean and look good well presented. Bed was nice and comfortable with lovely bedding. Breakfast was nice and tasty with plenty of choice. There was nothing I disliked
3642,Rebecca,2023-08-03,Very good Very clean and tidy Great location for airport departure and arrival Choice at breakfast was v v good Quietness of rooms Shower was Lovley and nice shower gel and hand soap Just thought the parking could have been included in the price
3643,Charlotte,2023-08-01,Very good Location and staff excellent. Rooms very clean and spacious. Pillows are awful!
3644,Paul,2023-08-01,No nonsense and a step from departure gates Location!! Utilitarian
3645,Laura,2023-08-01,Delivered where easyJet failed! Needed a room for the night after flight was cancelled. Being right at the airport it was convenient. Room was clean comfortable and welcomed after sitting in the airport for hours. Reception staff were patient and helpful with myself and the rest of the weary and disgruntled easyJet customers. Nothing. The hotel was great.
3646,Paul,2023-08-01,"excellent all round modern, clean, good food and drink and excellent staff could have done with spare pillows in rooms"
3647,Gerry,2023-08-01,"Very good Location, breakfast , quiet room"
3648,Anna,2023-07-31,"Location is good, but... It is SO convenient to be able to walk to the terminal if you're dropping someone off for a 4am check-in. The food is not great. Breakfast was especially disappointing - really terrible coffee, no bacon, rock hard (yesterdays?) croissants. At almost £200 a night for B&B, it was a shock to then also pay £14 for overnight parking (reduced from £45!!)."
3649,Gavin,2023-07-30,"The perfect stay over before an early flight! Location, comfort of the room and the quality of the food. The coffee at breakfast. I’d be prepared to pay more for a proper espresso!"
3650,Sarah,2023-07-30,"Good Stayed the night before an early morning departure. Easy to find on arrival to the airport via taxi. We didn't eat at the restaurant for dinner. Check in process was relatively straightforward. Staff at checkin and checkout were very helpful. Breakfast was served from early in the morning which was great and plenty of choice and food for everyone. No queues at the bar or restaurant at breakfast. The room was very quiet and couldn't hear any plane noise or people moving about in the corridors or rooms which was great. Would recommend to anyone with an early flight and that doesn't want the hassle of Bristol traffic in the morning The bar staff were disorganised - couldn't find items on the till, didn't seem to know their drinks menu, randomly selecting sizes of drinks etc. But overall the stay was good."
3651,Johnston,2023-07-30,Staff always friendly and welcoming. Hotel facilities always to high standard Location ideal for stay over for early flight. Access to parking and airport within easy walking distance All good
3652,Matthew,2023-07-30,"Nice hotel but got locked in the bathroom Great location, I like that we could get breakfast very early. The lock on the bathroom door didn't work properly. I got locked in the bathroom and couldn't get out. The door locked but I couldn't unlock it. Luckily my wife was able to open the door from the outside, but I'm not sure I would have got out if I had been travelling alone."
3653,Catherine,2023-07-30,Perfect for airport stay Location excellent for airport Breakfast is very tired. Needs fresh products.
3654,Anna,2023-07-30,Superb Near airport
3655,Kathrin,2023-07-29,efficient and convenient Very convenient for Bristol airport; short walk to Terminal; convenient breakfast from 4am for early flight.
3656,Jennifer,2023-07-29,"Flight landed at 01:15, 5 minute walk to the hotel, lovely comfortable bed! Everything Nothing"
3657,Lorna,2023-07-28,Pleasant nice food Booking in Very bad smell in first room had to move
3658,La,2023-07-28,A good night's sleep The location is the best bit about the hotel. I stay here every time I fly into Bristol airport. It's so convenient. A good night's sleep is certain in the hotel. The staff are friendly. No. It was all good.
3659,Julia,2023-07-28,"Very good The room,the staff, lovely big shower very comfortable. Restaurant lovely the breakfast superb. I didn't like the fact that although reception were aware of needing assistance from airport staff to collect me I had to keep pestering them to give me an answer from assistance and they arrived at least an hour late.also couldn't get TV to work with remote that was there.also an alarm went off at 3 a.m and reception brought in a ladder to sort it .apart from was ok"
3660,Paul,2023-07-27,Superb Short 5m walk from airport .Efficient and friendly check in check out .Nice room and big shower.Late night supper was good and breakfast very good .large car park . Nothing
3661,Frank,2023-07-26,"F&B  Food terrible, had to queue to order dinner. Breakfast croissants stale, coffee machine out of action."
3662,Hector,2023-07-26,Very good  Doors bang shut if not careful and therefore noisy
3663,Bcn,2023-07-26,"Good location for the airport The location was good as we were meeting a friend flying in to the airport. It was an hour drive to the Cotswolds which we planned to explore. I found the hotel very overpriced. It was one of the most expensive hotels on our trip and was nothing extraordinary. There was a big variety of food at the breakfast. The room was ok, nothing special. The staff were fairly friendly but nothing special either."
3664,Penny,2023-07-26,Great hotel with the loveliest staff Great location and great facilities. The gentleman at the reception was exceptionally helpful and considerate of our needs as a big family; it was clear he went above and beyond to ensure our rooms were as close together as possible. My sibling was also offered an emergency dental kit when they forgot to pack their toothbrush. It was a lovely stay all in all. It’s a shame there’s no hot breakfast until 6AM and we had to leave before that. The continental breakfast available was lovely though.
3665,Amy,2023-07-25,"Only stayed for 1 night but it was comfortable Breakfast was nice, good selection. Nice size bed. Cleanliness needs a little attentive to the shower."
3666,Rodney,2023-07-25,Superb Everything Menu
3667,Joanne,2023-07-24,Bit pricey but for location standard of rooms can’t be faulted Close to departures nice friendly staff
3668,Joe,2023-07-24,"Facilities really nice, food terrible and price very expensive for just the night. Room was big, clean and was no noise. Good wasn’t the best, me and girlfriend had food night before there wasn’t many gluten free options for her and my meal was very bad had a burger and might be one of the worst ones I’ve ever had, breakfast in the morning was ok, for the price of one night staying there I would think the food would be much better and night time food wasn’t included so had to pay for that."
3669,Rachid,2023-07-24,Very good Praticable for an early flight Parking
3670,Colm,2023-07-23,"Nothing too exciting but nice staff and food was fairly decent. General airport hotel style., ie bland. I was VERY disappointed that we had to pay extra for parking for 1 night after already paying an extra £20 for my dog that slept on the floor"
3671,Ann,2023-07-22,Superb The room is very nice and the was great
3672,Mansel,2023-07-22,"An uncomfortable, convenient stay location was very convenient The sofa bed was very uncomfortable"
3673,Stark,2023-07-21,Good Proximity to airport. Welcoming staff. Spacious room Room was too hot
3674,Amanda,2023-07-21,Great place to stay for early flight Handy for early morning flight Booking.com described room as Queens room but only had double bed
3675,Marie,2023-07-21,"Superb Convenient location for flying from Bristol, confortable room and good breakfast"
3676,Guy,2023-07-21,"An overpriced airport hotel for an overnight stay! Basic accommodation but lovely staff! It is functional but totally overpriced! As an airport hotel, the staff are extremely helpful. The parking charges for leaving car overnight before departing from Bristol airport are outrageous. Parking charges in hotel car park. Basic accommodation. Cleanliness needs improving."
3677,Johnny,2023-07-20,Did the job well. Near airport Not have a small cooler/fridge
3678,Jenny,2023-07-20,It’s ok but could do better Lovely styled hotel. Great location for airport Food menu really poor. Staff were slow at serving.
3679,Sean,2023-07-19,"Superb Location, staff friendly, quiet Only thing was no USB charger points that I could not find"
3680,Wendy,2023-07-19,"Very comfortable, convenient stay. Excellent choice of continental breakfast for 4 a.m. start! Staff very efficient and helpful. Morning call delivered as arranged. (Very important) Location of hotel ideal for our needs. Very comfortable beds with ‘down’ filled pillows. Car parking would be expensive for long stay."
3681,Ian,2023-07-19,Take off from Bristol Airport Breakfast Room Location perfect for Bristol Airport
3682,Wilkins,2023-07-19,"Lovely but slightly marred by my cut thumb.= The beds were the most memorable. Very comfortable, good quality bedding and a lovely nights sleep. The restaurant. We enjoyed the basic menu and the setting with the lovely bar. However, the cleaning left a lot to be desired as I cut my right thumb on a sharp piece of glass that was down the seam of my seat. I ran my hand down the seam and felt a sharp sting. I reported to the staff and they filled out an accident report and provided me with blue plaster and antiseptic spray. They apologised, removed the glass but didnt even offer a glass of wine by way of apology."
3683,Glen,2023-07-19,Great location food was good bed was hard drinks expensive taxi’s extortionate Located on the airport Bed was hard Drinks were expensive Taxi to other venues were extortionate
3684,Darren,2023-07-19,Just as expected. Clean with friendly staff. Food was excellent Hotel was clean. Beds were comfy. Although the bed itself was comfy. The pillows were awful. Woke up sore.
3685,Cecil,2023-07-18,"Superb Location is great if you are flying. 5 minutes walk from the terminal. Breakfast is a bit basic, Choice is limited."
3686,Elizabeth,2023-07-16,Good Location and cleanliness. Good facilities. Bed was very uncomfortable and room expensive.
3687,Andrew,2023-07-15,My review The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was both plentiful and very tasty. Nothing springs to mind.
3688,Julia,2023-07-15,"Could be cheaper for a one night stay,leaving very early in the morning. But convenient and comforta Convenience to airport. More pricey than last year."
3689,Peter,2023-07-15,Fantastic location for flying from Bristol Airport Clean
3690,Natalie,2023-07-15,"Convenient location, comfortable stay Perfect location for an airport stay. Rooms are a nice size and bed comfortable. We left at 4am and had the option to take a continental breakfast with us All good"
3691,Joyce,2023-07-14,"Great location for Bristol Airport Location near airport good sized room, breakfast was good. Stopped here before would come back due to location. Getting a bit expensive. N/a"

3693,Stephen,2023-07-13,Superb Lovely
3694,Wish,2023-07-12,"My Stay at Hilton Enjoy this Hotel as was very convenient & close to the airport. Perfect location. Hotel itself was very clean and modern. The room itself was great as it had everything u need. Very comfortable bed and nice bathroom. No noise of the airport which was a bonus. Also the staff where Friendly and kindly hold are luggage for us so could have a day out in Bristol. I sorry to say that theirs a few things that disappointed me. One was the cost of the room for one night £175 which is expensive. Another thing that wasn't the best is the breakfast, I was so disappointed with it, considering what I paid. The full English was a big disappointment, no fry eggs, sausage where discussing, so was the scrambled eggs, bread too. Also the coffee was out of a machine, I could go on. Please sort it out, I wanted to complain but didn't have time as had to go."
3695,David,2023-07-12,Did the job but no great experience Convenient for airport and advance check in of luggage Early morning departure. At 4am no coffee unless paid for despite breakfast included in price. Flight departure at 6.30 meant no time to have anything.
3696,Helen,2023-07-11,"This hotel seemed less good than on previous stays while the price had increased. Pleasant room, comfortable and very convenient location. Great that they have provision for a help yourself continental breakfast for those who have to leave very early to catch a flight but the choice was limited. Evening meal quality was very poor with limited choice and smallish portions for the price. Continental buffet breakfast could be improved. Even though we were very early the fresh fruit platter was finished and had not been replenished.Generally there was limited choice."
3697,John,2023-07-11,"Excellent place to stay for an early flight. Staff could not have been more friendly. Nice clean comfortable room, decen Less than 5 minute walk to airport"
3698,Jade,2023-07-11,Great Friendly staff and the breakfast is lovely
3699,Michael,2023-07-11,"Nice clean hotel with well appointed rooms and good breakfast We booked a late check in and staff were were expecting us (at gone midnight). Breakfast was great, wide choice of food including vegetarian and vegan options. Room was good but the bed was far too firm. Bathroom was good. Super convenient for getting to the airport terminal, which is why you stay there! Bed was far too firm."
3700,David,2023-07-11,"Airport stay for early flight out and late back, adequet but cheap and cheerful would be better position for Bristol Airport. Price"
3701,David,2023-07-11,"Airport stay for early flight out and late back, adequet but cheap and cheerful would be better Airport hotel, excellent location for Bristol airport, rather expensive. Price, breakfast but as had early start not able to have but paid for."
3702,Lorraine,2023-07-11,Good for what we required Location to airport Nothing
3703,Catherine,2023-07-11,Room good restaurant more like a mid level cafe Convenience to airport. Easy walk Ripoff parking charges. Not even a drop off point for luggage. A £7 parking fee for 20 minutes unloading and getting into our room before taking the rental car back is beyond a joke.
3704,Celia,2023-07-10,"Perfect end to our holiday Location, comfort and friendly,helpful staff Nothing"
3705,Steven,2023-07-09,Good Location to air port Drinks to expensive
3706,Emma,2023-07-09,"Superb The staff at this hotel were absolutely faultless. I arrived after a long journey and they were very friendly and welcoming, which was a huge relief as I was travelling alone. The room was spotless and spacious and the breakfast offering was fresh and tasty. The price! It is such a convenient location when flying from Bristol, but it is overpriced for what it is and that is the only thing that puts me off returning."
3707,Davina,2023-07-09,Very good Bedrooms quiet which is important when you have to get up early for flight A bottle of water in room would be nice
3708,Natalie,2023-07-08,Pleasant and happy stay Gym facilities and very modern throughout. Couldn’t hear the aeroplanes Pillows weren’t very comfortable Tv didn’t have Netflix
3709,Catherine,2023-07-08,Very comfortable hotel but expensive. Very comfortable and quiet rooms. Restaurant was good and affordable. Convenient location. It’s very expensive for what it is. You are paying for the convenience of being located on the airport. Only you can decide if it is worth it. I had an early flight so the extra sleep and less stress was worth it this time but if I had a flight at a reasonable time I wouldn’t consider it.
3710,Dawn,2023-07-08,"Served it’s purpose well Location, ease of getting to departure terminal, food was ok with multiple options depending on time of day, rooms clean, email communication was quick Originally rang the venue to ask a question about booking in times as had had a flight cancelled at Gatwick so would be arriving very late, receptionist couldn’t answer the simple question of if they operated a 24 hour booking in desk? And after being put on hold for ages the call was disconnected, as I was already in a very stressful situation this wasn’t good"
3711,Jane,2023-07-08,"Makes an early start at Bristol Airport more bearable. Location next to terminal, size of room comfortable bed, quiet. Helpful staff. Departures listed and updated in hotel No flannels in the bathroom. Tea & coffee limited (no biscuits which would have been nice)"
3712,Kay,2023-07-07,Alright We ate in the restaurant but was very ordinary The plug sockets on the head board didn’t work
3713,Cherry,2023-07-07,Comfortable clean stay between flights. Excellent receptionist Proximity to airport Nothing
3714,Alison,2023-07-07,Very good Chose the hotel due to early flight from Bristol Airport. Can't get any closer than over the road! The cost is a little high for twin room overnight stay as you can't check in before 15.00 and we were out of the room by 4.30 am. 15.00 check in is a bit of a pain. Would be better with an option for an earlier check in.
3715,William,2023-07-07,Smart modern hotel Smart hotel in the perfect location Price!
3716,Marilyn,2023-07-06,"Not a cheap 1-night stay but well worth it for the great location & high standard of facilities Very helpful, friendly staff, great food selection at breakfast, lunch & dinner, so handy for accessing Bristol airport - just a short stroll to check-in. Lovely fresh decor in all areas and good-sized rooms. The option of a ground-floor room was a real bonus when travelling with heavy luggage. Room felt quite cold and I was unable to adjust the temperature. Not sure if I was having a 'senior moment' and not pressing the right buttons, but an instruction card for adjusting the heating would have been useful."
3717,James,2023-07-05,"Quick Didn’t have breakfast as flight was 6 o’clock in the morning. Due to delay only had room for one hour, so quick shower then back to the airport. No delays on flight from Edinburgh."
3718,Ashley,2023-07-05,"Value, efficiency and convenient.I would have no hesitation to stay again in future Proximity to airport after a late flight Breakfast ..... produce okay but not a fan of cafeteria style"
3719,Frances,2023-07-05,"Convenient and comfortable Convenient location for our needs. Room was big enough, clean and comfortable. Staff very welcoming and friendly. Nothing to dislike."
3720,Paul,2023-07-04,"Good pre-flight stop over, comfy bed, slept well :) Everything about the hotel optimised for easy air travel which is perfect. Little bit basic in terms of facilities, but to be honest given target market is basically people sleeping before they fly, I think that’s the right call."
3721,Mary,2023-07-04,"Superb We had a late flight into the airport so decided to stay over and drive home in the morning. Really glad we did. Room was comfortable, breakfast was good and the walk from the terminal was really short"
3722,Graham,2023-07-03,"Perfect location, great staff, but quality didn’t match price. Check in, staff friendly. Breakfast was good and so was the supper. When curtains closed in our room you had to put a light on. When sleeping it meant leaving a light on but none were dimmed enough not to keep us awake. The giant mirror in front of the bathroom door reflected the light throughout the room. That comment was for what we didn’t like. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. The bar area had seats which had had their cushions removed so we’re unusable."
3723,Liz,2023-07-03,"Good Room was very nice, bigger and brighter than I expected. Super handy for the airport, a three minute walk which was brilliant. Breakfast was okay."
3724,Mjbentley,2023-07-02,Surprising comfortable airport hotel ! Very efficient check in and comfortable rooms for an airport hotel. Very quiet! Food ....again efficient and above normal standards for an airport hotel. No decent decaf coffee!! Bar set up late at night needs attention. Quite a few people were waiting a long time for drinks.
3725,Elizabeth,2023-07-02,Very good All was good
3726,Sandra,2023-07-02,"Very good Fantastic for air travel being on the airport door step. We had only two teabags and two coffees and only a sweetner instead of sugar, for the money we paid i don't think it'd hurt to be a little more generous. We did an overnight for flight the next day and had no tea or coffee after break"
3727,Peter,2023-07-02,"Excellent accommodation for early morning flight, no worries of traffic jams! Location Nothing"
3728,Russell,2023-07-02,Good Close to airport
3729,David,2023-07-02,I would book again. Quiet and clean Poor ventilation in the bathroom and the water noises from above the room
3730,Annette,2023-07-02,Very good  Bed was too hard and could have benefitted from a memory foam mattress
3731,Virginia,2023-07-01,Great location Location in airport for early flight Breakfast included in stay The hamburger I had was awful
3732,Catherine,2023-07-01,"Very convenient for the airport terminals Great location, right next to the airport terminal Expensive rooms"
3733,Gary,2023-06-30,Would be happy to stay there again. Modern and the location. Excellent breakfast and staff working to provide it. Room doors have a tendency to slam shut. Rather disturbing.
3734,Stephen,2023-06-30,Very good  The sausages weren’t as good as last time tasted different
3735,Vera,2023-06-30,Recommended Spotless. Rooms nicely equipped. Breakfast that starts at 04:00 is great to catch early planes. No mini fridge in the room.
3736,Matthew,2023-06-29,"Used as like everyone else as there’s little alternative at airport Only picked due to location to airport and early flight Small room , well used room needs updating."
3737,Christopher,2023-06-29,"Like i said room and staff were good ,not the evening food/ The room was good ,location good. The breakfast was good but the evening food not good"
3738,Heather,2023-06-29,Check in was fast and efficient. No table service for bar/food but staff friendly. The location was perfect. The cost of the room was on the pricey side but I guess this is because you have a monopoly.
3739,Tracy,2023-06-29,Convenient Location. Short walk to terminal
3740,Alan,2023-06-28,"Good spot on the airport,clean rooms but disappointed in the breakfast, not value for money. The room was fine but the breakfast was 2nd rate,it starts off with good food and then it is let down by the cooking. The breakfast it was so second rate."
3741,Paul,2023-06-28,"Super, convenient hotel. Very clean hotel. The room was spacious and quiet. Bed was comfortable. Staff were friendly and attentive. We only used the room for a few hours due to arriving at the airport in the early hours and then travelling onward. Didn't get chance to have the breakfast. The experience in booking was very easy online and was easy to amend after an error on my part on booking the wrong day!! More milk in the rooms, please. Could breakfast run a little longer? We arrived at 4am and were very tired after an eight hour journey back to the UK. It was not possible to get down to eat in time."
3742,Paul,2023-06-28,"Hotel overnight visit Closeness to airport terminal Would have liked a hot breakfast, but due to our flight time only continental offered."
3743,Sandra,2023-06-28,"Very good The location is perfect, the staff were very helpful, the rooms are extremely comfortable, thank you I would have liked more choice of breakfast, there were few bananas, please have more next time"
3744,Jean,2023-06-27,Superb Great location
3745,Amanda,2023-06-27,Great as a stopover before you fly Location Nothing
3746,Lloyd,2023-06-27,"Excellent, brilliant location for late trips into the airport.  Shower difficult to obtain a good consistent temperature"
3747,Ian,2023-06-26,Good place to stay before an early flight. Very handy for the airport and helpful that they offer free parking while checking in and dropping luggage (we were parking at the Silver Zone park). As we had an early check-in for our flight we thought we would have to miss breakfast so were pleasantly surprised by the early continental breakfast available.
3748,Isabel,2023-06-26,"Superb The hotel is right next to the national Express bus stop and to the airport yet we didn't hear any noise whilst we were trying to sleep. The staff were very friendly. The room was spotless, shower was amazing. They also had a selection of games in the lounge area such as 'guess who' and 'battleships'. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The 'on the go' breakfast is NOT very good. It contained an apple, a cereal bar and a croissant. Considering you have breakfast included in the price and no option to remove it, I would consider a better 'on the go' breakfast for people who have early flights. For example, we had to leave the hotel at 4am and the hot breakfast doesn't start until 6/7am. A cold bacon/sandwich sandwich would have been better than a croissant in our opinion."
3749,Kingsley,2023-06-26,Very good This is the perfect stopover for flights that are either late getting in or early morning. It is right next to the terminal and far exceeded my expectation both with the staff and the facilities.
3750,Sue,2023-06-24,Have to stay here as no other alternative but very expensive although comfortable. location to airport after late flight. £160 and no water in room. Checking in at 0200 and receptionist more interested in offering us 10% off our next visit. We were tired! No fried eggs at breakfast and not available. Both coffee machines not working properly at breakfast. Can’t offer a parking deal as spaces owned by Bristol airport so whole thing very expensive.
3751,Andrew,2023-06-24,Excellent Excellent breakfast. Reduce room price per night
3752,Emma,2023-06-24,It was good apart from no breakfast Could not have any as flying out early. That I paid for breakfast included in the price but you could not provide a cooked breakfast before my early flight. Breakfast should be optional extra in the price as I paid for something that wasn't possible to have.
3753,Elaine,2023-06-23,"My flight arrived quite late in the evening so it was suitable for that situation. Room was very nice, clean and cool. Very nice helpful staff. Being old I struggled with the journey from terminal to hotel on foot with luggage. Food and drink prices very high and too much self service, given the prices."
3754,Claire,2023-06-22,Friendly staff and close to the airport proximity to airport restaurant and bar area drinks were expensive
3755,Lara,2023-06-22,Great nights sleep Very clean and comfortable
3756,Sara,2023-06-21,"expensive but convenient on airport site bedroom far to small, food average, drinks extortionate"
3757,Steven,2023-06-21,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
3758,Karen,2023-06-21,"Very good It was OK for 4am. An omelette would have been nice, not just coisonts and cereals"
3759,Sarah,2023-06-21,"warm, friendly and welcoming the rooms were clean, tidy and spacious enough the showers didn’t have a bath but were still big enough."
3760,Kathryn,2023-06-21,convenient when you have an early flight close to airport
3761,Jean-pierre,2023-06-20,"if food is improved, this will be a much better hotel overall room was practical and clean quality and choice of food was poor"
3762,Michele,2023-06-20,Unexpected Breakfast fab plenty of choice It was fine bit costly
3763,Catherine,2023-06-20,"Curate's egg The room was very comfortable and clean. The toiletries in the bathroom were lovely, and the towels were good. The continental breakfast was very poor. The ""orange juice"" was orange squash, there was hardly any food, and the tea was awful. I think perhaps the machine needed properly cleaned."
3764,Yacht-surveyor,2023-06-20,good for an early flight The location is great but you get wet going to and from the terminal if its raining too expensive
3765,Chris,2023-06-20,"overnight stay before early flight, very comfy night! very modern look about the place. upto dare decor. evening meal was excellent."
3766,Paul,2023-06-20,perfect for early flights super convenient for the airport. the staff were so friendly and helpful
3767,Sharon,2023-06-19,"stayed here after flight cancelled, definitely not worth the £220 for one night stay for solo traveler, location to airport very clean helping courteous staff the price way too expensive"
3768,Stephen,2023-06-19,Superb Did what it ment to for us. Nothing
3769,Jessica,2023-06-19,"Just across the airport, a great gym and breakfast buffet to enjoy before heading for the next stop Very short walking distance from the airport and a great gym--they had a Peloton! A bit pricey but you are paying for the convenient location so close to the airport"
3770,Louise,2023-06-18,Very expensive this year Convenience Restaurant sub standard and low quality. Menu has been the same for years. We always plan to not eat there but tiredness after travelling means we end up eating there.
3771,Su,2023-06-18,relaxed and comfortable. staff were helpful and friendly close to terminal. clean. helpful staff
3772,Gareth,2023-06-17,Very good Very convenient from Bristol Airport for a place to stay late at night after a flight from Barcelona. Saved driving straight home. Room nice and Clean. Breakfast was very tasty.
3773,Geraldine,2023-06-17,very satisfied Thé atmosphere in the hotel was relaxed but efficient. all the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful
3774,Rowan,2023-06-17,A good stay The proximity to Bristol Airport. was excellent. An easy check-in and good breakfast. The room was average sized and very clean. We were happy with the room Everything was good and no surprises.
3775,Glenn,2023-06-16,Good in parts Room and airport was good quick & easy access room was l9vely & comfortable and clean. Breakfast in a bag was poor not much food choice on evening menu plus not accepting cash card only.
3776,Sarah,2023-06-16,"Great staff and comfort - But the price is just robbery. I stay here every 12 weeks as I have an early flight to travel to work. As usual, the staff, comfort and cleanliness is great. It’s also very convenient having a place to get a drink and a meal on site. THE PRICE! It’s just absolute lunacy! £220 for one night B & B. I know market drivers etc. but there no need to fleece your customers. Unfortunately for us customers there aren’t really any compatible viable options in the locality."
3777,Ernest,2023-06-16,It did what we wanted. Did not use the breakfast. Room overlooked the dirty washing store.
3778,Linda,2023-06-16,"Will be booking again next year Excellent location as we had an early flight and very short distance to the departure area. The continental breakfast was good Not being able to be dropped off by the entrance to the hotel, it was a mad scramble to get out of the car at the roadside and we couldn't say goodbye properly to my husband .You have to pay an exorbitant fee to park for a few minutes"
3779,Julie,2023-06-15,Great location right next to the terminal buildings. The location is amazing! The breakfast was superb! The windows don't open in the rooms. The rooms are small. Could have been a bit cleaner - bleach will take care of mould straight away!
3780,Jill,2023-06-15,Comfortable stay but felt it was a bit overpriced Location excellent for the airport. Good bus service from centre of Bristol.
3781,Anthony,2023-06-15,All good - need invoice sent to me please Location and food Fire alarm and evacuation at 4am
3782,Gary,2023-06-15,good Closeness to airport
3783,Matthew,2023-06-15,Overnight airport hotel stay in Bristol Clean and comfortable. What is expected from a Hilton hotel. Very early breakfast (as of 4am) - perfect for early travellers. 10 minutes walk to Bristol Airport. A more varied menu choice from hotel restaurant. Dining area just next to main reception and it looked very busy to me.
3784,Stephen,2023-06-15,Thank you very much to all the staff at the Hampton by Hilton Everything was good the staff were really friendly and helpful the breakfast was good the room was clean we will be staying with you again thank you 😀
3785,Jodi,2023-06-15,"Convienient, comfortable and a great breakfast. Very close to the terminal. Nice room, bathroom, tv, sofa. Good wifi. Free, unlimited brekkie was excellent with lots of choices - just make sure you get there before it closes."
3786,Peter,2023-06-14,"Good hotel, very convenient location, and you have to pay for that. The hotel is very convenient for a very early departure time from the airport (we live two hours drive away). The welcome was very friendly, and it was easy to find our way around. It’s also very quiet. It’s an expensive stay (£200 for the night), but the only hotel that allows you to walk to the airport departure gates."
3787,Amanda,2023-06-14,For a last minute change to my plans it was a good place to stay This was a last minute booking as was supposed to fly out the same day but things didn't go to plan and I needed somewhere to stay for the night. The room was lovely; the staff were excellent and very helpful; and the food (both evening and breakfast) were to a high standard. I have to admit that I don't stay in hotels and the price did seem excessive- until I got there and actually saw the place. It was still expensive but I could see why.
3788,Geraldine,2023-06-13,"very convenient but expensive for a v short night proximity to airport I chose to book a room through the app, and get a digital key. reception then said they need to change my room. digital key arrived 90mins after I got into the room"
3789,Christine,2023-06-13,Great facility when you have an early morning flight Location to the airport and car parking
3790,Lauren,2023-06-13,"Good for being close to the airport Great location close to the airport. The hallways need the windows open, very hot walking up to our room carrying heavy luggage. The pillows are rubbish, not a very comfy night sleep with the pillows"
3791,Sally,2023-06-13,convenient and comfortable stay clean. convenient. good breakfast. 24h reception. comfortable bed. good shower. great soundproofing.
3792,John,2023-06-13,"Very pleased with our first stay at this hotel and will use again. Conveniently located to the bus stop and the Airport's departure entrance point. Room was clean with comfortable bedding. Excellent toilet/shower facilities. A good selection of cooked and continental breakfasts were available together with fruit juices/tea/coffee, etc. Very pleasant and helpful Reception Staff. Not much ....but the climb from the Hotel to the Airport's Departure point proved to be a bit of a challenge to my ageing legs."
3793,Amy,2023-06-13,"Quick stop over Right on airport, lovely staff, quiet rooms, and great breakfast options for earlier check outs. Our bathroom was an assessible bathroom, which I wouldn't really mind, but the water wasn't draining properly, and it seeped out of the bathroom. Bar meals a little basic."
3794,Laura,2023-06-13,"Great location, attentive and friendly staff and excellent buffet breakfast. Recommended Hotel easily accessed from Bristol Airport, even with suitcases/prams down the accessible slopes. Staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. We arrived at 12.30am and requested a cot. Two staff members met us when we arrived at the room and set it up very quickly so we could get the kids to bed. Room and rest of hotel was clean and tidy. The breakfast buffet included in the price the next morning was excellent. Great selection and coffee was good quality. Hilton Honours allowed us to extend checkout until 2pm for free, which was great as our flight wasn't until 3.30pm. Once we made the pull-out bed back into a sofa, the room was sufficient size for us to stay in for a few hours. Overall great stay, would highly recommend. We were a family of 4 (2 adults and 1 child and 1 infant), so selected a Queen room with pull out bed and cot. Room was a little snug once the pull out bed and cot were out, but this was fine for a 1 night stay. The next day we folded the bed back to a sofa which gave us enough room."
3795,Sandra,2023-06-12,expensive for an uncomfortable night location near airport and food good bed and pillows not comfortable

3806,Aileen,2023-06-09,"Over priced Perfectly situated right beside the terminal building with covered walkway for some of the way . Clean , comfortable and everything you need for an airport stay . The cost was ridiculous . Overpriced and taking advantage of the monopoly they have at this airport . We arrived at 1230am were up at 5 and it cost £220 ."
3807,Emma,2023-06-09,Good  The fire alarm going off at 4 in the morning! 3rd June.

3810,Jane,2023-06-08,"Superb Very reliably clean, comfortable accommodation. Near to transport away from the location when moving on. Friendly staff snd low key checking after midnight arrival was much appreciated. Nothing really"
3811,Deborah,2023-06-07,"Excellent location, comfort and service. Very comfortable beds which were hugely appreciated after a very long day travelling, and arriving at 3 am. Good blackout so not disturbed in the morning, and able to check out at 12 rather than 11 am. Excellent breakfast, very relaxed environment. Although it seemed expensive the convenience adjacent to the airport and the comfort offered made it worthwhile. Reception was a little slow, as the receptionist was perhaps inexperienced and needed assistance with the guests ahead of us. This was frustrating for us as we were desperate to get to our room!"
3812,Martha,2023-06-07,"a relaxing nights sleep after a late flight The location within walking distance to the airport is super handy. the room was very clean, beds very comfy, shower good. breakfast could have had a few more choices eg fried eggs, more pastry items like pan au chocolate (considering the price). It was very expensive"
3813,Susan,2023-06-07,"Perfect for an early morning flight Lovely staff, friendly and helpful. Very comfy beds. Very clran Felt it was a little pricey but worth it for the convenience"
3814,Neil,2023-06-06,"Location fantastic, staff friendly and helpful, breakfast served early. Location was fantastic from coach to hotel and from hotel to airport was just a short walk. Breakfast was available from 4am, great for early flights. Price was a little expensive considering it was cheaper to stay in similar hotels abroad. But the hotel was lovely."
3815,Arianam82,2023-06-06,Very good Great location Evening meal and breakfast was good. Very pricey
3816,James,2023-06-05,"Very good Really convenient, especially booking bags in the night before. Good room soundproofing key when people are getting up from 4am. £200 a night was expensive for effectively a slight nicer travel lodge"
3817,Tandy,2023-06-05,Very good but could improve bathroom hooks Comfy bed and proximity to airport Not enough towel hooks in the bathroom and the one towel hook was not fit for purpose as towel kept falling off the hook to the floor!!

3826,Dorine,2023-06-02,Very good Great room and very friendly staff
3827,Leanne,2023-06-02,"great for an over night stay. this hotel is ideally situated directly opposite the airport, with a path to access steps up to the Main entrance. it was perfect for one night stay over for an early flight. with a continental breakfast available from 4am, it’s brillant to grab and go. room was clean and spacious, we had the sofa bed prepare for our young son, it was perfect for him, but for and adult it would have been very uncomfortable. we hardly heard a sound from runway and had a good nights sleep. staff were very friendly and helpful, we arrived late, exhausted and grateful swift checking. the bed, now don’t get wrong we slept, but the bed felt very unstable and bumpy"
3828,Colin,2023-06-02,"Ideal for our needs with an early morning flight. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the airport terminal (up hill, although I understand there is a bus service if needed). Check in was quick and efficient, our room was clean and suited our needs. As we had an early flight the continental breakfast was welcome and had good choices, the hot food starts at 6am."

3835,Edward,2023-05-31,Convenient for Airport Convenient location for Airport
3836,Janet,2023-05-31,As a couple it’s pleasant but taking a grandchild to stay in the room too space becomes too compressed airport access proximity Sink layout too far away for a tall five year old to use without being lifted up plus room size when sofa bed made up isn’t good
3837,Beverley,2023-05-30,Good Liked how close to the airport it is and the facilities available. I thought a lot of the things where over priced for quantity especially the parking which I know is owned by the airport unfortunately and of I I'd known this before hand I would of added the extra day on the airport parking
3838,Margaret,2023-05-30,Flying visit! Excellent location for the airport We spent less than 12 hours in the hotel because we arrived late one evening for a very early flight the next day. However it served its purpose well and could not have been nearer the airport. We even had a grab and go breakfast at 4am nothing
3839,Ian,2023-05-30,Very good close to airport nothing not to like

3850,Valerie,2023-05-26,Very good Very clean and staff were very good We required 3 beds and we're given a double and a sofa bed.. The sofa bed was so so hard.. Not alot of sleep was had on it..
3851,Paul,2023-05-26,"Comfort and convenient stay but abusive tarifs. The comfort and location of the property were very good. The price being charged is abusing it's monopoly position of being the only hotel on the airport. The matter is made worse by only offering a tarif including breakfast, when many of its clients will only stay there due to a very early check-in time and not able to consume the breakfast, (4am in our case)."
3852,Eric,2023-05-26,"Very comfortable hotel in an ideal location for the airport It is ideal for an overnight stay, either before your flight or on your return."

3854,Elizabeth,2023-05-26,"Nice hotel, convenient especially for very late arrivals. Expensive comfortable bed, pillows and duvet, nice room this time with Queen beds. Night receptionist was excellent. All looked very cared for. Hotel full yet no noise disturbance. PLEASE, more lighting to the hotel, especially via the ramp, also, make the hotel sign bolder from the airport approach, and indicate which way the steps are and which way the ramp is please. Breakfast spread good other than the ‘traditional English’ No tomatoes, beans, black pudding(!) and on request for poached egg, was turned down and told nicely, “only scrambled egg”"
3855,William,2023-05-26,Superb Access to airport. Early breakfast available Bed was like lying on a plank
3856,Koji,2023-05-26,good location price
3857,Roland,2023-05-25,"Comfortable and convenient stopover hotel for the airport Comfortable room, excellent breakfast and very helpful staff. Ideal when arriving on a very late plane and not wanting an onward drive that same night. Finding our way from the arrivals terminal, although it was very close, to the hotel was unnecessarily difficult due to poor signposting of the route that avoided steps. We mentioned this to the hotel who said that the signage, unfortunately, was the responsibility of the airport."
3858,Dika,2023-05-25,"Great place to stay if you get in late. Right next to airport No fried eggs for breakfast, only scrambled (yuck)."
3859,Tim,2023-05-25,Adequate and good overnight stop off It’s not a top notch hotel but it’s perfect for an afternoon ver night stop before flying out. Food was ok nothing special but adequate. For what we wanted it was ok May be better selection of beers on tap!
3860,Heather,2023-05-24,Served the purpose of being close to airport for early flight Early start so wasn't fully awake!
3861,Jennifer,2023-05-24,"It met our needs and expectations for an overnight stay before catching an early flight. Staff were friendly and helpful. The airport is easy to access and very convenient. The room had everything we needed for a one night stay. We ate at the hotel in the evening and the system and the food was very good. A very good selection for breakfast. We had an early start so we were unable to have a cooked breakfast, which we would have had given the option."
3862,Danny,2023-05-24,"Airport hotel. Position, very easy to get to airport. Nice breakfast. Room good. For me the mattress was too hard, but I have a back problem so would probably be ok for most people."
3863,Helen,2023-05-24,"An expensive but convenient and comfortable option for the airport Very convenient for the airport (on site). Easy access with or without a car. The room was quiet, spacious clean and comfortable with a well equipped en suite. The restaurant provided a range of food and drink options. The staff were helpful and polite The price. I understand the premium location but the price is too high for the accommodation offered."

3866,Frank,2023-05-23,"A one night stop Location just outside airport entrance. Choice of meals was reasonable and the curry of the day was good. Rooms starting to look tired. Bed settee was opened as a bed but there were only two of us staying. Carpet under the bed did not look as if it had seen a hoover in a long time. No access to fresh air, window locked so had to use air conditioning. The continental breakfast was very poor with little choice."
3867,Vivien,2023-05-23,Everything went very smoothly and no complaints. All good and the cleanliness was excellent. Nothing only maybe a fridge in the room.
3868,Malcolm,2023-05-23,"Generally good and a welcome rest after ou flight Position, Breakfast was a bit disorganised"
3869,Ian,2023-05-23,Good property was clean and convenient for an overnight stay food at the restaurant was good. prices seems to have gone up again making it expensive for a single overnight stay.
3870,Peter,2023-05-22,Very good Location
3871,Patricia,2023-05-22,"Superb 10 minutes walk to departures Lack of labelling at breakfast. Very confusing layout. No fruit choices apart from an orange, apple or banana."
3872,Sarah,2023-05-21,I would certainly recommend to take the stress out of an early morning flight the proximity to the airport for an early flight was unbeatable not being able to pay with cash
3873,Wendy,2023-05-21,Superb How close to airport ...clean bright and airey ...lovely lady on reception very helpful and friendly...food was really good too Nothing
3874,Elena,2023-05-20,"Lovely hotel, very convenient location for an early start The hotel is lovely, very friendly staff, great food, very convenient location for an early start. A bit expensive"

3887,Catherine,2023-05-12,Chosen for convenience and pro to airport. Its proximity to the airport.
3888,Debbie,2023-05-12,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
3889,Suzanne,2023-05-11,"Great position, great staff, great breakfast, poor quality room. the position of it, friendly staff, good breakfast. Shower tray didn’t drain properly, general quality of room, fixings etc poor considering it was a Hilton Hotel."
3890,Terence,2023-05-11,"Adequate for purpose. Room was comfortable if a little cramped but most importantly was clean and adequate for one night stay before flight. Restaurant was more like self-service works canteen, tables were not laid-up and any semblance of intimacy was non-existent. Prices were not 'over the top' but certaintly more than adequate for the meal presented. Lack of acceptance of payment by cash is a very annoying trend which I feel is totally unwarranted and most definitely not 'customer- friendly'."
3891,Mathew,2023-05-11,Very good Perfect location right next to the airport for catching a flight. Sound proofing amazing. Couldn't hear any planes Breakfast was only cold but I was up at 4am. Hot breakfast served later but paid the same
3892,Laura,2023-05-11,"Perfect for short stay Superb location, only some minutes to airport. There was no possibility to open the window"

3894,Julie,2023-05-11,"Everything except the price was very good We’ve stayed before at a more reasonable price. This time it was very expensive and so we probably won’t stay again, eventho the location is perfect for making a smooth journey for my husband who has early onset alzheimer and needs gentle transitions. The high price"
3895,Paul,2023-05-11,"the hotel did what was required, it was convenient to the airport fir an early flight we chose the hotel because of its proximity to the airport and for that reason only property is looking a little tired in places, food choice average drinks expensive"
3896,Mrs,2023-05-10,"Overnight one night stay prior to travel Great location, good standard of accommodation for an overnight stay prior to travel abroad Basic facilities with a basic dinner and breakfast menu. Hadn't realised it had hotel parking"
3897,Lewis,2023-05-10,"excellent location for the airport, very clean, well run, great staff. excellent stay. Perfect to early and late flights. we had a sofa bed in our room, but no sheets or pillows, which was a bit of a let down considering the excellence in other aspects of the stay."
3898,Phillippa,2023-05-10,great airport stopover staff friendly - perfect for an airport stopover also was really (pleasantly) surprised to know a continental breakfast is available from 4am extra amenities available (for a cost) which was much needed for an early flight nothing.

3901,Joy,2023-05-09,Good  Very basic low end dinner menu
3902,David,2023-05-08,An excellent chilled out one night stay in the Hilton at Bristol airport. The location was very close to airport departures. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable. You could not hear any of the planes taking off or landing which helped. The early morning breakfast was tasty with plenty of choice. And express checkout did what it said on the tin. Hotel to departures pulling suitcases along the walkway took less than 10 minutes. There was nothing to dislike about the hotel or its facilities.
3903,Jill,2023-05-07,A lovely stay Very good Nothing to dislike.
3904,Laura,2023-05-07,Ideal for an early flight from Bristol airport Location was excellent to catch an early flight in the morning. Excellent food at the Bistro in the hotel. The room was very small for 3 adults and the sofa bed wasn’t comfortable.

3906,Lise,2023-05-07,"Very good Clean and friendly, good work facilities. The food. The restaurant menu is very limited and the quality of the food not great. Breakfast not great either - not very fresh. It used to be better prior to the pandemic."

3910,Taylor,2023-05-03,"Friendly, clean and convinient for the airport if you have an early start Friendly staff. We were offered a 'take away' breakfast when I explained that I was leaving very early in the morning but we didn't take it as we were leaving before the restaurant opened. The location was very close to the airport. Expensive. I have stayed at hotels on site at Gatwick for a fraction of the price. It was a better hotel but not worth four times the price."
3911,Noeline,2023-05-03,"Room good,staff friendly, let down by evening meal. Breakfast good, evening meal very limited,and long,long, wait between ordering and receiving food. Food menu,and delay getting it."
3912,Marc,2023-05-01,"Location good but you'll find better priced locally Friendly staff, clean room The usurious drop off fee No breakfast to go! No excuse for hotel next to airport with early flights to have no breakfast to go, especially at cost of room"
3913,Jason,2023-05-01,average close to the airport cooked breakfast was cold and not enough tea facilities in room
3914,Melanie,2023-05-01,"Good start and end to holiday. Very easy to get to hotel from airport. We used shuttle bus from Bristol train station and all went very smoothly. Hotel well signposted, although you can see it if you look to left from front of airport. Check in straight forward, breakfast plenty of choices and hot, evening meal very nice and no over priced. Pillows could have been a little firmer. Even using two still quite flat. Bed itself comfortable."
3915,David,2023-05-01,Good Location and cleanliness The breakfast setup
3916,Rebecca,2023-05-01,Excellent facility The staff at reception were very pleasant. The room was super quiet despite the hotel's proximity to the airport.

3924,June,2023-04-27,Superb Proximity to the airport. Room and facilities. Breakfast adequate for an early morning flight. The hotel is very expensive to stay and so is the food and drink. Menu has very little choice.
3925,Laurie,2023-04-27,Convenient but expensive hotel at Bristol Airport Location and comfortable rooms. Nice bathrooms. Price is way too high.
3926,Rinske,2023-04-27,Superb everything
3927,Hazel,2023-04-26,Comfortable and convenient. Hotel on site at the airport so only 5 minutes walk. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The breakfast was extensive and delicious.

3938,Stephanie,2023-04-22,Location perfect Friendly staff despite checking in at midnight. Room great and shower fantastic. WiFi no problem. Breakfast a good buffet available from 4am! Lots of sockets. Bathroom sink situated quite far back so big leaning required to be over sink. Picky maybe. An extending shaver type mirror would be useful. Again picky though.
3939,Cathy,2023-04-21,Ideal for Bristol airport. Less than 5 minutes walk to the airport. it seemed a little busy & chaotic when we arrived but it is an airport!

Whilst the selection of bar food was limited in terms of offering - the food was good quality & reasonably priced. Breakfast - excellent selection and hot. Location is outstanding - a 2 minute walk to departures. There was nothing that I felt was unsatisfactory - only minor gripes were the air conditioning/heating was loud (had to switch off) and the double bed was close to the wall - so difficult to get out on this side."
3948,Gaetano,2023-04-17,As I expected Location early breakfast close to airport Food
3949,Ray,2023-04-17,Only disappointment was lack of USB charging points. staff were very friendly and helpful. Very clean

3951,Bwh,2023-04-16,"Excellent airport hotel Our flight to Bristol was very delayed, and we didn't arrive until 230am. I called the hotel to warn them, and they couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. Comfortable, efficient room, and very decent breakfast."

3955,Helena,2023-04-15,"Exceeded our expectations This hotel exceeded our expectations. It was spotless, rooms were large and airy and the bed was so comfortable. The decor was super . 24 hour bar a great idea. Staff were FANTASTIC and could not have been more helpful. They bent over backwards to accommodate what we needed for a disabled person and made our airport stay far better than we imagined. We will definitely stay here again for our next flight . Only one thing we did not like was the continental breakfast, it was basically croissants , yoghurt and old fruit. It was really appreciated that it was open at 4 am but the choice of food and quality could have been a lot better ."
3956,Stuart,2023-04-15,as said previously very convenient for early flight out of Bristol airport. very convenient for an early flight out of Bristol airport. nothing.
3957,Ilja,2023-04-14,"Superb Breakfast was amazing as was the location, very convenient for us as we had to be up early (4.30am) to catch our 7.20am flight to Madeira. Continental breakfast was available from 4am which was perfect for us"
3958,Alan,2023-04-14,"Grateful for hotel, would stay again.2 Location very convenient, staff welcoming and helpful. Room a little cramped and shower a concern as I am disabled and floor slippery. A safety mat on shower floor, a change in bedroom arrangement."
3959,Giada,2023-04-14,"Very good Very convenient for early flights as it is right next to the airport. Good and clean facilities. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is excellent quality, but most items don't get restocked, so make sure you get there fairly early to have plenty of choice. Lovely hotel, but very overpriced for what it is. Unfortunately there is no real competition around, as it's the only hotel at walking distance from the airport. The price seems particularly high if you think that most guests (like us) only stay for a few hours, checking-in late evening and checking-out early morning. The sofa bed in the family room was very thin and uncomfortable. It would probably be ok for a child, but not great for an adult."
3960,Karen,2023-04-14,Superb Warm welcome despite being early hours after a delayed flight
3961,Abiodun,2023-04-13,The facility and the service was very satisfactory Everything went up to expectation The bed !

3967,Claire,2023-04-11,"Very convenient and comfortable stay Staff on check in were very friendly, room was good size, clean and comfy. Good soundproofing, barely heard an outside noise all night and slept well. Didn’t experience other facilities as left very early in the morning but so convenient to stay right next to airport and get a good nights sleep before an early flight. Bed was quite squeeky when I rolled over, and just wish the price was a little lower."
3968,James,2023-04-11,"Stayed twice and enjoyed both times. Only down side was the pouring rain on both occasions Position of hotel on airport for easy access , room and breakfast very good, Staff friendly and attentive including early morning call. More than happy with our stay - can't think of anything we didn't like!"
3969,Richard,2023-04-11,"Great for early departures Location is great for departures, just across the road. Used the multi-story carpark which is next door. On checking in found out we could have used the hotel parking but didn't see this as an option when booking. Nothing, all good."
3970,Nicolas,2023-04-10,"Good Walking distance from airport terminal. Requested regular double room, but found room made up with sofa bed that we put away ourselves. Breakfast was not as good as on previous visits."
3971,Paul,2023-04-10,"Perfect Airport hotel Great setup, serving food time very late and breakfast very early all reasonable quality for a airport hotel Rooms clean and perfect for a bed in a box concept The checkin can be slow if everyone hits the reception at yeh same time.

3986,Heidi,2023-04-04,"Had a great stay, it’s all very easy, looking forward to staying at the Hampton again. I love that it’s only a few minutes walk from the Arrivals at Bristol Airport. It’s so handy if you are coming in on a late flight or leaving on an early morning flight. Staff are friendly and the breakfast hours are great if you’re on an early flight. There’s a 24 hour reception. I found the room slightly cold and the bathroom floor very cold. It would be lovely if cloth slippers could be provided to help with this. It would help if there were more gluten free options at breakfast and things were clearly labelled for allergies, etc. Thanks."

4009,Craiglyn,2023-03-27,"Brilliant staff, convenient location and comfy room. We were travelling on a 6am flight with children so decided to book this hotel for the night before. Staff were excellent, hotel is very conveniently located with a short covered walk to the terminal and the multi-storey car park is right next door. Dinner was really nice and while I cannot comment on the official breakfast because we had to be in the airport before it started, a really nice touch they provided a small breakfast bag which was perfect to tie the kids over until we could get on the plane. We had a double room with a sofa bed which was perfect for the kids, really comfy stay. Would definitely recommend for a nice layover or for making an early morning flight more convenient."

4015,Valerie,2023-03-23,"Good nights sleep and perfect location for the airport. Take away breakfast was awful,, orange juice, banana, chocolate pastry and Alpen bar, the pastry was so dry we threw it away, then needed to buy breakfast at the airport. Next time I would take the breakfast from the early morning buffet. Room was lovely but little pieces of glass by the bathroom door and by the side of the bed. take away breakfast needs to improve. I wa unable to find out if there was a restaurant for evening meal before we arrived and was unaware they have their own parking on site."
4016,Wendy,2023-03-21,pleasant and great way to start your holiday abroad location staff and comfort location and comfort
4017,Catherine,2023-03-21,"Great location Great location and room was adequate Slightly over priced, bed a bit hard"
4018,Barbara,2023-03-21,Love the convenience of the hotel near the airport especially on a very late arrival back to Bristol Had a great time even for the one night due to flight delayed upon arrival at the airport. Good to know there's a faster convenient way to get to the hotel. Breakfast closed up a little early for late check in guest. Whilst I understand that 10am was the last call. Perhaps the hotel can look into late check in guest perhaps offering a room service breakfast or a later time like 10.30am specifically for us
4019,Rachael,2023-03-20,great everything nothing really
4020,Angela,2023-03-19,"lovely , helpful staff. excellent room location"

4027,Christopher,2023-03-16,"Exactly what we needed for the night before flying. Breakfast was nice, room comfy. Air con was not working and room cold."
4028,Lee,2023-03-16,"Very good Very close to airport, exceptionally good staff. Shower didn't drain properly but staff were getting it sorted as soon as we left."
4029,David,2023-03-16,Very good One night stay before our flight. Comfortable room - surprisingly quiet - and good breakfast. Reception staff friendly and efficient. On airport so no drama on the morning of our flight - just a short walk. The price is a bit high and it would be better to give a choice of available airport car parking with the booking - not everyone wants outdoor parking in the winter.
4030,William,2023-03-15,"Very good Good room, great breakfast, very convenient for early morning flight Breakfast available at 6 am"
4031,Kevin,2023-03-15,all good definitely use again it’s location for the airport parking is expensive

4033,Amy,2023-03-13,"Excellent, convenient and easy. Excellently designed room and bathroom - everything needed was there. Everything was new, fresh and spotlessly clean. Couldn't have asked for more for our quick stopover. The high tables in the bar had a sticky finish meaning crumbs etc. stuck to the table and couldn't be brushed away."
4034,Elizabeth,2023-03-13,Very good Proximity to airport
4035,Joanne,2023-03-12,"Perfect hotel for when you flight is cancelled and your next flight is the next night! My flight from Bristol was cancelled due to snow so as I had stayed at The Hampton previously, I instantly knew to book quickly as there was going to be a lot of people needing rooms that night. The hotel is the perfect location as its just across the road from the airport. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, which I don’t remember being the case on my first visit. I had dinner in the hotel and I have to say that it was better than I expected and not a bad price. Breakfast was a good selection. I do think the rooms are expensive but I get that you are paying for the convenience of being so close to the airport, plus being the closest, they can charge those prices and still get the guests."
4036,Alexandra,2023-03-12,"Handy stay for the airport As close as you can be to the airport very handy. Food was reasonable, comfortable stay food room. Freindly staff. Continental breakfast was basic. Problem with the heating although heaters were in place. Price high, it is convenient but there are local b and bs offering better breakfast and cheaper price."

4038,Margaret,2023-03-12,"Very good Perfect for what we needed for an early flight, have used this hotel before and will do again, even managed a quick breakfast which was good. USB points are now essential and surprised you don’t have any but staff loaned us two so we charged ready for going through security. Our Only complaint"
4039,Janet,2023-03-11,Serves its purpose well. Perfect airport location. Short walk to terminal. Staff friendly & helpful - especially Nick in the bar. Clean modern rooms. Dining facilities more like a cafe than a restaurant.
4040,Zvezdanova,2023-03-11,Convenient stay near airport Location is great. Just a few minutes walk to the airport. I could not open the window to get fresh air.

Quite pricey for one night …but it did include full breakfast which was substantial.
4052,Jane,2023-03-07,We often stay here when travelling abroad. Ideally located by the terminal. Breakfast included. Spotless accommodation. Charming staff. Handy for airport but also for buses to return home. Bar area can be a bit chilly.
4053,Clare,2023-03-07,"Good Room Breakfast. Coffee good, croissant stale. Walk to terminal from hotel longer than I expected and not all of it under cover."
4054,Rundle,2023-03-07,Solo traveler Everywhere was very clean. The room was comfortable and spacious. The food was great & so were the staff. The staff were very accommodating. There was nothing from this stay that I didn't like.

4067,Chris,2023-03-03,Excellent stay but expensive ! We have stayed many times as it so convenient for early or late flights. Good quality rooms and staff polite and friendly. The price now is very expensive for this grade of hotel.

4075,Julia,2023-02-28,"Good comfort in great location Loved that good choice of food available before 5 am check in , Continental starts at 4 am great to just walk to airport . As a single traveler over 65 the cost & being as stress free as possible was worth it ."
4076,Gordon,2023-02-27,"A welcoming place to still with nice rooms and great staff A comfortable clean room. The staff were friendly, welcoming and professional. A great team, and a good night's sleep! No problems staying there again. Not much not to like. Maybe the food (I had a jacket potato) could have been better. But that was made up for by the friendly service."

4082,Fiona,2023-02-26,"A perfect overnight stay in a conveniently located airport hotel. Impressed by the wide variety of food at breakfast and clean layout of self service area. Waffles were fun to make. Quality of the food we ate was good. We didn't go for a cooked breakfast. Bathroom was excellent, loved the shower. Very comfortable bed and lovely soft pillows. Didn't hear any planes! Good size room which was very clean and ordered. We appreciated the lit pathway from the airport to the hotel after our late flight arrival."
4083,Yacht-surveyor,2023-02-26,OK its a good option if you have an early flight quite a long check in wait
4084,Roger,2023-02-25,"Excellent for early flights Breakfast served at 4AM! Excellent if you need to catch the 6AM Flight Restaurant didn't take orders at table. If you travel alone that's annoying, you'd have to leave your belongings unattended or drag them along every time you want a refill."

4086,Hilary,2023-02-25,"Very convenient to the airport. Very clean, comfortable bed, very good hot breakfast. Nothing."

4089,Huw,2023-02-24,Excellent - will definitely come back and will probably choose Bristol airport again as a result. All excellent. Thought equal opportunities policy for staff was very refreshing. Breakfast was outstanding. Was encouraged to sign up for Hilton Honours via the messaging system on Booking.com but when I checked in I was advised that I wouldn’t get the points BECAUSE it was through Booking.com Woyid have appreciated a bit more transparency on that front.
4090,Chris,2023-02-23,modern clean comfortable friendly modern clean comfortable friendly
4091,Donald,2023-02-23,ok Breakfast and being close to airport Didn't get bill at checkout and not been sent yet
4092,Jasper,2023-02-23,"Convenient location at Bristol airport with excellent service and a nice breakfast. The hotel was in a perfect location for me as I needed to be close to the airport for work. Great connection by bus to Bristol city too. I enjoyed the coffee during breakfast a lot, breakfast in general was nice, breakfast area was also clean and staff was ready to help anyone out where needed. The staff at the hotel in general are very friendly and ready to answer any questions. The room was refurbished, was spacious and had all items one could need during a stay. The bed linnen had some area with a glue-like deposit on it which should have been picked up by the person preparing the room and it should have been replaced. I managed to get the deposit off myself though and it didn't bother me anymore."
4093,Brian,2023-02-22,ideal for early flight very early buffet breakfast available before flight

4099,Chris,2023-02-20,"Provides what it promises - convenient, clean and comfortable A good location and well soundproofed so no noise from the airport operations. Friendly staff, food was served quickly food is a bit commercial - not a huge range either - but ok for the setting I guess"
4100,Janet,2023-02-20,Very good Easy walk to terminal early morning. Grab and go bag for breakfast before restaurant opened was a really good idea.
4101,Mary,2023-02-20,"Paying for location convenience right by hotel For a relatively expensive hotel it all felt a bit basic. Even loo roll was cheap - whole vibe no better than a Travelodge but three times the price. Queuing to order and pay for very basic evening meal menu seems at odds with the price per night. Staff all friendly and helpful though, and location excellent."
4102,Michaela,2023-02-19,"Good Very clean. Nice room. Good size. Nice bar/restaurant Lack of fridge, no water to drink in the room, and also nothinf complimentary. Very uncomfortable pillows...as too soft. Overall is good but with a price of 170 per night i was expect something little more."

4107,Kasia,2023-02-18,"Super friendly hotel This hotel is close to the airport, very quiet and friendly - Krystyna at the front desk was superb helpful! We only stayed for 1 night but had an amazing evening and night at the hotel. Our flight was at 6am so we only had cold breakfast (bread with butter and cheese) as anything hot is served after 6am. Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely come back. Hot breakfast to be served earlier and fridge in the room."

4115,Linda,2023-02-16,Serves a perpose Convenient for a very early flight I think the dropping off is very confusing As one does not have time to read all the notice on arrival With cars waiting to get in behind you Not good
4116,Rosalind,2023-02-15,Perfect for early flight. location Price of food and drinks in noisy bar area.
4117,Diana,2023-02-14,"Very good Very helpful and friendly reception staff. Good downstairs area to eat and drink, I enjoyed seeing what was going on. The beds are a bit hard and on the little tea tray there was only enough milk for one mug of tea/coffee each."
4118,Gemma,2023-02-14,"Good Breakfast was excellent, the bed very comfy and staff helpful. The room was adequately clean, although the carpet could do with a bit more attention. The air con or heating was quite noisy. Generally it was as I expected, and I was satisfied with my stay"
4119,Richard,2023-02-13,All good & will stay again. Room clean & comfortable .. excellent location for travel to/from Bristol Airport. A pedestrian path from multi story car park to hotel entrance.

4123,Charlotte,2023-02-13,Convenient for an early morning flight Proximity to airport. Nothing fancy but comfortable. The breakfast was OK.
4124,Patricia,2023-02-13,"Overall it adequately served the purpose for which it was required. Would use again if necessary. The room itself was comfortable and the beds were a good size. There was a nice big vanity mirror with good lighting. Found breakfast a little disappointing, maybe because it was exactly the same as we had been experiencing for all our breakfasts on holiday. The bacon was tough and a little hard to cut. The sliding door to the bathroom in our room was very difficult to move and it took all of my strength to open it."
4125,Ashley,2023-02-13,Superb Comfort and convenience
4126,Geoffrey,2023-02-13,Convenient and comfortable. Location unbeatable if you have an early flight. Just a very short walk across to the terminal. Good to be able to get a Continental breakfast from very early too. Super comfy beds. Nothing really.

4128,Nicolette,2023-02-13,"Very good The location for the airport was excellent, wake up and roll over to the airport. The added bonus about staying so close to the airport is that you can check-in your luggage the night before (with certain Airlines - Easy jet and TUI)"

4135,Jason,2023-02-10,"A very pleasant brief stay The location was perfect, the staff were really friendly and helpful at all interactions. The room was very clean and had just what I needed for a very brief stay. Nothing really everything as as expected or better than to be honest, due to my early flight I did not have breakfast so cannot comment on this aspect."

4141,Wayne,2023-02-08,"Decent airport hotel Hotel is OK in general. Decent rooms and food was OK too. Cant comment on the cooked breakfast as we only had a continentals due to the flight time, but it was good enough. Like every other Airport hotel, its not the cheapest but you pay for the convenience, and its modern."
4142,Heather,2023-02-08,"We stayed before collecting a hire car next day so had limited choice. Pleasant reception staff.Twin room better use of space than the doubles. Room heating worked. breakfast ok.Short walk from terminal to hotel. Bar staff refused to accept cash for dinner order ""company policy is card only"". Tough on those without a card, we won't eat there again for dinner. Catering style was canteen- order at bar, collect your own cutlery, food delivered to table, not a great experience."

The staff kindly arranged the airport to pick us and our baggage from the entrance."

4149,Leon,2023-02-06,in the end frustrating convenient for my husbands work place unfortunately we had a call from reception day before we were due to leave at 11.45 to remind us of 11.00 checkout so I had to phone my husband to make sure our dates were correct which they were no apology about their mistake ?
4150,Kate,2023-02-06,"Comfortable hotel, sooooo close to the terminal. Perfect The staff at check in and check out were extremely helpful and so friendly. The staff in the bar and food area too were very nice. Food was easy to order and quick to arrive. As for the room, very comfortable and quiet too which was just what I needed before an early flight. I wish I had know the parking cost before hand and then I would have parked for my whole time in the multi storey car park."

4157,Yacht-surveyor,2023-02-05,"Very good very close to the airport terminal, made my check-in for my flight very easy Its pricy for just a few hours overnight but what you expect from a hotel so close to the terminal"
4158,Ken,2023-02-05,Ok  Breakfast was a bit poor only one coffee machine working not a good selection of fruit and cereal
4159,Andrew,2023-02-04,"handy for early flights 5min walk to departure, able to get breakfast from 4am evening food not up to much"
4160,Angela,2023-02-04,"Very good The breakfast offering was amazing, fresh, and plentiful. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. That you are unable to open a window in the room"

4162,Michael,2023-02-03,"comfortable modern hotel next to the airport right by the airport , comfortable clean rooms , helpful and polite staff and was good value"
4163,Nathan,2023-02-03,"Great location, recommended. Great location, easy parking, recommended. Rooms were clean, tidy and comfortable. Highly recommended property. Car parking could be free for guests, that being said - its the norm for airport hotels."
4164,Heidi,2023-02-03,"very pleasant and would use again clean and friendly broken automatic door, lack of lighting in corridors before lights should be on, car parking too expensive if you are staying for one night?"
4165,Manuel,2023-02-02,Very comfortable. Good selection for breakfast.
4166,Paul,2023-02-02,it met our needs before a very early flight Take away breakfast was hopeless . The fruit was past its best and the croissant was very bland . We left most of it see above
4167,Denise,2023-02-02,excellent tostay after late night arrival or early morning departure clean and comfortable
4168,Mhairi,2023-02-02,"Superb convenience, early breakfast, super comfortable beds."
4169,Patricia,2023-02-01,"Excellent location for the airport. Hotel is next door to the airport so excellent location. Breakfast starts at 4.00am, even if you don't eat have coffee, its really good. As with all airport hotels it is very expensive but if you want the convenience of the location you have to pay."
4170,Neil,2023-02-01,Always handy for early flights Room and bed comfortable Proximity to airport Dining area a bit too cafe like and it was cold
4171,Owen,2023-02-01,Perfect for an early flight If you're looking for an easy spot to make it easier to get to a very early flight then you can't do better than this. A one minute walk to the terminal. Hotel itself is exactly what you want from a Hampton.
4172,Bernie,2023-02-01,lovely hotel but need to sort the big problem you have with the heating staff was super friendly and so close to the airport very clean staff could not be more helpful
4173,M,2023-01-31,"Superb The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable and the breakfast plentiful. The location within a short walk of the airport is superb. The free one hour stay for drop offs is very welcome, though needs better visibility. The lack of snacks (cakes, biscuits) to go with a cup of tea or coffee is disappointing."
4174,Alan,2023-01-31,"Good Convenience to airport. Increased warmth of public areas from previous stays. No rose wine. When I asked for a small red wine I was given a spirit sized measure! When I asked for complimentary water got told there was a tap in my room.. Asked for fried eggs at breakfast, was told ""we don't do fried eggs on Tuesdays"". People skills lacking all round. Also, rooms badly designed with one side of the bed only about one foot from the wall."
4175,Howard,2023-01-31,"Very good All very good, pleasant staff, good evening meal at reasonable price, clean and comfortable room, excellent choice for free breakfast. Would definitely stay there again."
4176,Mj,2023-01-30,"Very good The availability and position of the hotel. Friendly, welcomed by staff. Clean rooms.... Breakfast was more limited than in the past..... acceptable but a bit minimal. ."
4177,Jennifer,2023-01-30,it was ok but we had to miss breakfast as ourcheckin was 4am the time breakfast started ☹️ near airport could be less expensive
4178,Lee,2023-01-29,very good proximity to airport comfortable and well appointed shower was great nothing
4179,Keith,2023-01-29,"great value and location perfect 👍 it’s so convenient the location I didn’t get my booked early call ! a relative told me the early breakfast was a takeaway,so we went down to pick up on way out and found it wasn’t ,so no time to eat there 😩"
4180,Alison,2023-01-28,"It was great to arrive in a such a welcoming place, both before departure - and on our return. This hotel is the only one at the airport, so it could not fail, but its proximity to it certainly made for a very relaxed departure and arrival. The rooms were not huge, but the beds being very comfortable made up for that and the toiletries provided: shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand wash and body lotion were good quality which made a welcome change as I did not need to unpack may own. The staff were, without exception, all lovely and helpful and pleasant. it would have been good if the bathroom door had been lightproof, so as not to disturb the other guest when needing to get up in the night! It was made with a see-through perspex panel. Also - shutting it made a loud sound and leaving it open to avoid this meant that one was reflected in the mirror opposite the door, whilst doing what you needed to - thus giving one's sharer a great view! We laughed about this, but you may not be aware! Secondly, the entrance area which is filled with tables for guests to drink and eat and meet was looking a bit tired with a few things scratched or peeling and in need of a bit of a refresh, décor-wise to properly meet the star standard."
4181,Anne,2023-01-28,convenient location location next to airport. comfortable. good breakfast. a bit cold in reception areas. expensive
4182,Nigel,2023-01-28,Very good close to airport parking having to pay to park at hotel

4188,Jonathan,2023-01-26,"Pleasant and worth it if you have an early flight. It was very clean, walking distance to the terminal which was ideal for early morning flight, good breakfast. Evening meals available which are reasonably priced and ours were very tasty. It would be very pricey for a solo traveller if I were to come again alone."
4189,Jeroen,2023-01-24,Good hotel close to Bristol Airport Close to airport
4190,Paula,2023-01-23,"Jess … went way beyond service , she looked after me on every level … spacious , comfortable , lovely staff"

4210,Susan,2023-01-14,loved the hotel but wouldn’t stay again because of having to struggle with cases 🛫 food and bedroom the location was not as advertised exactly . had to drag cases up an incline as I am disabled .
4211,Ian,2023-01-14,"very good nice relaxed atmosphere clean, modern,nice rooms. I would have liked fried eggs for breakfast rather than scrambled"
4212,Adrian,2023-01-14,Good airport hotel let down only by the food very clean Close to the airport Good rooms Bed was over firm for our liking Food quality was mediocre for the money charged
4213,Mike,2023-01-14,"Limited options in the area but this is a good option Just a few minutes walk from the terminal building. Clean and spacious lobby and reception area. Food wasn’t the best (quality or value) but what do you expect at an airport hotel, it was perfectly adequate for a night. Room was clean, reasonable size and bed good quality. Food could be a bit better, perhaps need to remember that there will be repeat visitors. I will use this airport regularly but might consider alternative eating arrangements."
4214,Graham,2023-01-14,Prepared to fly Ideal location for overnight stay before flying. Meals a bit average tasting. Needs better assistance to transport people with heavy cases to airport. Employ a helper with an electric vehicle
4215,Victoria,2023-01-13,"Clean comfortable rooms, very friendly staff, fabulous breakfast Perfect place to stay close to the airport, clean comfortable rooms"
4216,Keith,2023-01-13,Okay but blooming expensive A 5 minute walk from the airport and breakfast from 4am so great for early flights. It was £132 for a nice but ordinary room. It does feel they charge extra for the absence of alternative airport hotels.
4217,Uk,2023-01-12,Good airport hotel. Great location for an early flight. Comfortable and all you need. A bit pricey.
4218,Paul,2023-01-11,"brilliant for airport stay, friendly staff staff very friendly, room big, modern and clean, shower decent, very quiet hotel breakfast slightly cold, expensive 1 night stay"
4219,Ocs1103,2023-01-11,Very good Staff were all nice and friendly Staff moved us from an interconnected room when I expressed at checkin that I did not want an interconnected door. Restaurant/ Bar was good No fridge in room No room service
4220,Beverley,2023-01-11,"Location! Lovely welcome, nice bar area, ample breakfast ! Nice comfy bed! Limited food menu and a little overpriced"

4224,G,2023-01-09,"Airport hotel, exactly as advertised. Excellent location, short walk to airport terminal. Staff were friendly and helpful. We ate in the hotel, not a massive choice but basic and all served hot."

4228,Kevin,2023-01-09,"Unexpected stay Everything was good, we stayed as we were flying at very early next day. It is nice to get up have a breakfast and walk across road, so works for us. Everything was fine."
4229,Malcolm,2023-01-09,Very good Great location for airport Staff helpful and friendly Restaurant facilities satisfactory with quick service Room comfortable Shower didn't drain properly Water not hot enough
4230,Jain,2023-01-09,handy for the airport close to the terminal cleanliness of the public toilets
4231,Adam,2023-01-08,"convenient modern rooms, near the airport for early flight staff were very disorganized and four staff said different things when it came to their loyalty scheme and costs etc there was definitely a lack of training even when it came to buying snacks and drinks isn’t the daytime"
4232,Dale,2023-01-08,Great location easy check in and out. Staff helpful and room clean just need an idiots guide to the Location great Never understand how those room heaters work.
4233,Johannes,2023-01-07,"Very good Perfect location in walking distance from the terminal. Cosy atmosphere and nice room It would be nice if they could offer power adapters (eg for a deposit). We were on a stopover, and couldn’t connect our electronic devices in the room"
4234,David,2023-01-06,extremely convenient place to stay particularly with a very early flight very close to airport. cleanliness. lots of space. very helpful staff. all good
4235,Michael,2023-01-05,"Superb Convenient, quiet for an airport, god food and pleasant staff."
4236,Sarah-jayne,2023-01-05,convenient location great location and very clean and comfortable. check in staff are always very friendly and helpful restaurant and bar can feel like an extension of the airport which is only to be expected. good choices a bit limited but what is available tastes good.
4237,Jim,2023-01-05,Perfect located hotel for late night arrivals or early no departures Proximity to the airport given that I arrived on a late evening flight. Breakfast had some dodgy scrambled eggs rather than fried eggs (you can tell I am struggling to find something bad about the hotel ! )
4238,Debbie,2023-01-05,Great for night before a flight very good access to airport. friendly staff comfortable and clean
4239,Richard,2023-01-04,"All good except for the room temperature Location, food, size of room, shower Couldn't get the room warm but was too tired to do anything about it. Went to bed in clothes. The aircon unit was pumping out only cooled air, even when I set it to 25 degrees."
4240,Claire,2023-01-04,"Handy We've stayed before & it is excellent if you have an early or late flight, although it is a fair walk from the airport. Sounds petty, but the loo seat didn't fit the loo, and the toilet paper was really thin and cheap. Probably used twice the amount of paper, so I think it was a false economy on their part."
4241,Margaret,2023-01-04,Very good accepted dogs
4242,Amanda,2023-01-03,"spotless, comfortable in perfect location proximity to the airport at busy times can be untidy in the restaurant area"
4243,Janet,2023-01-03,"good airport hotel . staff good rooms good fir the money. clean , resturant. easy to find the walk to the airport . what a shame it’s not an absolute direct link up . if it’s raining you get wet as the “tunnel” doesn’t link up directly."
4244,David,2023-01-02,perfect pre-flight hotel with excellent staff perfect for the flight from the airport the next morning. room window catch was broken so couldn’t air the room which was a bit stuffy.
4245,Toby,2023-01-02,"Convenient, comfortable, and worth the price + breakfast Very convenient for airport. Breakfast was varied - continental from 4 am and full English from 6 am. Tied in well with flights and makes sure you start off with a good breakfast! Would be perfect if check-in time was around 1 pm."
4246,Phillie,2023-01-02,Very good In the heart of the airport. Very comfortable rooms. Nice staff. Good breakfast with many options for lactose and gluten free. Toilet paper is beyond dreadful!
4247,Deborah,2023-01-02,Very good Breakfast Access with suitcases.
4248,Jason,2023-01-02,"Superb Everything else, but breakfast. Kind of leaves a bad memory in your mind as you head away from the property. A little disappointed with the choice of breads available and fruit at breakfast. Medium sliced table loaves and frozen summer berry fruit fruit don’t really cut it at this price."
4249,Christina,2023-01-02,Very good Very close to Airport & Tasty breakfast No bathroom with bathtub & expensive rates
4250,Alison,2023-01-01,great convenient hotel for airport but will not use again unless a good deal on the price arrives very close proximity to airport especially when able to check in our case the night before. staff very friendly and efficient and food OK. price has increased considerably since it opened. first paid about £70 per night and have stayed 4 times. price increased every time but was £144 this time with parking extra.
4251,L,2023-01-01,"Comfortsble and very convenient Clean, ideal proximity to the airport as our flight was in the early hours of the morning. I initially drove into the “drop off” area and was worried I’d have to pay £5 at the barrier to get out. Better signage please."
4252,Lee,2023-01-01,"convenient and pleasantly looked after. clean and tidy , very convenient for airport , staff were nice. not much , bed a bit hard for me and food a beverages a little pricey."
4253,Hannah,2023-01-01,good stay - decent airport hotel. after service to resolve issue with random payments taken from account not so good - comfy beds. decent breakfast and good service whilst at the hotel the hotel took multiple payments from me of significant amount. whilst Chelsea who I initially dealt with was extremely helpful and tried to help I still have not received all the refund as subsequently staff have not listened to or fully I understood the issue
4254,Tim,2022-12-31,the only on airport hotel so it’s worth the price excellent location and nice rooms
4255,Anita,2022-12-30,It’s very convenient for the airport but overpriced. Convenient for the airport. Comfortable and clean rooms. Food isn’t great. No hairdryer or usb ports which I would expect at the high price charged. Badly planned rooms - E.g. no thought given to plugging your hairdryer in and actually being anywhere near a mirror.
4256,Andrew,2022-12-30,very good except for bed receptionist ( young blonde lady) was particularly helpful to us. she deserves full marks and will go far in life bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. this was the only bad point about our whole one night stay .
4257,Jo,2022-12-29,"Very convenient and comfy, if you need to stay at the airport. Friendly, helpful staff. Lovely room and bright modern bathroom. Nice that conditioner was supplied. Friends came for a drink and were able to park for a couple of hours for free, which I really appreciated. Before arriving, it was tricky to discover whether there was a restaurant, or just breakfast; also the parking situation. I feel that these things could be promoted better, as both are positive additions to the hotel 😊"
4258,Elizabeth,2022-12-29,"An excellent option for an early flight from Bristol Airport We booked this hotel as we had a 7am flight and we did not have a car. It is a very short walk along a dedicated path across to the airport. Also, a continental breakfast was available from 4am which was excellent. The room was very spacious and well-equipped and the heating worked well. It is relatively expensive as it is the only hotel at the airport but it was worth it for the peace of mind."
4259,Richard,2022-12-29,fantastic english breakfast across the road from the airport. the english breakfast was fantastic direction/signage to the hotel can be much better
4260,Dennis,2022-12-28,Superb Pretty much everything. The room was very good with a comfortable bed. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent. The walk to and from the hotel in the rain
4261,David,2022-12-28,very convenient location but a few minor issues could be improved. Hotel is the only one on the actual airport site so location is good and you don’t need a courtesy bus. Food in the restaurant was standard stuff but good. Rooms are comfortable and quiet and breakfast albeit continental is on from 4:00 am as many staying are on early flights. Good welcome from reception. The hotel is much lower than the terminal building and even roll along bags require either a climb up several steep flights of steps or a lengthy walk up a series of ramps. There is a short covered section but got soaked walking to the terminal in heavy rain. can’t imagine why a covered way isn’t possible. Restaurant area is getting tired now and for our evening meal (self service)it was difficult to find a clean table.
4262,Linda,2022-12-28,Very good Very near airport for early flight
4263,Pamela,2022-12-27,"Bright and clean Beds comfortable, very clean, staff helpful and polite. We had to leave light on in toilet/shower room at night to enable my husband to use toilet safely. The only problem was that the majority of the door is glass and there was also a large mirror opposite, meaning not only was the light in the bathroom shining but also reflected by the large mirror in entrance area, looks very nice and bright, but meaning that the bedroom area was lit up all night, not conducive to a good nights sleep by any other person in party."
4264,John,2022-12-27,Enjoyed the stay. Not the parking charge Room was great. Parking charge was outrageous Overnight parking charge
4265,Nicola,2022-12-26,"Superb Clean, comfortable room. Good breakfast. The drinks were rather expensive in the restaurant."
4266,Margaret,2022-12-26,"Very good Convenient for early flight, good room and shower would use it again probably - depends on cost. One failing was no usb sockets, couldn’t believe this in a newish modern hotel used by a cross section of people flying. Goid that they did provide a plug adaptor but this needs addressing."
4267,Yaacov,2022-12-26,very easy and simple close to airport easy access nothing
4268,Declan,2022-12-26,excellent staff great food lovely will deffo stay again fantastic location to catch your flight

4274,Pip,2022-12-22,easy access for an early flight availability to airport a bit soulless downstairs
4275,Penny,2022-12-22,Very good Location. Cleanliness. Staff. The fact that you cannot pay with cash at the bar or for your meal at the restaurant.
4276,Steve,2022-12-21,"Very good  Receptionist was rude, a mistake on the booking name make, the receptionist refused to book the guest in, finally she did but said she wouldn’t do it again."
4277,Prentice,2022-12-20,"It was good, great location and easy to get to The room was nice and big as a solo traveler it was good No room service but that could be due to coivd still?"
4278,Lesley,2022-12-20,"already said ‘ideal’. ideal and pleasant. and being told we could have breakfast in the morning between 4am and 6am. booking a family room of 4 including 2 children, 1 age 4 and the other under 1 requiring a cot. the room was exactly the same as my double room. couldn’t walk around once the cot was put in. pram had to go in my room overnight. family rooms need to be larger!!"
4279,Lynn,2022-12-19,Good location for early morning flight
4280,Adrian,2022-12-18,"we liked it so much we nearly didn’t go on vacation clean, busy and friendly. nothing"

4286,Blanca,2022-12-14,"Superb Our flight was cancelled in London and we got a replacement flight very early in the morning from Bristol. The hotel was very convenient: it's in the airport, it is clean and comfortable and the staff is really nice. Breakfast starts at 4am so we could get something to eat before our flight."
4287,Martin,2022-12-13,conviendnt and hassle free when flying early clean and convenient. Early breakfast to cater for early flights
4288,Patricia,2022-12-13,"Superb Comfortable room, but not a good way to order food from the bar. Crowds wanted evening meals and the way you need to order seemed somewhat slow."
4289,Amanda,2022-12-13,"breakfast is good, evening meals not so good. clean and comfortable clean easy access evening meals were poor"
4290,Neil,2022-12-12,Last minute stopover at Bristol Airport Comfortable quiet room with good blackout curtains. Very good breakfast buffet. Convenient walk directly opposite Arrivals exit. Nothing
4291,Martin,2022-12-12,"not the best of hotels or staff, or beer. need some focus by the management team to improve. good location. it was very cold in the main hotel and the bedroom we had just returned from Prague the hotel was much warmer,"

4295,Leung,2022-12-11,good place to spend the night waiting for passengers to arrive proximity to airport & 24/7 food nothing much but could expand 24/7 food slightly please
4296,Rolf,2022-12-11,Staying in this hotel was a lot more relaxing than staying in Bristol. Available breakfast at 04.00 Closeness to Bristol Airport The person who checked us in had to ask for assistance from someone more experienced but it took time
4297,Lynne,2022-12-11,"I chose this hotel because I needed to pick up a rental car the next morning and did not see the point of asking a famil convenient position. After a very late arrival, breakfast finished very early and I was unable to get any."
4298,Robert,2022-12-09,"Hampton Bristol Airport Staff friendly, room clean. Food in restraunt expensive& not varied for cost & more staff needed to clean away tables."

4304,Jordanjones88,2022-12-06,Very good Can't get any closer to the airport. The food was very good. Overpriced at £150.

4316,Tracey,2022-11-29,"Very good Convenient for our early flight at Bristol Airport, all good with staff and accommodation Prices should very Based on duration of stay Prices should be an option on breakfast, as we didn't benefit due to an early flight"
4317,Andrew,2022-11-28,"Bristol The hotel was spotlessly clean,well designed and equipped. The location was perfect for the airport and there was no aircraft noise either. The room was also not too hot ( as many such hotels can be) All in all a perfect place for an airport stop over. Having to pay for parking was not ideal. But it was discounted."
4318,Caroline,2022-11-27,great place to stay pre or post flight very convenient for airport. breakfast starts at 4am so was ideal for an early flight. safe easy parking for the car. plenty of space in room. information about car parking not completely accurate

4320,Maurice,2022-11-27,Very convenient it’s on the airport and open 24/7 Nothing
4321,Shane,2022-11-27,Good right nice to the terminal price
4322,Alan,2022-11-26,"location great - facilities good - price 'reasonable' The location was excellent for my early morning flight. Only second time in Bristol therefore my need to be at the airport early for my flight was the main reason I booked. Will definitively stay again! The price was a little higher than I normally pay, however the location made up for the extra cost"
4323,Anthony,2022-11-26,Excellent but for the mattress Convenience of location. We were able to drop our airline bags off the night before. The mattress in the room was too firm. I woke with backache. I would have appreciated a mattress topper. Perhaps you could tell me if they provide these. As a frequent traveller from Bristol this would me Imwould definitely stay again on numerous occasions during the year
4324,Charles,2022-11-26,"great location - clean, functional for early morning travels location"
4325,John,2022-11-25,"basic, clean functional, excellent location, friendly staff at a reasonable price. very functional with facilities well thought through. nothing to dislike"

4329,Ivor,2022-11-22,Opposite Arrival/Departures Ideal for late flight arrival time. Bed hard.
4330,Christopher,2022-11-21,"I would stay here again. :) Very handy location, clean and modern, good food. All good"
4331,Charlotte,2022-11-21,"Almost perfect! Lovely room and hotel overall. Really comfortable, clean and well-equipped. Bathroom was lovely, shower was hot with good pressure. 4am breakfast was high quality and tasty. The smoke/fire alarm in the room (right above the bed) made an audible high-pitched whine all night, which did disrupt my sleep. Luckily I was only there from 11pm to 4am or I would have said something to reception."
4332,Victoria,2022-11-21,very convenient and comfortable. Staff on check in excellent. staff in morning a little uninterested really convenient for early flight. quiet room and comfy bed food choice very limited and was surprised at how quickly it arrived after ordering (about 3 minutes!!)
4333,Carl,2022-11-20,Very good Great comfortable hotel in short walking distance from airport… Nice staff… And great buffet breakfast… check in was a bit slow… after flight & airport queues… I was exhausted.
4334,Vikki,2022-11-18,"perfect for pre/post flight stay location, comfort, clean, good facilities, nice food, excellent sound proofing no cooked vegetarian options at breakfast no bath"
4335,Ryan,2022-11-18,"Great other than what ive mentioned already, really made my stay sour as it annoyed me quite a lot The stay itself was fine. The fact you have to pay £5 to get out of the car in front of the Hotel or risk a £100 fine is a total joke! The check in staff were agreeing with me on this point and stated that its not under their control, which is fine I accept that! However you as a company/leading brand of hotels should be sticking up for your customers for such things to be removed. Why do you feel its ok for your paying customers to ripped off on your front door? Bristol airport are making a fortune from something completely unfair and people are not given an alternative. money money money that's all its about. Unfair."
4336,Bleddyn,2022-11-18,Superb Great location. Excellent service. lovely and clean rooms Can't really fault the place. Perfect start to our holiday. No mad rush to the airport or stuck on the motorway.
4337,Cc,2022-11-17,"friendly staff, ideal for early morning flight, with breakfast available very clean and relaxed"
4338,Paul,2022-11-17,"Room The staff were great and very helpful and the bed was very comfy, food downstairs was very nice and didn't have to wait long for it to come to you was close to hotel so didn't have to worry about the walk The bathrooms were not very clean there was some unwanted hairs from previous guests that was the only downfall about the hotel the rest of the room was great"
4339,Thomas,2022-11-17,Very good Location Its a little expensive
4340,Gill,2022-11-17,Stay was fine.  bedroom was cold not told till the day we checked out we had to request if we wanted heating on.This should be in the information pack. like wise we were dropped off at the hotel and have twice paid a parking fee but this time discovered yo didn’t have to if you took the ticket to reception.
4341,Johanna,2022-11-17,Friendly efficient hotel. Very comfortable room and bed. Good bathroom and always very clean. Efficient service. Friendly staff. Housekeeping staff particularly good. Breakfast was a little disappointing. I found the food quite oily. The coffee machine is good but the powdered milk completely spoils the taste. Food choice for dinner was limited and until I ordered the curries I found the beef burger and the calamari dishes quite tasteless and the salads were very limited. The tables in the dining area need constant cleaning and the soft furnishings need to be steam cleaned - they are stained and dirty with food. It creates a bad impression altogether.
4342,Kenneth,2022-11-16,"other than above it was really good good efficient and wonderful staff (well the front desk when we got there) no refrigerator in the room (which was rather important, marketing told us there was one?"
4343,Susan,2022-11-16,Superb staff were very helpful bedrooms very spacious and spotless no shuttle to the airport travelling with someone in a wheelchair was not good at all but not the hotels fault!! Chelsea on reception was superb
4344,Kevin,2022-11-16,Convenient Landed after 10pm so was unable to get hire car until the following day. A pleasant overnight stay with breakfast. Nothing.
4345,Susan,2022-11-15,very good shame we had a very early flight the breakfast looked great location nothing
4346,Jill,2022-11-15,Very covenient Room was clean and comfortable. I leftvery early so didn’t have breakfast.
4347,Wright,2022-11-14,very cosy place room just keep going
4348,Peter,2022-11-14,Good It was by the airport If you book for the night you should not have to pay £14 for the parking I think booking .com should have told me
4349,David,2022-11-14,very convenient for airport. comfortable with good facilities. very relaxing. Good in room facilities and breakfast. unable to adjust heating in room 403. (Bristol UK)
4350,Andrea,2022-11-14,"comfy stay to catch up on sleep after late flight. exceptionally clean, very quiet."

4355,Andrew,2022-11-08,Very good  paying for parking
4356,Heidi,2022-11-07,A comfortable overnight stay when I had a flight delay. I’d stay here again. Proximity to Bristol airport terminal. Friendly staff. Room was a little cold on arrival.
4357,Holly,2022-11-07,We will be back :-) This was my first stay at the Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport. I slept much better than I have done at any other hotel or B&B on the way to the airport. It does cost a little more but in my opinion is was definitely worth the extra. The menu in the bar/restaurant area was quite basic. It met our needs but was not very exciting and had limited choices.
4358,Jason,2022-11-07,Good hotel but expensive. Staff very friendly Very expensive
4359,Emma,2022-11-06,"Superb Comfy bed, clean room, wonderful breakfast Evening bartender was very slow and confused"

4363,Rosemarie,2022-11-06,"Would stay again but would not choose to eat or drink at this hotel unless changes are made. Room was good, as were Staff. Breakfast was good Cost of dropping off at Hotel was very bad. Choice and quality of evening meal was appalling"
4364,Paul,2022-11-06,Very good Convenient for the airport. Very clean & modern hotel. I got a good nights sleep in a very comfortable bed. Breakfast was quite disappointing. Rather poor quality bacon and sausage l thought.
4365,Anne,2022-11-05,"brilliant! proximity to airport, clean environment, friendly staff nothing really"
4366,Peter,2022-11-05,"Very good very friendly staff,efficient and well run airport hotel."
4367,Sean,2022-11-05,Superb Food and staff very nice. Food was good but the cooked breakfast needed vegetarian options.
4368,Denise,2022-11-04,Very good The check in lady was lovely and welcoming. The morning staff were very friendly and helpful There were no plug sockets in the room except standard UK which is not great for overseas travellers
4369,Luisa,2022-11-04,wales flight so room convenient for overnight stay. 30% too high comfortable room a bit pricey for Bristol airport
4370,Jennifer,2022-11-04,Good Your telephone message said the price of parking was £8 but we were charged £14.50. Would have liked to park the car for the 4 days but were not offered any options.
4371,Sonia,2022-11-04,"clean, comfortable hotel perfect for pre flight accommodation at Bristol airport clean and comfortable very close to the airport Nothing"
4372,Keith,2022-11-03,"excellent for stay when flying early morning room was good - compact we think - bathroom shower was a bit of a game, managed to get most of the room wet, screen not long enough? Breakfast was excellent for 4am as was the evening meal the night before as above, the room was compact which is ok for overnight but no more"
4373,Richard,2022-11-02,If you've got a 4am start it's worth it. Proximity to the airport for a very early flight. Able to fill a bag with pastries to take to the terminal Takeaway breakfast options were very limited. Price of a pint at the bar was extortionate.
4374,Simon,2022-11-02,"Convenient and a good hotel. Stayed over the night before my trip. Convenient hotel and can walk to the airport terminal. Clean, modern and spacious room. Friendly staff. Price a little expensive for a Monday night. Overall, satisfied. Booking parking with hotel could be simplified."
4375,Ken,2022-11-02,Superb very comfortable clean and great location A bit expensive At breakfast chef wouldn’t provide fried eggs which was disappointing
4376,Samantha,2022-11-01,Very good Really convenient for a late night arrival at the airport. Clean and comfortable room with a decent breakfast which is all I really needed.
4377,David,2022-11-01,Superb Location - so handy for a morning flight A bit pricey
4378,Giada,2022-11-01,"Very good Very convenient for early flights. Room was clean & comfortable. Staff was very helpful. Quite expensive. It does make early flights a lot easier, but it's hard to justify the cost on top of flight tickets, so we don't book here very often."
4379,Lynn,2022-10-29,so easy to walk out of airport to the hotel. great location. price.
4380,Carol,2022-10-29,Well located and quiet hotel Fantastic location and wonderful breakfast. Quiet. Nothing
4381,Lynette,2022-10-28,Good Location was excellent for early morning departure.3 min walk from terminal to hotel Couldn't get a grab and go breakfast as delivery not been made. Think the price is a little expensive
4382,Victoria,2022-10-28,"Very good Proximity to the Airport- perfect for late arrivals, early departures- you can walk. Dinner menu could be improved."
4383,Sally-anne,2022-10-28,good! great location quite expensive
4384,Scott,2022-10-27,"Airport overnighter Check in, bedroom and buffet cooked or continental breakfast we've all excellent Staff we've very friendly and attentive Lunch was very disappointing. No hot food. Soup that was clearly out of a tin. Totally bland dry sandwich."
4385,Janet,2022-10-27,"Helpful staff, clean comfortable room, taxi available to airport dropoff. Food was available. Staff and room very good. Food available late and breakfast available from 4am. Situated within airport grounds. Short walk with plenty of steep steps, or ramps taking far longer, to walk to airport. No problem if fit and able and not pouring with rain! Arrow taxi rank at airport able to oblige with pickup from hotel and dropoff at airport for under 20 pounds. Worked, but you need to plan in advance especially if heavy rain as I had."
4386,Miranda,2022-10-27,would return clean and convenient very expensive food and drinks
4387,M,2022-10-26,"Hotel was great but access to Airport was not easy. The Hotel was very good. With two medium sized suitcases, we found the walk to and from the airport difficult and tiring. This was never explained before we booked the hotel and was not expected. We are reasonably fit and not disabled but neither are we Olympic athletes!!!"
4388,Trudi,2022-10-25,"perfect for an early flight the next day new, clean and convenient nothing"
4389,Claire,2022-10-25,"Good but not great value for money. Staff at check in (very late!) were extremely helpful. Excellent HOT buffet Breakfast. Rates are very expensive, even for an airport hotel!"
4390,Suzanne,2022-10-24,"perfect for late arrivals or early departures ideal location for Bristol Airport, excellent reception staff, comfortable bed and decent sized room."
4391,Edward,2022-10-24,Not perfect but pretty good Room too small on one side of bed for 2. Television had no signal. Bathroom sliding door did not fully close. Lack of space on one side of bed for the other person when they got out.
4392,Alex,2022-10-23,Very pleasant Excellent location right next to the airport.
4393,Peter,2022-10-23,"Good  In a word, the food we ordered for dinner was absolutely hopeless. It was presented well but well, - tasteless and was not beef but something's pretending to be a hamburger. Terrible!"
4394,Veronica,2022-10-22,too short a stay to make further comments. but comfortable for what we needed perfectly located as we had a very early flight
4395,Matthew,2022-10-21,"Perfect pre-trip stay I've only ever seen this hotel from the outside and thought it would be the usual souless place you would expect to find at an airport. I couldn't have been more wrong. Great atmosphere, friendly and welcoming employees, decent size room and simply the best bed I've ever slept in (I want one!) Bar prices a little on the steep side."
4396,Hugh,2022-10-20,Convenient and efficient hotel for Beistol airport. Good breakfast too. Location and convenience
4397,Lynne,2022-10-19,Convient The room was comfortable. The food offering was poor in view of the price paid. Not even a proper restaurant. It is about transit passengers but the public areas are poor and not relaxing.
4398,Peter,2022-10-18,Superb Room was spotless. No complaints. Car parking expensive.
4399,Emma,2022-10-18,Expensive but comfortable stay in ideal location. location location location. you can’t ask for nearer if you have an early flight and amazingly convenient to do bag drop night before. price. it is expensive for what it is (chain hotel albeit reasonable standard) but fundamentally you are paying for location. Food in cafe (order at counter) is ok but generic.
4400,Jonathan,2022-10-18,"Very good very good staff rooms and location no fridges in rooms, when travelling with a newborn was inconvenient as couldn’t bring new borns milk. was offered shared fridge but obviously not happy leaving milk in there."
4401,Paul,2022-10-18,comfortable hotel which is so close to the airport that it is amazing for early morning flights. close to airport and very clean with friendly helpful staff. comfortable beds and quiet air con that was easily controlled helped get a good nights sleep before a very early flight. very early breakfast (available from 4am!!) was a bonus too. Evening dining facilities were limited in choice but slightly better than airport landslide facilities.
4402,Angela,2022-10-18,nearest to airport tick all the boxes near to airport
4403,Mike,2022-10-17,"Ok, location Breakfast. Ok Evening meal poor"
4404,Alison,2022-10-16,Very convenient and comfortable but the lack of breakfast items available was disappointing. very convenient for airport There was not much left of the hot breakfast when we got there at about 9am and only hot chocolate available in coffee machine.

4409,Robert,2022-10-15,"Expensive, but OK The hotel was a 2 min walk from airport arrivals , which had lights all the way. The room was clean' The night staff were friendly' Don't think it was worth £164 a night. No shower cap or toothpaste in the room, I think at £164 a night, would have been nice."
4410,Nicholas,2022-10-15,very expensive but close to the terminal location is great for an early flight costs ridiculous amount of money and even short parking for drop off is expensive
4411,Ian,2022-10-14,convenient for Bristol airport convenient for Bristol airport. Clean and comfortable Breakfast could have been better. there were no croissants out and no plain yoghurt.
4412,Edwin,2022-10-13,Over priced Early in the morning ok The price

4419,Goody,2022-10-11,Superb Everything Having to pay for breakfast when we couldn't have a hot on as the flight was too early
4420,Kath,2022-10-11,"Comfortable stay. Shame about the food  The food was dreadful. Fast food, precooked and then microwaved, not what you expect from the Hilton brand. Continental breakfast was awful. No butter except for a tub of marks and spencer butter, pre-used with toast crumbs in it. No brown bread for toast and no milk. Nobody around to speak to at 4a.m. Receptionists busy with customers checking out"
4421,Ann,2022-10-11,"Superb Directly on the Airport , bathroom well equipped for our overnight stay, good selection of meals, reasonably priced and the included breakfast adequate . Pillows too soft, very uncomfortable, no matter how many I used they just sank to nothing, have stayed here before but they weren't like that then"
4422,M,2022-10-11,"Good Hotel but access to Airport is poor. The Hotel was excellent overall. With two average sized suitcases, the walk to the airport is hard work either up numerous steps or along several zigzag ramps. We were very lucky it was not raining/icy."
4423,Linda,2022-10-11,Very good Easy walking distance to airport.very conveniant
4424,Claire,2022-10-11,"Very good Close proximity to airport, was great for an early flight. Really friendly staff, especially in the restaurant. Liked that there was a breakfast pack to take away as flight was too early for breakfast in the hotel. Was very useful. Price was quite expensive, presumably because of proximity to airport. Not much choice of food at restaurant."
4425,Beatriz,2022-10-10,Very good Really comfortable bed and lovely room I received a wake up call at 5:30am by mistake as I did not request that. It didn't ruin my stay but I much rather not having received it.
4426,Roger,2022-10-09,oK. bit be warned very limited evening meal availability. Jose again? Yes but reluctantly. clean and tidy. comfortable bed and bathroom outrageous to charge for car parking for guest staying the night!

4430,Linda,2022-10-09,Very good Never had breakfast left to early could have if I wanted it .the evening meal was rubbish and needs to be looked at.
4431,Helen,2022-10-09,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
4432,Kevin,2022-10-08,Good overall and convenient let down by the canteen style restaurant good location for airport Restaurant food poor standard for a Hilton Hotel. Bar service queuing lane impersonal and spoilt the experience.
4433,Marion,2022-10-08,Great location Wonderful staff. Comfortable lounges to relax in. Great location for airport access. Room a little small esp given that the sofa had unnecessarily been set up as a bed. There were only 2 of is in Room 348.
4434,Hazel,2022-10-08,"Convenient hotel when you have a late or early flight. Very close to airport terminal Very quiet room Comfortable bed Reception told us breakfast was from 4am - 11am We arrived for breakfast at 10.10….to be told by quite a grumpy employee breakfast finished at 10am. He reluctantly interrupted a business meeting in the breakfast area and then agreed we could have breakfast. Not great as we’d paid £165 for the night. We didn’t have toast, fruit etc as felt a bit awkward interrupting the morning briefing. The grumpy employee might have offered to help get the extra things we needed for a full breakfast."
4435,Davina,2022-10-07,Overnight stay chosen for convenience Good food For the price and knowing people turn up at all times often travel weary there could be a bottle of water in the room
4436,Colin,2022-10-07,"See above The size and comfort of the bedrooms, the location and breakfast were very good. The evening dinner was terrible with little choice. The ""Special"" which was a curry was like slop a complete waste of money.For a hotel of that size and expensive (£155) for one night it should do a lot better"

4444,Mrs,2022-10-05,"Convenient airport location Location and cleanliness absolutely faultless. The staff were very friendly and efficent and plenty of choice at breakfast even for a 4am breakfast. Very poor night of sleep given the price we paid, the bed was very uncomfortable which did not make a good start to our holiday. Think the beds have been changed since our last stay?"
4445,Sarah,2022-10-05,Essential and limited on time it was very close to the airport. The price for an emergency stay for one night.
4446,Harlow,2022-10-05,"Superb Close to airport, very clean staff very helpfull Could be cheaper"

4454,Bobbie,2022-10-04,"SURPRISINGLY BEST HAMPTON BY HILTON Normally Hampton's are basic and sometimes slightly depressing ""liverpool airport Speke Hampton Hotel comes to mind"" but this is not! Staff were brilliant from my 2:30 am check-in, my everything is included breakfast and to finally check-out. Great help, good breakfast & great service, to be honest best customer service ive received in a hotel for over 2 years and THATS alot of hotels. Well Done to your staff and you are definitely the bonus to a slightly unimpressive Bristol Airport."
4455,Heatley,2022-10-03,Very good Room clean comfortable excellent location to terminal. Food choice and quality not bad. Staff were friendly Little bit over priced you get caned for last minute booking .
4456,Sara,2022-10-03,"very happy will stay at this hotel again in the near future. Good breakfast, very close to the airport. Our room was good size, warm, and very clean. Better view maybe"

4459,Nicholas,2022-10-03,Perfectly fine. Convenient location Breakfast was too compicated when in a rush.
4460,Melanie,2022-10-03,"Really great stay, evening menu lacking choice. The convenience to the airport. The friendly staff, particularly at reception. Incredibly comfortable beds. Lovely temperature in bedroom. Clean and tidy rooms. The poor chouce of food for our evening meal, very basic and special menu stated peas but they were mushy peas....yuk!"
4461,Louise,2022-10-03,"Did the job though not a enjoyable and relaxing start to holiday, thought it was expensive. Convenient and geared up for flights, efficient and friendly check in. quiet, good beds, good sleep. Breakfast from 4 am ! Super close walk to terminal, though wouldn’t be ok if you had mobility problems as included 2 flights of steps. Good that taxis get a free pass out otherwise they won’t accept pick up . We were sorely disappointed by the poor quality, limited choice and poor value of evening meal . The ‘Special’ was a dried up cheap pie, brown smash and a few mushy peas - only the gravy made it edible. I thought even the staff were embarrassed. The dining room area was grubby and tired (seats stained and bits of coleslaw / food o do had to watch where you sat).Badly arranged canteen style with little ambiance or coziness and was a continuation of reception and the thoroughfare to the airport. Breakfast was really good but chaotic, only one coffee machine switched on , run out of teabags, food stations and crockery/ cutlery not topped up - so took ages to find things you wanted . Room was good except for trim missing on bathroom door and grubby and shredded shower tray non slip section . Not what I expected from a good brand and premium price."
4462,David,2022-10-03,adequate position limited dinner menu

4465,Philip,2022-10-02,Good The location is perfect The dinner menu was limited
4466,The,2022-10-02,"Good Great buffet breakfast, friendly staff, and only a very short walk from airport entrance. We arrived near midnight with our little kid and they had forgotten to make up the sofa bed so we had to wait for them to come with bedding which was not great with a very tired and crying child."
4467,Ruth,2022-10-02,Very good Convenient. Polite helpful staff. Greek salad. Hummus was good

4471,Casey,2022-10-01,"Convenient and friendly We stayed here due to having a flight from the airport the next day - it was very practical.

4476,Amanda,2022-09-28,Perfect spot if on a late arrival or early departure for Bristol Breakfast was excellent great choice and very good. No bath.. only had a shower.. and could have done with a bed throw as I was a bit cold in bed
4477,Claire,2022-09-27,Excellent value for money Breakfast
4478,Hans,2022-09-27,my very short stay fulfilled the purpose... excellent - nothing I didn´t like nothing
4479,Alexander,2022-09-26,"THE LOCATION WAS BRILLIANT BUT AT A HIGH PRICE. WE CHOSE THE HOTEL PURELY FOR THE LOCATION AND THAT IT WAS A GOOD HOTEL CHAIN. THE STAFF WERE EXTREMELY FRIENDLY AND PROFESSIONAL. FOR ONE NIGHT'S STAY £240 FOR ONE NIGHT WAS A LOT OF MONEY AND OVERALL DID NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THAT COST. THE ROOM FACILITIES WERE GOOD BUT HAD A BASIC LOOK/FEEL..........CONSIDERING THE COST OF THE ROOM. WE HAD A MEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MINE BACK AS IT HAD NOT BEEN MICROWAVED THOROUGHLY. THE CENTRE WAS COLD AND THE REST TEPID. THE STAFF WERE QUICK TO SORT THIS OUT AND THE REPLACEMENT MEAL WAS PIPING HOT. HOWEVER, THE MEAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN PIPING HOT TO BEGIN WITH! ONCE AGAIN, FOOD AND DRINK HIGHLY PRICED BUT NOT AT A STANDARD THAT GOES WITH £240 PER NIGHT."

4484,John,2022-09-25,Very good airport
4485,Margaret,2022-09-25,Good Proximity to airport Food very average compared to Birmingham airport hotel
4486,Finola,2022-09-24,"Convenient for airport (250 yard walk), clean and comfortable, but all of the above. Very close to airport and room clean and comfortable. Check in staff cheerful and friendly. Menu could be improved, along with the service at the bar (One person who blamed staff shortages - not my problem) We booked a room with breakfast, but had a very early departure so we were given a breakfast bag - a banana, a chocolate cereal bar and something else which I threw away - very poor, not even a hot drink. All in all, OK for convenience but very expensive (£157) for what we actually got."
4487,Ruth,2022-09-24,Excellant and a perfect start to out UK trip Hot Breakfast was very good and with a wide variety of items We are very pleased with Bristol and the close location of the Hotel. The room more than met our expectations I found it difficult to find the right sized plated and surprised there was no Hot plates for the Hot breakfast. I would have liked some Grenola or equivalent for breakfast

Easy access when driving to hotel. Loved the breakfast bags that were supplied for my early departure. Lack of choice of food on Menu think it could be a little more varied."

4494,Colin,2022-09-22,"Perfect for an early morning flight. Was super clean and modern. Right next to the terminal, but no issue with noise. The bed was firm and the shower excellent. The room is a little on the small side, but ok for one night."

4496,Sally,2022-09-20,Good It's a comfortable and safe hotel for solo travellers. The price! The room was much more expensive than in February. The croissants at breakfast could have been fresher.
4497,Jackie,2022-09-20,Lovely stay although quite expensive for time we were there. We were very early leaving and able to take a bagged breakfast! Excellent! Somewhere for children to sit and play quietly . There lots of games and drawing available but children had to sit at tables next to adult strangers. We were two families with 4 extremely well behaved children - It would have been nice to have a small area separate though!

4514,Rebecca,2022-09-15,"Very good Location was good, food was good. Real beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was very good. Evening meal was nice. Reception safe very helpful. Ideal to walk to the airport. 3 people in room meant the 3rd person was on a sofa bed so limited space to move and the sofa bed was not very comfortable. We paid for 3 people in the room and there were 3 beds made up but there were not 3 towels, not 3 cups and not 3 glasses?"

4518,John,2022-09-15,Excellent for early morning travellers if a little on the expensive Side. Only needed a couple of Rooms for short time due to early morning flight and hotel suited this purpose excellently. Short walk to Airport Terminal. Staff very attentive and friendly. Continental Breakfast available for early starters. We had an issue with checking in. I had booked two rooms and they had difficulty with finding one of the rooms details. However this was sorted quite quickly. Little on the expensive side for the time we were there.
4519,Madeleine,2022-09-15,"Good, but too expensive! Room was excellent - everything great. Location great - short walk to Terminal - ideal place to stay for an early morning flight. Breakfast - coffee from machines not very good. Croissant doughy and not cooked through. Cooked choices were not appetising. Yoghourt was deiicious though!"

4527,Lorna,2022-09-13,Very enjoyable and comfortable The room was very comfortable as was the bed. All Linen and towels were clean. We were surprised also how quiet the hotel was considering its proximity to the airport. The ease of booking in to the airport for our flight Just a small complaint about the breakfast. The sausages were overcooked and the skins were very tough to cut through. Also the scrambled eggs were dry. Otherwise everything else was okay.
4528,Alison,2022-09-13,"It was easy to book, expensive for one night but comfortable stay close to the airport very expensive. not many staff on when checking in so took a while (30mins wait) we didn’t eat as the reviews were not very good."
4529,Linda,2022-09-13,"It was comfortable but t would have liked a warm, comfortable and friendly bar or coffee area It was very close to the airport. It was too expensive and the decor and facilities did not warrant the high prices. I would have expected a much higher standard for that price range."
4530,Karen,2022-09-12,"Great location, nice clean room. Wish we had known about the food available Room. Tea and coffee in room. Shower. We were advised that there was no restaurant . The website also makes no reference to food available. We ate an M&S sandwich in our room but the bar food available would have been perfectly adequate."

4535,Denise,2022-09-12,"Good hotel, excellent location and very quiet so managed to sleep well. The hotel was very conveniently situated being on the airport site. I was not able to have breakfast at the hotel as my flight was too early for the breakfast service but a take away breakfast bag was supplied instead. My hotel room was very quiet and I did not have any disturbance from the airport. I cannot think of anything that could be better."
4536,Beverley,2022-09-12,Superb LOVELY STAFF Bed was super comfy and hotel really clean Not enough choice for vegetarian food. I arrived late and all that was available was cheese sandwich. The soya milk seemed to be a problem for the staff but they got round it. At the morning buffet the potato cakes were hard and dried out. The vegetarian sausages were of very poor quality and tasted horrible. I think you need to increase awareness of available vegan and vegetarian options for cooked breakfast.
4537,Jane,2022-09-11,Very good  We didnt find the beds that comfortable. The evening menu is very limited

Expensive howe Location, facilities and staff Booking.com advertised a property credit of £20 included in the £185 rate and as we intended to dine, thought this was worth the extra. The hotel staff were unaware of this offer/arrangement which was awkward and embarrassing, although they were charming enough to honour it. Please sort this out between the hotel and Booking.com as it should not be advertised unless agreed and known by staff."
4586,Mohamed,2022-08-26,it was very short but comfortable walking distance from the airport breakfast can be improved
4587,Ann,2022-08-25,Very good Breakfast Toe nail clippings on carpet at side of bed. Cleaners need to clean properly.

4593,Sotiria,2022-08-23,"Good Excellent location, 5 min on foot from the airport. Ideal for an overnight stay. The room was a good size and the bathroom was spacious. I explicitly requested a packed breakfast as we had an early flight. Even though I was promised that would be the case, there was no packed breakfast available at 06:00 and we had to quickly grub a couple of items from the breakfast buffet on our way to the airport."
4594,Rhianydd,2022-08-22,From the airport to bed in under 10 minutes! The location is perfect for the airport Breakfast is good with plenty of choice and extended times. Staff are friendly The food on offer in the evening is basic. We'd eat before arrival next time. No room service Rooms are basic but fine for the purpose of our stay

4601,Joanne,2022-08-20,"Staff great position great bed’s poor  The mattress was very hard and because of this didn’t sleep very well it was a shame because everything else was very good, but you do expect a good sleep this needs to be addressed."

4603,Margaret,2022-08-18,"Comfortable, nice hotel, very convenient. Location was excellent for an early flight At 1.30am in the morning the emergency alarm was going. This was apparently a ""false"" alarm. Everyone had started to evacuate when we were told this. There was no apology or explanation. This meant disrupted sleep particularly for families in nearby rooms."
4604,Anthony,2022-08-17,Very good Location Food not of the standard one would expect from a Hilton Hotel
4605,Jacqueline,2022-08-16,"Very good we will stay again Friendly staff, clean and quiet hotel nice breakfast"

4607,Valerie,2022-08-15,Good airport hotel though quite expensive  some of the staff did not seem very well informed e.g. one told me that I could not order at the bar and charge to the room.
4608,Rebecca,2022-08-14,"Good for ease of access to the airport for an early morning flight. Location, ease of access to the airport, clean and modern hotel The queen sofa beds aren’t comfortable. The food in the restaurant at dinner time was poor. The digital key on the app didn’t initially work and I was told to go to the checkin despite checking in in advance which defies the point of the early checkin."
4609,John,2022-08-14,"ok, but if it wasn’t for the location the hotel wouldn’t have an awful lot going for it. but if you want the airport the location No room service"

4613,Kathy,2022-08-11,"very convenient location, easy access , open round the clock. Will use again. Walking distance to airport. Reception open 24 hours. Take away breakfast available if leaving early. Clean, spacious family room with big sofa bed and a queen bed. Staying one night to drop son off at airport early in the morning. Had to pay 15 pounds car park fee for the night. Thought it could have been complimentary as staying in hotel."
4614,Andrew,2022-08-11,As expected Both excellent All good
4615,Lauren,2022-08-10,"Exceeded expectations I wasn't expecting much from this hotel when booking. Booked for convenience as it was closest to the airport, however it exceeded my expectations. Loved the rooms, the decor and ambiance. Staff were friendly and helpful. All facilities were up to a good standard. Good choice especially for breakfast! We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend. The toilets in reception were not clean and there were crumbs and dirt in reception waiting area that let the rest of it down."
4616,Erica,2022-08-09,Superb convenient to airport fir late arrival and fir pick up of hire vehicle. my room was at the end of a corridor so very quiet.
4617,Leony,2022-08-09,Convenient but a little expensive especially when having y to o pay h fi or parking on top  Having to pay to park at the hotel! I know we had an early flight so left at 3am but I think they could offer more than they do for breakfast at that time for the price or give the option of not paying for breakfast.
4618,George,2022-08-09,"Very good Very close both to the airport terminal and to the multi storey car park 24 hour check in, which was quick, efficient and friendly"

4620,Jacqueline,2022-08-09,"Short but brief, did job perfectly. Brilliant location for Bristol airport for an early flight. Really comfortable beds and clean bathroom. Continental breakfast wasn’t great. No croissants left at 5.30am. Just all looked a bit lacking to be honest."
4621,Colin,2022-08-09,Very good location for airport. Comfortable rooms Menu for evening meal was poor

4625,Lucie,2022-08-08,Comfortable and good location for the airport Comfy beds and good selection at breakfast Food at dinner could be improved - wasn’t quite the standard expected for the price paid
4626,David,2022-08-07,"It's a budget hotel in a unique location. The hotel prices itself accordingly. Location Hot breakfast doesn't start until 7:00 People stay here to meet early flights, hot food earlier would have been appreciated"
4627,Philippe,2022-08-06,useful Useful for a night near the airport. No taxi needed
4628,Alison,2022-08-06,"Superb Great staff. So handy for the airport. Great aircon (I was there in the heatwave). It was a bit pricey, but airport hotels often are."
4629,Barry,2022-08-06,"Disappointing compared to previous stays We have stayed here quite a few times when having an early flight or late arrival. In terms of proximity to the airport and pure convenience, it just can't be beaten. Compared to previous stays, this was disappointing. The hotel remains unchanged in terms of cleanliness, professional staff and convenience etc., but the price we paid was considerably higher than before - I would say double the price, if not more. My past reviews were, of course based on a lower price, and therefore better value. The food served also seemed to be of lower quality - same menu, similar price, but just not as good. We have decided, despite the obvious convenience, not to repeat our stay at current pricing levels."
4630,Kate,2022-08-05,"Very good Short walk from the airport, lovely staff, v comfy bed and good breakfast. There's also a huge space for hanging out before you need to go to the airport, with departure boards. Much more comfortable than the airport itself."
4631,Emmanuel,2022-08-05,"All perfect...but the ""restaurant""!! Super fast check in, I was done in 2mn. The room was perfect, spacious, clean, comfortable bed, everything there. Short walk to the terminal. Staff very professional. The restaurant is not really a restaurant. I order indian food, it arrived within 5mn, tasted rather like a cheap ready meal (I really believe it was a ready meal, it was definitely NOT proper food cooked from scratch), awful. And you can only pay by card, they do not accept cash. I wish I got a Subway from the terminal instead."
4632,Sarah,2022-08-05,"good location convenient, comfortable bed computer was down so check in was very long"
4633,Trish,2022-08-05,"Very good The proximity to Bristol airport very comfortable, breakfast was good. The air conditioning made the dinning, reception areas feel very cold, we had to go back to our rooms because it was so chilly."

4641,John,2022-07-31,Adequate for transit to Bristol Airport. Very good. Staff Very helpful. All okay
4642,Jacqueline,2022-07-31,"Excellent place to start our family holiday. Location was excellent for our early morning flight. Rooms had everything we needed The price of room included breakfast but because we had to leave at 4pm for our flight, we didn’t have time to eat it. We weren’t offered a choice for it not to be included."
4643,Hannah,2022-07-31,Good and convenient Helpful packed breakfast for an early flight It’s quite expensive but not surprisingly so given how convenient it is for early flights
4644,Karen,2022-07-31,Superb Standards of cleanliness are top notch. Food quality of evening meal was not tasty(fish and chips) chips were lukewarm.
4645,Charles,2022-07-30,"As an airport hotel it was a good choice being close to the terminal and met our requirements. We picked this airport hotel due to a leg injury I sustained whilst on holiday. I booked Special Assistance with the airline and the hotel staff were very helpful in arranging for the transfer bus to the terminal. Room was well furnished. Bathroom with large walk-in shower was a plus. The twin-room could have been a little larger as it was very difficult to use the chair at the work desk - too tight to the bed. Basic English breakfast, adequate but nothing exceptional."

People working there are helpful and kind. Restaurant is also very efficient and good quality. So a short stay become a good relaxing moment Price is slightly higher than expected, even evaluating position and great service."
4652,Deirdre,2022-07-28,Very good We only stayed overnight.We had a problem that the receptionist had no record of the Booking.com reservation but fortunately found us a room on the ground floor which was helpful.
4653,Marilyn,2022-07-28,"Ideal stay for Airport Clean,comfortable room. Use of computer/printer in reception area. Very close proximity to the Airport. Not a great deal of choice in the restaurant. Also,quite chilly in that area because of the air-conditioning."

4679,Alan,2022-07-15,Very good  We left at 5am but had no time for breakfast. There is a 'grab and go' up to 5 am I suggest that this is extended to say 8am to give all the opportunity to eat.
4680,Ann,2022-07-15,"Very good Location at Bristol airport was excellent. Breakfast was ok although no fried eggs, I learnt sometime ago not to eat the scrabble eggs. It would have made a big difference."

4695,Stephen,2022-07-07,"Excellent location, extremely comfortable and amazing staff. The staff were all very helpful but some were new and did not know the system. The room was perfect for my mother and I. It did not mention that there was a kettle in the room which was an added bonus. My Aunt and Uncle drove us to the hotel which was quite a distance for them. It was so nice that we were able to offer them tea in the restaurant and not have to pay a parking fee as the car parking ticket was validated by the reception staff. I was also able to push the wheeelchair for my Mother from the room to the airport check in without too much effort."
4696,Gideon,2022-07-06,"very nice convenient stay Very good location next to the airport, perfect for my morning flight. Very nice size room with comfortable bed and excellent breakfast."
4697,Blackstar,2022-07-06,"Comfortable and welcoming. Late, very late check in thanks to a very delayed flight was no bother. Check in staff were very welcoming indeed. Bed very comfy, quiet, welcome night sleep. Breakfast staff were very helpful and happy. Made to feel really welcome. The prices have been creeping up somewhat. Looking at future prices, I think we may need to look elsewhere which is a shame because this has always been a good value hotel."
4698,Clare,2022-07-06,"Lovely, clean hotel Really comfortable and clean. Breakfast started at 4am and it was brilliant..lots of choice. Was given choice of floor too and staff were lovely. It was quite expensive for one night stay but I was willing to pay this for the convenience if being so close to airport in morning."
4699,Rebecca,2022-07-06,"Nice hotel, dinner in restaurant poor Lovely fresh rooms, nice and big, easy to control temperature, black out curtains excellent. Breakfast setup great for early flights Quick walk to airport Food was terrible. Ordered a jacket potato with beans for my daughter, the beans were stone cold with some scrambled egg in them??? Couldn't help but think they were left over from breakfast. Gross. I ordered a burger and chips and neither were even warm! We sent both meals back (after having to flag restaurant staff down they were no where to been seen during the meal) but both came back barely warm again. Couldn't be bothered with the faff of having to find someone again as we were starving from travelling. No one came to check or say sorry it was really poor for the price of the food and the price of the rooms!"
4700,Nicholas,2022-07-06,"Very good Get staff, location, breakfast, cleanliness etc. We wanted family room (2 adult 2 kids) but all that was available was double with sofa bed pullout. The pullout sofa in the room had a hard metal mechanism poking out which our young daughter hurt herself on while getting out of the bed."
4701,Cherry,2022-07-05,Superb Such a convenient location to the airport- great. Check in was speedy and the receptionist was helpful and informative. Beds were comfortable and we slept well Surprised that breakfast ended so abruptly and also so soon after fresh hot food had been put out

4705,Wayne,2022-07-04,"Enjoyable nights stay that took the stress out of travelling and flying on the same day Location takes the stress out of travelling to the airport same day to fly. Friendly staff, clean room, great shower and comfortable bed. Food and drink was reasonably priced given the location Was not made aware at check in that a breakfast bag was available for early departures. This would have been good to know as breakfast proper is not available until 4am."
4706,Christian,2022-07-04,OK  Ok
4707,Maria,2022-07-03,"It was good. Efficient. Comfortable. Comfortable bed. Nice shower. Clean room. Breakfast available since very early morning. Efficient service at reception and restaurant. Convenient location. Room size just about right - I would have liked it a bit bigger given the room price. Hair dryer missing. Restaurant menu is ok but some little improvements could help. Service at the restaurant very minimal - no table cloth, cheap silvery, table not quite clean."
4708,Katrina,2022-07-03,"Good option if you have an early flight Excellent location. Comfortable room. Friendly staff. Nothing in the short time we were there, we arrived late and left very early & only spent time in our room."

4725,Janet,2022-06-26,"All the staff were cheerful and extremely helpfully I had ordered special assistance with Ryanair and the hotel told me that there was no problem with this. However at 4am they were not able to contact Ryanair - no one was answering the phone.After more than half an hour of trying, one of the receptionists said that she would go up to the airport with me and carry my luggage. I was very grateful and thought that this was above and beyond the call of duty. I would have liked waitress service in the restaurant. As I have a back problem I found standing in a queue waiting to order very difficult."

Good to have breakfast and a restaurant available. Buffer breakfast could be improved, breads with cold meats would be better, one coffee machine and hot water not working."
4729,Lynne,2022-06-25,"Great location and nicely furnished. Great to have the hotel just a short walk from the airport, when we didn't land until 1:30 in the morning!"
4730,Shirley,2022-06-24,Good. Made our flight out to Majorca so much easier after a good nights sleep and breakfast readily available to help ourselves. Room clean and comfortable..
4731,Gareth,2022-06-24,great location but price is going up significantly every year. service is really poor but the location is unbeatable for location service
4732,Irene,2022-06-24,Superb Comfortable hotel Ideal location for the airport.
4733,Iain,2022-06-24,"Great for travelers - but expensive excellent facilities, good breakfast, great location Aircon not working in room"

4740,Colin,2022-06-20,Good Location Thought the restaurant menu was very poor
4741,Brenda,2022-06-20,As above Hampton just short walk to airport No breakfast had to beat airport by 4am No complaints all as expected
4742,Natalia,2022-06-20,Superb was very short walking distance to the airport. Was quiet so could have a good night rest before the early morning flight.
4743,Kate,2022-06-20,"We enjoyed our stay and being able to check our luggage in with Jet2 the night before made things so much less stressful proximity to the airport. Takeaway breakfast was very poor. Two cartons of juice, an apple and a packet of biscuits!"
4744,Daniel,2022-06-19,Very good  Room service
4745,Elizabeth,2022-06-19,"Very good welcoming poor external signage from the Airport. Poor lighting to the hotel once one had left the immediate Airport area, as a woman I would have been very wary if I had been on my own. Some breakfast foods not available."
4746,Colin,2022-06-18,Superb Conveniently located on the airport. Room comfortable.
4747,Fee,2022-06-17,"Stay was very comfortable. The location was excellent and so surprised we couldn’t hear any noise from airplanes. Excellent breakfast. Your front of house male on the checking in desk was very pleasant and helpful. We did go to get some drinks and a female serving was a little bit brusk and not extremely helpful, plus I couldn’t get a coffee as she said the machine was broken. She seemed a little bit impatient."
4748,Isabelle,2022-06-16,Very good Walking distance to airport Breakfast was not cooked properly
4749,Laraine,2022-06-15,great for airport travel. at the airport so great for tired travelers. breakfast was very basic.
4750,Collette,2022-06-14,comfortable and great location easy access to airport for early morning flight restaurant service could be better
4751,Linda,2022-06-14,stay overnight for early flight great location for airport
4752,Angie,2022-06-14,"Great for an early morning flight Right next door to the airport, had an early morning flight so missed breakfast but they did a take away breakfast of a croissant, juice and an orange. Friendly staff, restaurant food is quick and easy ie pizza, burgers, pasta dishes"
4753,Kelly,2022-06-14,"Ideal location Great location Only a takeaway breakfast bag as I had an early flight, but the booking is bed and breakfast"
4754,Linda,2022-06-14,"we would definitely stay there again. Ideal location convenient location, clean, bedrooms quiet. queues for drinks and food. insufficient staff"
4755,Sue,2022-06-13,Very good Didn’t have breakfast Thought it was expensive
4756,Sharon,2022-06-13,"Superb Location, comfortable and clean. Good breakfast Everything was ok"
4757,Goddard,2022-06-13,Will use again The location in relation to the departures at the airport
4758,Leigh-anne,2022-06-13,overpriced but convenient stop over for early morning flights. proximity to airport is main reason to use this hotel as the room price has become very expensive. Staff are pleasant. Nothing much not to like except perhaps there was a lack of anything easy to grab like a banana at 4am for an early morning flight and no bags obvious to take a pastry in. I didn't have time to search for a staff member to ask. I would only use this hotel when flight departure is 8 am or earlier as it has become quite expensive. There are many other options within a 10 minute drive some offering airport transfers.
4759,Alyson,2022-06-12,"Very convenient for flights and a good quality room The room was very well appointed, attractive and spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable and the room was well sound-proofed. staff at reception and in the bar/restaurant were all very friendly and helpful. The restaurant meal wasn’t great quality and the advertised ’grab and go’ breakfast for early starters turned out to mean ‘make your own breakfast and put it in one of these bags - except that we’ve run out of bags.’ We ended up just grabbing a croissant, which turned out to be stale."
4760,Edwina,2022-06-12,It’s was ok and convenient  Juice provided that had to be thrown away at check in
4761,Tim,2022-06-12,Very good stay after a flight Location is just outside arrivals/departures.Food available at all times and the breakfast is particularly good.Very clean and comfortable place to stay Nothing to dislike
4762,Christopher,2022-06-12,"very pleasant stay before flying rooms were spacious, very clean. the rooms a were very quite . walking distance to the airport.ordered evening food which was very good . that the high price did not include a takeaway breakfast which was in with the prices. we had a early start. that we had to pay parking at this hotel which was next door to the hotel."
4763,Verenna,2022-06-11,"Ok, convenient but expensive clean, nice shower, lovely staff. Not a great mattress and duvet too small for a queen size bed! why do hotels use too small duvets? curtains could do with a hoover! very dusty. Food was adequate but not great."
4764,Keith,2022-06-11,Excellent location and a very well maintained hotel with polite and friendly staff Great location for airport. There were several items on the menu not available.
4765,Joy,2022-06-10,ok location reception staff so very slow at check in - late at night and just took ages with the computer and paperwork.
4766,Lynda,2022-06-09,Convenient location but what happened to my pajamas?? Convenient I left my pajamas in the room and only noticed when I got to the holiday destination but thought no worries picking up thecar in a week's time I will call in to Reception which I did. Told them I had been in Room 10 a week ago but staff said no pajamas. Either the cleaner took them or simply threw them away. I emailed the General Manager and have heard nothing. Considering we paid £186 for the room and we had to leave at 2am in the morning and we were told there would be breakfast bags to Takeaway which there wasn't I think it is not good value. Surely a hotel of this size must have some sort of Lost Property system in place.
4767,Mrs,2022-06-08,"Very good  The take away breakfast was poor in comparison if had a full breakfast for the same price. Banana, breakfast bar, OJ and pain au chocolate did not warrant a B&B price"
4768,Tracy,2022-06-08,Overnight stay The staff were brilliant in the restaurant and bar area. The menu and food were very basic. The communal areas were quite dirty
4769,Patricia,2022-06-08,Just want we needed and so clean and very helpful staff on reception  Disappointing menu but everything else very good. Would stay again
4770,Kevin,2022-06-08,Good Located Fire door outside room banged due to door dampers not working
4771,Terry,2022-06-07,Great location within the airport - value for money. Very friendly and efficient booking in on the day. Room was very comfortable and spotless. Breakfast was excellent and plentiful. 👍 -
4772,Alex,2022-06-07,Good Amazing provision of takeaway breakfast for early morning flyers. Could be more sound proofed.
4773,Zak,2022-06-07,"absolutely perfect for a nights rest before and after any holiday trip very close to the airport, so incredibly convenient! the food is pricey whilst being nothing more special than wetherspoons food. We weren’t personally fans of the pillows"
4774,Neil,2022-06-07,I would use it again Location excellent for an early morning flight Not easy to get into hotel from multi storey story carpark at night
4775,Alec,2022-06-07,"A good place to get your head down after a long uncomfortable night flight Convenient location after a night flight, so we were both tired and just wanted a comfy bed for a few hours. It was all fine"
4776,Judith,2022-06-07,"Good close to airport, very friendly stuff, clean The restaurant could be a touch better, but I have to say we stayed just after travels started to pick up"
4777,Chris,2022-06-06,"Only stayed one night and very pleasant. Breakfast was lovely and plentiful,good choices. Airport nice and close. room wasreally nice. passage from the airport was in places steepish, which some people should be aware of."
4778,Cindy,2022-06-06,"I liked the facilities, food and comfortable room, but as I normally travel alone it was expensive for single occupancy very convenient for the airport. food very good. expensive if you were travelling alone. no single rooms."
4779,Katrina,2022-06-06,"very convenient for airport if pricey location, check in, comfy bed price was rather high at over £200"
4780,Paul,2022-06-05,Very good Easy check in. Comfortable room
4781,Sue,2022-06-05,"Very good Breakfast selection was Ok, the hot dishes could have been hotter, Our room was was of the ground floor, I did not like we had people walk past our window . I found this to be very disconcerting."
4782,Scott,2022-06-05,Very good Location and service v good. We didn't have time for breakfast as our flight was so early.
4783,Gazk,2022-06-05,"Comfortable hotel very close to airport. Arrived very late after a delayed flight - 2.45am But at least we got some sleep before heading home the next day. Room was comfortable, but we didn't have breakfast - needed to get as much sleep as possible. A later check out would have been appreciated."
4784,Joanne,2022-06-05,"Perfect location for airport We had an early flight so it was perfect location being a 5 minute walk from the airport. Nice toiletries. Tea and coffee is room which is always a plus! The room was spacious and clean. Unfortunately we did not have time for breakfast, which was included as we had to check in. I would imagine lots of people miss out on breakfast due to early flights but I don’t remember seeing any options excluding breakfast (i could be wrong). Staff not overly friendly, just ok."
4785,Grocott,2022-06-04,"Good Room.was clean., good shower and comfortable bed Not much of a choice at breakfast at 5am. Overpriced , but convenient for the airport"
4786,Eve,2022-06-04,"quiet and very comfortable room was just what I needed after a flight delay clean and quiet room none, it was as expected"
4787,Mary,2022-06-04,ok but have had better there easy access to airport too many crowds and not enough staff to handle
4788,Tracey,2022-06-04,Superb short walk to the airport.
4789,Beverley,2022-06-04,"It does what it says on the tin! Room was good, shower excellent. Therr weren’t enough staff to cope with the influx of very close to the airport"
4790,Ian,2022-06-03,excellent faculties but very limited on catering. much queuing and poor coffee quality proximity cleanliness friendliness catering was mediocre
4791,Penelope,2022-06-03,"Better than I remembered Hotel was very busy and airport in chaos, but the staff had it all in hand and were managing smoothly with a smile on their faces. Very generous check out policy when our flight was delayed Food is a bit Meh, though breakfast from 4am was appreciated"
4792,Paula,2022-06-02,"Superb Clean rooms, comfortable and value for money"
4793,Louise,2022-06-02,"Ideal location beside airport but very expensive. Perfect location, good room. Restaurant food below par for this standard of hotel. Overpriced."
4794,Linda,2022-06-02,great proximity to Bristol Airport the location to Bristol airport only stayed overnight so no comments
4795,Claire,2022-05-31,Superb The staff were friendly and the hotel was very comfortable and clean. Our 2nd stay at this hotel and would stay again and recommend We were pleased with everything
4796,Peter,2022-05-31,"Convenient for the airport not best value Everything was as expected, check in very smooth The reception area was very busy with no real 'restaurant' didn't look to see if menu had changed"
4797,David,2022-05-31,comfortable and great location all ok nothing
4798,Christine,2022-05-31,"Walking distance to the airport terminal at Bristol Right next to Bristol airport, it only took 3 minutes to walk there for a very early flight. We had to leave too early to get breakfast!"
4799,Ros,2022-05-30,Very good staff on reception especially 30/5/22 08.30 ? Muni poor breakfast especially sausages
4800,Andrew,2022-05-30,"Superb Close to the airport, clean helpful staff A greater choice on the menu would be good"
4801,Lucie,2022-05-30,"comfortable but dining experience could be better very convenient - 2mins walk to airport Food was expensive for what was provided (quality / taste / portion size), if better quality price would be reasonable."
4802,Malcolm,2022-05-30,Very good proximity to airport
4803,Sarah,2022-05-30,Superb literally next to the airport so perfect for catching an early flight. Breakfast available from 4am! comfortable bed nothing really
4804,Jo,2022-05-29,early morning flight makes a pre flight hotel essential. located on the main Bristol Airport site. a short walk from the terminal. as the airport struggles to administer flights a pre flight hotel is essential. early morning flights are severely impacted. travel to the airport the night before and maximise your sleep. the staff at the hotel are warm and welcoming it's a shame that that the hotel fails to deliver the basics: bed - wobbles around shower - cold
4805,Cindy,2022-05-28,"when your late flight is delayed by 2.5 hours and you arrive at 2.30 am, it was so lovely to be welcomed by a very frien perfect for staying after returning from holiday on a late flight nothing"
4806,Jayne,2022-05-28,but worth it proximity to airport bit pricey
4807,Gregg,2022-05-27,End of holiday stay Extremely convenient location only 2 minutes from the terminal. Expensive. I would definitely consider somewhere a lot cheaper and pay for a taxi.
4808,Peter,2022-05-27,Excessive price Cleanliness and location Price excessive
4809,Kelly,2022-05-27,Superb Convenient for airport Restaurant was very basic
4810,Joanne,2022-05-27,"lovely friendly staff, clean comfortable rooms everything, no complaints I have no complaints"
4811,Steven,2022-05-27,"Airport hotel Ability to get up and go to the airport at 4am without the need for transfers. Pre packed breakfast bags for our collection on reception. Very quiet room which had all the facilities and was spotless. Long queue for the bar so we did not bother to have our nightcap, not enough staff (or under-trained) which caused this problem and delayed check in as well. No adequate signage from the multi storey car park which meant a long walk in the rain to find the hotel entrance."
4812,Rachael,2022-05-26,"location great , early start breakfast no real option and no staff to help with breakfadt bags location no breakfast choice at 3am ( as its an airport hotel i am sure most visitors have an early start at the airport thats why they are staying)"
4813,Philip,2022-05-25,Very good as always Good service as usual. right hotel in the right place. dinner menu quick service but poor choices
4814,David,2022-05-25,Expensive way to reduce stress of early start. Provided packed breakfast for early start. Price.
4815,Kate,2022-05-25,Bedroom was clean and well appointed. The bar / restaurant area is soulless and the staff were disorganised. At leas Fantastic location to Bristol Airport. The bar / restaurant service was really poor with long queues in order to be served.
4816,Elaine,2022-05-25,Just what was needed pre and post holiday Fantastic bed-huge! Great shower Quiet Great breakfast choice On site Food was reasonably priced and good Had 2 visits either side of holiday and air con on first stay far too cold-think engineers were working on it
4817,Jackie,2022-05-24,Superb We were still greeted by friendly staff after delayed flight at 2.00 am
4818,Dika,2022-05-24,"Superb breakfast very good, lots of choice"
4819,Michelle,2022-05-24,"Convenient for airport, breakfast good, bar evening meal poor standard. Up to early for breakfast this stay, but have had breakfast at hotel previously and breakfast is good, did order an evening meal and it was definitely below standard very disappointed. Evening meal very poor, not a fresh cooked meal at all."
4820,Karen,2022-05-23,"Absolutely fabulous! Great location exceptionally clean quiet rooms. Very comfortable bed! dreamy shower. Good value food. Crazy queues for check in this could be improved. I initially felt put off as it was the first opinion of hotel, however everything improved from this point onwards."
4821,Mark,2022-05-23,"Good, not great Location for airport could not be better. Brand new hotel, everything clean and tidy Slow check in, cott not in room when requested and when delivered dumped in room hallway without being able to get it past the bed and into the room. Breakfast bags provided for those departing before 4am, but no pre-orders taken for these. None left when we got to the lobby so we had to go without."
4822,William,2022-05-23,Good to have hotel provide dinner and breakfasts so near to the terminal. check in and check out breakfast set up able to walk to terminal Short staffed at dining. Only one person. sometimes 2 who took orders and then had to fill the drinks before being able to attend to next person in line. Waiting in line took long.....15 + minutes to be. More staff at dinner time to handle the number of customers. dinner was brought to table efficiently and was a good curry dinner.
4823,Heather,2022-05-23,Comfortable stay Clean and comfortable and very close to the airport which is helpful when catching an early flight. Nothing
4824,Becky,2022-05-23,Good Lovely room with easy and quick access to the airport. Bar was understaffed meaning there was a long queue for food and drinks. Evening meal wasnt the best quality but the buffet breakfast was outstanding. Think it is a little bit overpriced but we would stay again.
4825,Jill,2022-05-22,"Convenient for the airport, great breakfast Close to airport for late arrivals. Great breakfast. Nothing"
4826,Nigel,2022-05-22,Satisfactory. Good location for the airport. Breakfast (although early 6.30am had no eggs!). Otherwise all ok.
4827,Ian,2022-05-22,excellent design nil
4828,Chris,2022-05-22,Superb Location Comfortable rooms Good choice on breakfast Not a good choice for evening menu. Needed more variety
4829,Linda,2022-05-22,Good Good choice of breakfast When we were booked in the rate on the sign in sheet was completely wrong and if I hadny noticed it I would have been charged £80 more than I was expecting Not a good start
4830,Richard,2022-05-22,Fine ! Pleasant & helpful staff. Proximity to airport Only 2 tissues left in box !
4831,Tina,2022-05-21,Pretty good but the early breakfast should be out earlier Not much Fruit still frozen in middle and yogurt poor taste
4832,Yvonne,2022-05-21,It was fine for our purpose but the food needs stepping up. Happy with the room and service. The food is appalling and we’re not fussy eaters. It was just the same the last time we stayed.
4833,Clare,2022-05-21,"Good Excellent location. Good size room and friendly staff. I would happily stay there again. There was an issue at check in, all the computers were down which caused a delay. This was not the fault of the staff, who were trying their best to deal with the situation in a polite and friendly manner, however after a long day of travelling and arriving quite late, it added to my tiredness!"
4834,Kate,2022-05-21,"Great location for airport Excellent location. Nice staff. Lovely breakfast options. Perfect for the airport, literally 5 mins walk"
4835,M,2022-05-20,Very good Staff were very welcoming and helpful on arrival and departure. The room was perfectly adequate for our needs and was very quiet - which was unexpected and very welcome. The breakfast was fine with a varied choice. I was impressed with the electronic noticeboard in the breakfast/lounge area that listed flight arrivals and departures - it appeared to be the same as the one used in the airport. The pillows. I prefer a slim to medium thickness pillow. The 2 pillows provided were much thicker than I'd prefer.
4836,Kitti,2022-05-19,"Superb The self-service breakfast was excellent. So many choices, and using a tray made everything easier. Just like in the good old days at school. I hope the management appreciates the staff."
4837,Sharon,2022-05-19,"functional, let’s face it who chooses to stay in an airport hotel?! the staff were young and lovely even when clearly pushed by so many visitors house keeping need to hoover under the beds! I also would have loved a non caffeine late night drink - herb teas?"
4838,David,2022-05-19,Superb convenient location for early departure or a late arrival … staff very friendly
4839,William,2022-05-19,Great for overnight stay before early flight. Really handy for overnight before we flew and we could check our luggage in the night before. Made the whole security check much easier as did the paid for fast track. Very busy bar service for both drinks and food as the hotel doesn't have a restaurant as such. The staff were doing their very best but they had a lot of people to serve.
4840,Rosalind,2022-05-19,convenient location price
4841,Lewis,2022-05-19,Very good It was in a good location to get to the airport for an early flight. The food menu seemed limited and they didn’t accept cash. It was my understanding that cash was still legal tender 🤷‍♂️
4842,Scott,2022-05-18,splendid stay here before my flight room very smart and clean shower was cheap
4843,Julie,2022-05-18,"Very convenient location. Very close to airport terminal. Basic , reasonably comfortable room. Convenient! Pillows were terrible.. flat and hard. Nobody answered at reception on repeat calls to change them/ get more."
4844,David,2022-05-18,Very convenient and practical Position
4845,Laurence,2022-05-17,"Generally good room but breakfast disappointing. Excellent location. Breakfast was quite disappointing, no staff, no fried eggs, fruit salad was clearly from a low range catering tin. Layout not intuitive at all. The shower in the room did not drain fast enough to prevent overflow."
4846,Mark,2022-05-17,"Nice and convenient for the airport, slightly overpriced though.... Hotel nice and quiet and really handy if you have an early morning flight and need are travelling to the airport the day before. Check in took absolutely ages as the payment systems were down. Eventually got booked into my room and the payment was taken during the early hours of the next morning. Once I got to my destination country I had a notification off my card provider to say the hotel had taken the same payment again. So did the person I was travelling with. Could not get hold of them by phone so upon arrival back to Bristol Airport had to physically go in the hotel wait for ages in the que and then take the issue up with the person on the check in desk. It was resolved but was hassle I could have done without."
4847,Barbara,2022-05-17,"excellent , staff were so helpfull location nothing"
4848,Neil,2022-05-17,"Superb Close to terminal and parking, good clean hotel with cooked breakfast."
4849,Mike,2022-05-17,"All good apart the pillows! Member of staff at front desk very good, great ambassador for Hilton well done"
4850,Julie,2022-05-17,"Perfect place for an early flight. Close to the airport, room was very clean Very busy reception with only one person in check-in."
4851,Susan,2022-05-16,"Stay would I have been marked better if evening food menu better Room clean. Early serving of breakfast. Location Evening meal menu disappointing, service station, fast food the only option"
4852,Robert,2022-05-16,Over all satisfactory The location was central to my travel and it worked out well The Parking. Unfortunately having to pay for parking is a massive dissapointment. In Ireland the one good thing is people staying in the hotel have free parking. This was also not advertised that you had to pay the parking and if it was not for the staff explaining how to do the parking I would have ended up with a large unexpected bill. The bar was cashless. The other issue was the bar/restaurant was cashless. If you did not have a credit card then you could not purchase any food or drink.
4853,Zena,2022-05-15,Very good  Price doubled since my stay in Jan 2022
4854,Colin,2022-05-15,It was good apart from the pillows Good The pillows are awful
4855,David,2022-05-15,all in all fine would stay again directions from air terminal no lights on the floor from lift could not see directions to room number
4856,Christopher,2022-05-15,Good proximity to airport very pricey for no frills accommodation
4857,Lisa,2022-05-15,"Very good The location for a very early flight the following day.The room was very clean and comfortable When we stayed before, we were able to have a continental breakfast, but the time that starts appear to have changed, so unable to have it as our check in was at 0400 which was a shame"
4858,Martino,2022-05-15,"Superb Very nice room, spacious and clean. Few steps from the airport, it's ideal to catch early morning flights"
4859,Angela,2022-05-14,we were only there a few hours as we had to be at the airport for 3am so no time for breakfast it is so close to the airport the price
4860,Alison,2022-05-13,"Superb Size and comfort of beds, good breakfast selection, helpful friendly staff."
4861,Barrie,2022-05-13,great location and reasonably priced handy for the airport and parking beds a little too hard for us
4862,Kamila,2022-05-13,Place to sleep but not to eat Everything apart from food. Food.
4863,Kathleen,2022-05-12,Convenient stopover but at a price. Within walking distance of Bristol airport. Modern hotel. Nice food. Our pre booked cot for baby wasn’t in room. Only towels for one person in twin room. Pricey.
4864,Cheryl,2022-05-12,great very modern and close to the airport
4865,Wendy,2022-05-12,"Perfect short stay before early flight. So convenient for a very early flight at the airport. Room and shower room modern, well equipped and comfortable. Good evening meal and could even take some breakfast with us. A bath would have been nice as well as a shower."
4866,Samantha,2022-05-12,"would definitely stay again friendly staff, convenient location. slippery shower tray. drinks on the bar were expensive. bed a little too hard."
4867,Mario,2022-05-12,Good  The way that the food section operated. We had ordered some fish and chips. Fish was not cooked properly. Waited ages and then we were told it could be cooked again I said we will get a sandwich from Airport no offer of a refund!! Totally unprofessional . The room excellent very clean even showerhead . Check in professional and friendly . The above was a big let down
4868,Geoffrey,2022-05-12,"Very good location for airport very quiet slept well. Didn't have breakfast was an early morning flight We asked for an early morning call which we didn't get, we asked at reception and they said the phone in our room didn't work. Not very good!!"
4869,Jayne,2022-05-12,"fully recommend this hotel for airport stay excellent location for travelling, staff were very helpful poor choice of food for evening meal"
4870,Robert,2022-05-11,"Very good Lovely atmosphere, comfortable room, friendly staff. Breakfast included in room price but not available for us as we had a 6am flight as our flight was at 6am and we had to leave the hotel before breakfast. Therefore paid for something that wasn't available. No option when booking room to not pay for breakfast."
4871,Jennifer,2022-05-11,"Superb Lovely room, easy walking distance to the terminal The food was good - we both had a curry. We will stay there again."
4872,Phillip,2022-05-11,"clean, tidy, comfortable hotel that does what it says! clean and functional. friendly welcome by the check in staff having to cue up to order evening meal and drinks. not the greatest way to start a holiday but I guess this property is simply a transit stay for early morning next day flights. the smell of burnt toast at 5am in the morning was also a bit off putting."
4873,Jeff,2022-05-11,"Superb Location convenience, Room excellent Staff very helpful"
4874,David,2022-05-09,our stay was short but food was good and easy access to airport very close to the airport for early am flight nothing
4875,Eleanor,2022-05-08,Very good Great room location Price time of breakfast
4876,John,2022-05-07,"Decent stay at Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport Check in was excellent, really attentive, genuinely friendly and helpful. I travel a lot and so often reception and check in is awful. It's the first contact the guest has with the hotel and important to be right. Room was comfortable, clean and generally quiet. Asked for a quiet room away from lift traffic and was accommodated. Food ordering system and other pushy customers jumping the queue. Appeared that some groups had package holiday vouchers which, to them, meant entitlement and special treatment. It's a package holiday airport hotel so I suppose that is to be expected. Food was OK, bar team very helpful given the circumstances."
4877,Frank,2022-05-07,"great hotel for early or late airport arrival quick check in, good breakfast and nice rooms"
4878,Jean,2022-05-07,"Very good Airport, room and breakfast good value"

4882,Heather,2022-05-06,Superb Easy checkin. Room perfect for family of 3 Beds comfortable and spotlessly clean Also so close to airport for an early flight Nothing
4883,Kevin,2022-05-05,So comfortable and convenient for an early flight. Hot Breakfast is very good. Early cold breakfast is available from 4.00 hrs for early flights. Evening meal is very limited and is obviously frozen and microwave/oven but nicely presented. There is a bar which includes limited draught beers.
4884,Russell,2022-05-05,"Very nice hotel, great location, but the price had gone up a lot The airport location, cleanliness and staff friendliness were excellent The price had gone up significantly compared to other times I've booked this."
4885,Barbara,2022-05-04,convenient and adequate the location and ease of arrival the fan in the bathroom ran noisily all night.
4886,Susan,2022-05-04,"Comfortable, good welcome but could have done more for very early morning flight food Good location The hotel were fully aware of earlier check outs ,telling us to get to the airport by 4am but breakfast started at 4am so in my opinion knowing the ongoing problems at airports ,should have had 3.30am access to continental breakfast at least or bread roll jam and butter in room come on Hampton !"
4887,Mike,2022-05-04,Superb Spacious clean hotel right at the airport. .Early check-in was a bit annoying. We had to join the Hilton club to check-in early.
4888,Clare,2022-05-03,"Comfortable stay, very convenient for airport Location Arrangements for evening meal"
4889,Crampton,2022-05-03,"I would definitely stay again Reception staff on checking in were excellent, and very helpful."
4890,Veronica,2022-05-02,Good  Couldn't open the windows!
4891,Ghislaine,2022-05-02,Superb The location is perfect if you need to stay near the airport. The room are comfortable and clean. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was good. All in all very good value for money.
4892,Lam,2022-04-30,Really nice but except for not having toothpastw big rooms no toothbrush and toothpaste
4893,Stephen,2022-04-30,"very convenient for airport, clean modern hotel very convenient for airport"
4894,Barbara,2022-04-28,"Late night arrival hotel stay The location is ideal for a very late arrival flight. The room is clean and the bed comfy. Lots of choice at breakfast. I received many messages to use the online key, but it wouldn't activate, although I continued to receive more messages to use it. The cooked breakfast is luke warm and over cooked."
4895,Linda,2022-04-28,Very good Location is excellent. Room very clean. Evening meal starter and main were both lukewarm. Breakfast no eggs. Not enough room at side of bed.
4896,Sarah,2022-04-28,"Superb Breakfast was good, we left early so only had the continental but good choice"
4897,Julie,2022-04-27,Superb Ideal for overnight stay before flight Food selection is slightly limited
4898,Gemma,2022-04-27,good location all fine
4899,Penny,2022-04-27,"very handy for airport, only scrambled eggs at breakfast near airport food not great"
4900,Jeffrey,2022-04-27,We enjoyed our stay but we found it expensive and would only use it on certain occasions. Continental breakfast adequate. The position to the airport was perfect and the room was adequate for the night and very clean. It is a Hotel that is used by the airport passenger and as such is very good.
4901,Kim,2022-04-26,"Expensive for what it was 2 minutes walk to airport terminal iron, ironing board & hairdryer in room. Quiet room, great shower. room had everything needed for 1 night stay Wake up call not received, could have missed flight had we not set alarm on phone Early morning breakfast is buffet which is to be expected at 4.30am but breakfast area very messy. Evening meal was poor"
4902,Iwona,2022-04-26,"Superb Nice, clean and comfortable room in good location"
4903,Mrs,2022-04-26,"Perfect for a relaxed, comfortable pre flight stay. Easy check in, comfortable and quiet room. Good food menu although several items were out of stock. What we had was very nice, however. Nicely stocked bathroom, comfy mattress so we slept well and it was a fast check out. Also able to walk to the airport easily. One long queue to order food and drink which meant we couldn't be bothered to order more drinks. One lady decided to walk over to the airport to get something instead."
4904,Philip,2022-04-26,Superb convenient for the airport very quiet pricey
4905,Juan,2022-04-25,Good Breakfast cold and not fresh at 7am. Poor facilities upon arrival 10pm. Rather expensive for what is no more than a premier inn type hotel. See above
4906,Leonard,2022-04-25,"Reasonable, but overpriced stay Excellent location on the airport site Very expensive for an airport hotel"
4907,Bernard,2022-04-24,Great location BUT.. .V convenient for the terminal V limited food choice in the restaurant. Carpet in the room was dirty and beneath the bed was unsavoury. No trolleys available at the hotel to transport luggage to the terminal. No instructions for using the heating system.. it was either too hot or too cold. It was always noisy.
4908,Cheryl,2022-04-24,"Good place to stay for Bristol airport, would recomend. Easy check in, with friendly staff and a nice welcome. Parking was easy. Communication before arrival was excellent. Cleanliness of room was excellent and comfortable bed. An extra pillow would have been nice. The coffee and tea tray would have benefitted from a biscuit as well. No internet charging socket was available which would have been really useful."
4909,Holly,2022-04-22,"Would book again, hopefully they will sort out the breakfast issue. Good location, nice rooms which were all very clean. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was dry and unappealing even though I came down 10 min after it was served. They didn’t have lids on the food under the heat lamps so the eggs, mushrooms etc had all dried out."
4910,Tegid,2022-04-22,Excellent location. We will certainly stay there again if we fly from Bristol Rooms are well designed Breakfast was OK but after a week in nice Spanish hotels was a bit of a let down
4911,Chejon,2022-04-21,Very good 👍👍
4912,David,2022-04-21,"A really great way to start our visit after a flight and journey. Easy transfer from arrivals to hotel, staff helpful, welcoming, nice food and drink in evening, great breakfast.Room comfortable and clean just what we needed to start our visit to UK. Can't really find any fault."
4913,Margaret,2022-04-21,"excellent , fulfilled the purpose proximity to airport. wonderful breakfast included and served from 4 am no views from bedroom window"
4914,Caroline,2022-04-20,Great location for early flights from Bristol airport. Great location on site at Bristol airport - just a few minutes walk to terminal. Rooms were better than expected - comfy beds and good shower. No bags available for the grab and go breakfast and we didn’t have time to eat in. Quite expensive for a family for one short night.
4915,Lewis,2022-04-19,Fabulous Easy to get to and very convenient for the airport in the morning. The bar closed at 10 and then after was only room service. No parking packages so you can only leave your car for the duration of your stay. (Previously this was different)
4916,Jacqueline,2022-04-19,"Very good Food was excellent and staff were helpful and friendly Only one pillow, and the one pillow we had was too soft"
4917,Ian,2022-04-19,pleasant stay what I expected location menu could have been better
4918,Rosalind,2022-04-19,Best option for getting some sleep before/after late/early flights Convenience second to none. Staff always friendly. Great that you accommodate families with children in a room with a sofa bed; if you ever stopped doing that we would look elsewhere!
4919,Mark,2022-04-19,Very good Really helpful
4920,Esther,2022-04-18,Superb A few minutes walk from the terminal so ideal for an early morning flight. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Breakfast served from 4am.
4921,Terrence,2022-04-18,Very good Location is perfect for a short walk to the terminal and also to the long stay and multi story carparks. Great breakfasts. The dinner food.
4922,Sabine,2022-04-17,"good sleep, good breakfast, very relaxed arriving at the airport. 5 min Walk to the airport, perfect for an early departure or late arrival. the room was nice with a sofa that opened for a bed. breakfast starts as early at 4, the cooked breakfast at 6. we had time for the English breakfast and enjoyed it. we heard no planes in the room. the bed felt really uncomfortable, but we still slept really good. I found it quite expensive but I guess the easy airport access makes a part up fort it."
4923,Sue,2022-04-17,Very good where it’s situated not enough pillows please pop more on
4924,Sarah,2022-04-17,"Good location for the airport as just a short walk but you are paying a premium for the convenience The hotel was really near the airport and had ample parking. Breakfast was available for early travellers. It was expensive for just one night as not a high brow hotel. The food was pretty basic, you could tell came from a supermarket, but cooked well."
4925,David,2022-04-16,Very satisfactory and the discount on overnight parking was much appreciated Good breakfast The eating area a bit utilitarian and the tables seemed sticky
4926,Bowler,2022-04-16,Easter 2022 The food was excellent. Very clean and the staff were very nice Nothing for the children to do. It would have been nice to have a adventure play ground or something where the children could remove some of there excessive amount of energy
4927,Jane,2022-04-16,Good start to the holiday. Fairly good choice. Available to take away at 4am which was very good. Very little choice for evening meal.
4928,Tracey,2022-04-16,"Very good It's a great location, clean and comfortable The exterior automatic doors weren't working. There was no sign to explain that, they were very difficult to open and even the staff didn't comment or apologise"
4929,Lleucu,2022-04-15,Good convenient and close to airport uncomfortable pillows
4930,Melanie,2022-04-15,value for money clean near to airport nothing
4931,Tony,2022-04-15,"Great location, we started our holiday feeling refreshed after a great nights sleep. great location tables remained uncleaned throughout the evening and breakfast sitting."
4932,Alex,2022-04-14,Very good Good stay for early flight next morning
4933,Dawn,2022-04-14,"Peaceful, comfortable retreat. Loved that it was within walking distance of the airport terminal and yet was remarkably quiet - inside you could not hear all the planes landing and taking off at all hours. My international flight was at 6am so I had to be at the terminal at 4am and was too early for any breakfast."
4934,Joanna,2022-04-12,convenient close to terminal bed like rock black mould inside shower screen at the base
4935,Jones,2022-04-11,"Very good Convenient for airport Outward - 5.15am no croissants. Homeward-cooked breakfast cold and hard food. Not enough staff, they were really busy 1 staff on reception but a phone call took them away and left people waiting. 1 staff on drink/food, needs 2"
4936,Alastair,2022-04-09,"Good clean, quiet, and close to airport water not hot, just tepid, in the morning!"
4937,Shirleyhedges,2022-04-09,Perfect for early morning flight.Breakfast from 4am or takeaway breakfast. Early breakfast 4am.In airport nothing
4938,Ann,2022-04-09,"Perfect for an airport stopover. We arrived very early in the r morning and were leaving again soon after. the staff wer 2 minutes walk from the terminal, early breakfast on offer would have been nice to have had bottled water in the room"
4939,Jane,2022-04-08,Very good Convenient for airport and parking Restaurant and menu rather basic.
4940,Laura,2022-04-08,"Modern hotel with lovely staff, could improve menu options The front desk staff were super friendly and went above and beyond to ensure we didn't pay any extra for parking or late checkout. Even though there was no room service available we asked the staff and they allowed us to collect the food from the restaurant and take it back to the room with us. The room was modern and clean, we weren't woken up by any noise from the airport or other guests. The complementary breakfast had everything you could want. There weren't a tonne of food options for the evening meal, mostly fast food like burgers, pizza, potato wedges, and a daily dish (one meat, one vegan). Because of the location there aren't any other places to eat, so you're really stuck with just the selection there."
4941,Sophie,2022-04-08,Much better than I ever expected Close to airport Nothing
4942,Jacqueline,2022-04-07,Good Close to airport and good breakfasts

4947,Karen,2022-04-05,"good location as I arrived late in the evening good location from the airport i arrived late at night, I would have loved a little biscuit to have with my late night cup of tea"
4948,Peter,2022-04-05,Very good Easy access to Parking and airport. Shower didn't drain. No one in reception to tell Couldn't find a phone number to call them. Room 269.
4949,Anne,2022-04-04,"A decent sleep before driving home It was good to be able to stay overnight after a long day before driving home. The hotel is close to the terminal and car park so it doesn't take long to reach either on foot. Dinner and breakfast both OK but not special, staff friendly and room comfortable. Our room was quite far from reception and we were tired. When we stayed the night before departure we were on the ground floor quite close to reception which would have better suited a couple of pensioners!"
4950,Hemina,2022-04-04,"The breakfast is good, the rooms are quiet and it’s a short walk to the airport. Convenient to the airport"
4951,Frances,2022-04-03,"Convenient but expensive The convenience of being at the airport for an early morning flight The room is much more expensive,than it was I would be unlikely to book here again"

4953,Ann,2022-04-03,Superb Overall very good Coming home to a parking fine of £100 when we only dropped off our cases. I hope this is being dealt witj
4954,Annabel,2022-04-03,"A great airport hotel, super service and very clean rooms which are a step up from a standard hotel. We didn’t manage breakfast as early check in, but the ease of parking, getting to the hotel from the carpark and then the terminal from the hotel was fantastic. The rooms were lovely too. Dinner was great in the hotel restaurant. I don’t have suggestions"
4955,Olivia,2022-04-03,convenient but little soul adjacent to airport not much character in rooms. The woodwork was like Travelodge
4956,Kim,2022-04-02,too tired to return to desk to devise re bloody tissue in lift otherwise okay close to airport really lovely toiletries accessible shower was amazing great choice at breakfast easy check in/check out Blood stained (what looked like) tissue in one of lifts. One pillow each which was far too soft. Being charged £5 to come into car park to collect bags even tho we had been on long stay car park for one week already.
4957,George,2022-04-01,Superb Location is fine for the airport but price was a bit dear
4958,Nathan,2022-03-31,"Very good Great staff and also breakfast, a short stay but comfortable bed. Would have been nice if the heating had been on as it was a cold night in and out"
4959,Stuart,2022-03-31,convenient convenient understaffed
4960,Karen,2022-03-31,"Good location being woken up at 11 pm by reception asking what our booking reference was because they had allocated us the wrong room, we we up at 3am for a flight. As you can appreciate it was very difficult for us to go back to sleep. Plus no cash !!!!!"
4961,Simon,2022-03-30,"We’ll be back. Excellent all round - good choice of food and drink in the evening, all you can eat breakfast. Next to the airport and still quiet. No grumbles."
4962,Carol,2022-03-29,Good ROOM AND SHOWER bREAKFAST
4963,Clarel,2022-03-29,Very good very central to airport some staff could be a bit more happier
4964,Lyn,2022-03-29,Very good slightly over priced the price
4965,Michael,2022-03-29,Good Location to airport Had to pay £5 in car park for family to drop us off. Extra expense not aware of.
4966,Nigel,2022-03-28,"Good but noisy room. We asked for a quiet room, but we ended up on a room opposite the car park which was noisy. See above."
4967,Anne,2022-03-28,Good location would have loved a bath
4968,Richard,2022-03-28,Serves the purpose we stayed for with early morning flight Location to airport. Very early breakfast available. Some of the elecrtrics in the room did not work but there were plenty of spare sockets
4969,Ceri,2022-03-27,Convenient staff were very friendly Bar area and no transfer to Airport
4970,David,2022-03-27,Superb perfect for our requirements nothing

4972,Collins,2022-03-26,Very good Good It was okey
4973,Elaine,2022-03-25,"Great location, clean rooms, pleasant staff. The location is second to none, staff are very pleasant and the rooms are spotlessly clean. We were taking an early morning flight and were very disappointed that there were no paper cups for us to get a coffee ‘on the go’ as there have been in the past - so no breakfast for us either as we don’t eat pastries. The hotel also needs some lighting to the outside of the main doors, it was very dark out there!"
4974,Gillian,2022-03-24,"ideal place to stay before an early morning flight. hotel well located, very well appointed with clean comfortable room location close to airport"
4975,Jodie,2022-03-24,"good before travelling, will ask for more pillows next time! location to the airport and clean, spacious room the bed, we had one pillow each and had the most rubbish night sleep before our flight."

4977,Anthony,2022-03-24,functional location food was only okay
4978,Stuart,2022-03-23,Good Everything is good except the cost of the drinks and in some cases the quality of the meals
4979,Stephen,2022-03-23,very good stay good room with friendly staff nothing all went well
4980,Dawn,2022-03-23,ok for a stop over ideal location. right next to the airport and long stay car park limited early breakfast but it was ok. sofa bed was horrendous though! ok for a small kid but mine is 17 and was very uncomfortable. it was extremely thin
4981,Dawn,2022-03-23,nice staff clean and ok for a night stop over location is perfect for going away. it’s also right next door to the long stay car park and airport entrance limited food choice and breakfast is a little basic but it’s ok for a travellers stop over
4982,Tracey,2022-03-23,"Excellent quality hotel at a reasonable price considering its 2 minutes walk from the airport Lovely chatty reception staff. Room spotless and comfortable and not too hot ! Breakfast was varied and fresh Room, pillows too hard and no choice of softer ones in room. No staff available to answer a question either at the desk or on the phone (05.15hrs)"
4983,Andrew,2022-03-22,convenient and comfy it was convenient and comfy
4984,Margaret,2022-03-21,"Great location and comfortable room but dire dining Pleasant clean and modern room, very quiet and comfortable. Breakfast is laid on from 4am, hot food from 6am and you can take away portable items if you don’t have time. Very close to airport terminal. The food and dining experience was on the level of a motorway services, and not the good services like Gloucester and Tebay either. You are effectively eating in the foyer, unable to get away from screens with football and the food itself is barely edible and certainly not wholesome, being largely white carb. The red lentil Dahl for £12.95 was very overpriced, devoid of flavour or spice. The felafel burger was also a very long way from the original concept. There is no signage to the hotel if you want to find a pedestrian/wheeled luggage route from the long stay car park to the hotel. If you are foolish enough to consider dropping off passengers and luggage before parking think again as a van patrols the airport looking for reasons to dine you £100. Happily we could park near enough in the end."
4985,Bryan,2022-03-21,well worth stay On-site for early morning flight nothing to fault
4986,Gill,2022-03-21,convenient. close to the airport Grandaughter dropped as off and having to pay £5 for 5minutes parking.

4997,Raymond,2022-03-16,"Superb Wifi, excellent availability of food late and early. Good staff Very little. As near as can be to the perfect airport hotel"
4998,Gordon,2022-03-16,"Very good Location, hotel new and still modern. Drop off parking fee's of £5.00 to drop my family off and then go to the long stay car park. Was only in the car park for 60 seconds max."
4999,Vanessa,2022-03-16,"It did the trick! The room was spacious, warm and comfortable. Really good facilities. We had supper which was fine and did what we needed it to do. We missed out on breakfast as we needed to get to the airport 2 hours before the 6 a.m. flight - never mind. I think windows not opening for me was the one thing I would have liked as I always sleep with a window open no matter what the weather is like. Circulating fresh air is always best."
5000,Ian,2022-03-15,"Good hotel, perfect spot, don't plan to leave your car there Simple, clean and as you would expect for a Hampton by the airport, breakfast was good and the room was comfortable. A bottle of water in the room is surely a basic expectation. Possibly my naivety, but I read the parking fee is a reduced £8 a day flat rate if you stay here, so planned to leave the car there for the 2 nights we were away, but its only £8 for the nights you stay there, then it jumps to £45, then £19 a night, so don't plan to leave your car here for your trip."
5001,Katrina,2022-03-14,Perfect for what we wanted for one night and an early start Ideal location for airport and long stay parking Menu in restaurant could be more varied but
5002,Ann,2022-03-14,used as very convenient for early morning flight convenient for airport nil
5003,Cox,2022-03-14,Review Lovely room and location No on demand movies as advertised on website. Although I did get a free drink to compensate. Requested a wake up call which I never received.
5004,Rosemary,2022-03-13,Good place to stay for easy access to airport. Beds extremely comfortable Good variety of food. Early morning availability Only one coffee machine working and it had run out of milk. Milk pots in short supply
5005,Xabiahelen,2022-03-13,Good hotel and perfect for Bristol airport. We didn't have breakfast as we had to be at the airport for 5.25am. Being so close to the terminal was good and only took us 5 minutes to walk there with our luggage. The room was comfortable but a little too cool for my husband.
5006,Katherine,2022-03-12,Great hotel for the airport Really friendly helpful staff. Comfy room and proximity to the terminal Nothing

5020,Michael,2022-03-08,very good. We will use it every time we have an early morning flight now modern clean and near airport I thought the car park would be free but reasonable overnight rate of £8

5022,Brendan,2022-03-07,Perfectly adequate hotel for a short stay either coming from or going to airport for onward trave Breakfast was very good with lots of choice for the price paid. Particularly liked the quality of the coffee which was excellent. Only one quibble - could have had some extra pillows in the room. My wife usually requires additional pillows due to a health condition.
5023,Thomas,2022-03-06,Good The doors at the entrance did not work correctly There was only two coffee machines at breakfast only one working and the second in bad repair

5025,Carol,2022-03-06,"A perfect place to stay before our early flight. The Hampton by Hilton is situated within easy walking distance of the airport terminal. The staff are polite and efficient. The rooms are clean and comfortable and there’s a restaurant on site which is handy, serving breakfast from around 5am."
5026,Heather,2022-03-06,"Very good Hotel is walking distance from the airport terminal. Reception staff were excellent - efficient, smiling, nothing was too much trouble. They have a safe luggage room if you want to leave your bags there. Also there are airport trolleys behind the hotel which you pay for and can then you can keep the trolley and some of your bags in the reception safe luggage room. Excellent for if you have an early departure. Bar staff were very friendly. Room spacious & comfortable - no noise from the airport."
5027,Susannah,2022-03-05,Eat before you get there proximity to airport departures rooms were quiet and comfortable good was terrible. after a long drive we needed a decent meal and the food was basic and of poor quality
5028,Elizabeth,2022-03-05,"nice welcome from the receptionist good to reach a peaceful and comfortable place. room was comfortable and clean breakfast was awful. anaemic coffee. no fresh fruit salad, just tinned. scramble egg anaemic. couldn't really find anything appetising to eat"
5029,Clairino,2022-03-05,Good location  The sofa bed is uncomfortable a single bed would be better in a designated family room.
5030,Rosamund,2022-03-04,"good location. menu lets the hotel down badly. 2nd time I have said this location , clean room unimaginative menu"
5031,Peter,2022-03-04,Superb Airport location good. But no provision for family to drop me off with heavy suitcase at the reception. A drop off point outside reception?????

5035,Helen,2022-03-03,"Massively convenient hotel for Bristol airport. This airport is on the doorstep of Bristol airport - a short walk, so massively convenient. The parking at the multi-story is also convenient and although expensive, we got a reasonable deal as we pre-booked. It's a nice touch having the boards up with the flights - really helpful to know whether to walk over or wait. The signage could be better - we ended up taking a long walk detour to get to the right walkway, when we could have gone through the hotel and walked out the other side - a simple thing to rectify if the owners choose to do so!"
5036,Peter,2022-03-03,"Convenient hotel, spotlessly clean with amazing staff and a good breakfast close to Bristol Airport. The staff were really helpful and friendly at the check in. We couldn’t get a taxi to take us to Bristol Temple Meads ( Sunday 27th Feb) and they went out of their way to go and find us a taxi, calling taxi companies, going up to the airport taxi rank etc. Nothing was was too much trouble for them. They were amazing ⭐️ It’s a bit far from the airport."

5060,Jo,2022-02-21,Very convenient for early flight Good choice for such an early start thank you. Some way of taking it away would have been good. The food in the evening was poor quality and poor value for money and and we had to wait for 40mins
5061,Chris,2022-02-21,"Very good Facilities and room are super. Breakfast available at 5AM, amazing. Very convenient for the airport, makes it super easy to get to your flight in the morning. The cooked food lets the hotel down, its very poor. Its not hotel standard. I'd say that even the large fast food chains provide a better quality of food."

5070,Elisabeth,2022-02-15,"We enjoyed our stay. However we felt the restaurant menu could be improved, although the staff were very helpful. Room and en-suite were very well equipped and the beds were comfortable. Walking distance to airport terminal. No night light or dimmer switch to facilitate access to bathroom at night without switching on main light which also reflects in mirror. A ramp from the hotel to the airport next to the steps would be better."
5071,Linda,2022-02-15,Very good Large single beds in twin room were very comfortable Bar area has limited seating
5072,Sean,2022-02-14,"Bristol airport hotel Room was set up as requested, and consideration was put into this request. The shower was blocked, it was really slowly draining. Not ideal."

5074,Elizabeth,2022-02-13,"Comfortable and convenient. Room. Nearness to airport. There is no courtesy bus to airport. Forced to hire taxi for a 5 min ride. Slope of hill up to airport too steep for elderly people with heavy luggage. No breakfast or even takeaway snack available for very early departures, even though it is included in the rate. Perhaps a small sealed picnic bag could be taken to room the night before an early morning departure."
5075,Craig,2022-02-13,"absolute shocking. stayed fo relieved stress if early flight and no-one on reception for 15 mins to get parking validat location procedure for ordering food and drink, very basic , un professional and staff with no knowledge or memory from order to serving within 2 minutes"

5081,Ann,2022-02-11,"Good comfortable choice if flying from Bristol Airport Friendly and helpful staff. Close to airport. Good breakfast with plenty of choice. Limited food choice in evening - but we were satisfied with baked potato, beans & salad. Access to airport with luggage for older people not so easy, but that is not the hotel's fault. Having said that, we would use again."
5082,Andrea,2022-02-10,"Short but sweet, great airport hotel. Breakfast was great, lots of choice, the staff were really friendly and the location couldn't be better placed to catch an early morning flight. Nothing, no complaints, but then I was only there to sleep and grab some food before jumping on a flight."

5084,Lawrence,2022-02-10,"I would stay again mainly because of the location people very helpful, room very clean and operational, location excellent Food was not good.....and expensive"

5086,Vivienne,2022-02-07,"Good very clean Would be good if there was extra pillows in wardrobe, one pillow each is below par!"
5087,Eileen,2022-02-07,"Functional and American style I liked this place, its functional for airport travellers and not really a holiday base. Great for late arrivals or very early departures. We walked from the airport and couldn't find the route so diverted a bit. Came in through the back entrance of the hotel eventually. Please ensure to signpost the walking route clearly from the airport."
5088,Nikki,2022-02-07,"Location and room were excellent. Staff were a little aloof and distracted. Not a very warm welcome Immaculate room, comfy bed, good shower Staff distracted at check in. Walked off half way through checking us in to deal with someone else. Not very welcoming or engaging"

Rooms are a little narrow and it’s quite pricey."
5091,Mj,2022-02-05,Excellent location with pleasant staff Pleasant staff and good location Overpriced for facilities provided. Excellent location but basic menu and much self service. Premier Inn is better value......
5092,Jennifer,2022-02-05,Very good  The breakfast was poor
5093,Richard,2022-02-04,Airport Hotel Proximity to the airport The chair in the room was probably the most uncomfortable chair I've ever sat in and was unable to use it.

5098,Jason,2022-02-01,"Overnight stay for early flight the next morning Clean, very quiet and extremely close to the airport arrivals, literally 5 minutes up the hill. Room was quite small, also overpriced for the size. No mini bar and also no free water provided which meant we had to buy water from downstairs."
5099,Sergio,2022-01-31,"Great for location Great Location, really nice staff The food was very basic with very limited choice."
5100,David,2022-01-31,Very good Great location at Bristol Airpirt The lounge area around the bar is fine but could be a little more comfortable. I would still use this hotel and bar area though.
5101,Susan,2022-01-31,"Very convenient for the airport, great room. Great room. Super comfortable bed. Dining experience wasn’t brilliant, little choice except burgers and curry, no table service at all, more difficult when you’re a line traveller."
5102,Jacqui,2022-01-31,Superb Close to airport. Room heating good. Tv n tea making facilities and clean room. Why do you only put TWO pillows on a double bed? What adult only has one pillow each? Please rectify this and then youll be top marks.
5103,Janice,2022-01-30,Ideally suited for airport. proximity to the airport was good. Shower in bathroom was very good. the basin in the bathroom was so far back I could hardly reach to clean my teeth!

5106,Stephen,2022-01-29,"Stress free way to start my trip from Bristol Airport. So handy for the airport, will use this next time I travel. Spotlessly clean throughout, friendly and helpful staff. Really great breakfast, and pretty decent evening meal. Don’t know why the other reviewers thought the food was poor. I don’t normally spend this much on a hotel, but in fact it’s worth it for the sheer convenience."

Nice, clean room, friendly staff We thought the evening meal choice & standard was poor, there wasn’t much on the menu that we fancied eating & the portions were small so not good quality for the money & my husband was still hungry after!

Staff friendly and welcoming. Check in and out efficient. Room was clean and pleasant. Decent shower. Didn’t eat there so can’t comment on food. Would have preferred two pillows to one soft but could presumably have gone to Reception to ask for another."
5114,Karen,2022-01-20,"Improve the pillows & it would be superb! Staff were very helpful & welcoming, everywhere was very clean, location excellent. Room was very comfortable apart from very poor quality pillow (very soft/unsupportive & only one per twin bed)"

Very good breakfast with impressive choice for such an early start (4.30am was when we went) - hot breakfast starts at 6am. We checked out access to airport the day before our flight: you can get a luggage trolley from near the hotel for £2 and use the ramped access to the terminal (we are in our 70s so it solved the problem of trying to lug heavy cases up flights of steps). We have booked again for our return flight."

5132,Simon,2022-01-12,"nice facility, clean, comfy and convenient… but eat before you stay. convenience. clean, modern and just what you need for a short (overnight stay) food in the restaurant was highly processed.. didn’t think you could make a bad cheese and bacon burger, but they managed it.. beef was finely ground patty and the bacon was anaemic…. should be able to do much better.."
5133,Alan,2022-01-11,"Very good Proximity to airport Comfortable room Excellent breakfast Evening meal was poor value, and the frozen vegetables were cold and unappetising. The meal was not up to hotel standards. General atmosphere of the dining area was cold and spartan. Stained upholstery and inadequate cleaning by staff"
5134,Sarah,2022-01-11,"Very convenient for an early start at the airport The room was very clean and comfortable and quiet. We had the continental breakfast as we had an early flight which was very well laid out and plentiful. The pillows were too soft We had evening dinner at the hotel but it took nearly an hour to arrive, which was not good, we complained and they gave us a round of free drinks as a gesture of good will. When the food was finally served it was nice and hot."
5135,Shirley,2022-01-11,"Very convenient clean facilities and lovely staff. Staff were lovely and very helpful. Room and facilities were very clean. Very accessible for airport terminal - couldn't have been any better. Pillows were so soft they were virtually non existent. No neck support at all. No second pillows available to provide extra support. Could not lie in bed and watch TV as could not prop yourself up enough. A small gripe I know but a little bit irritating, especially when everything else was absolutely fine."

5147,Raymund,2022-01-05,"We enjoyed the stay, the staff were excellent, the location ideal and cleanliness was superb. Breakfast was ok but if I was being honest the ingredients were quite average. The location right next to the airport was super convenient for covid testing and the flight we were taking. There was nothing much to complain about. Perhaps some extra signage to advise which exit to use for the airport when you had arrived via the car park entrance. Some extra pillows would have been nice since the booking was for a couple."
5148,Nazir,2022-01-05,Very good Clean rooms Heating in the room did not work too well. Food at the restaurant was really bad!
5149,Margaretta,2022-01-05,"Quiet rooms ,very convenient hotel ,short walk to the terminal of Bristol Airport . Excellent hotel to catch an early fl so convenient for the airport, facilities good"
5150,Markbrins,2022-01-04,Walking distance to terminal The bar prices were reasonable for both food and drinks
5151,David,2022-01-04,very clean hotel. very clean and very conveniently located downhill from the airport. not easy to carry/wheel cases uphill to the airport.
5152,Joanna,2022-01-04,"I would definitely stay at this hotel again for its convenient position close to Bristol Airport. The breakfast was a great self-service set up and good early start for those having to check-in for an early flight from Bristol Airport. A shame the waffle maker wasn't up and running early, but understandable. Having the live flight departures and arrivals information up in the restaurant area was helpful and reassuring. Initially, I was put off by the parking price information when I first arrived, but after visiting the hotel reception I learned that customers of the hotel paid a reduced overnight price which was far more bearable. It would be better if customers didn't have to pay for parking for the duration of their stay."
5153,Keith,2022-01-03,Ok Location was good did not have breakfast left to early No USB port stairs hadn’t been cleaned for a while ok
5154,Samantha,2022-01-03,"Fabulous and super friendly! We have stayed in many hotels all over the world but the customer service here was fabulous and up there with the best. So warm and genuine. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff really seem to enjoy working at the hotel and it shows. We were only at the hotel for 1 night but were made to feel so welcome from the moment we checked in. The restaurant was great too. Decent menu, service, quality and prices. It all felt very safe despite Covid and restrictions. The room was spotless. The very short distance from the airport terminal made it super convenient and there was ample parking outside. I honestly hate to leave any negative comment as the positives were so good but it would have been nice to have a bath in the room. I kind of expect that of a Hilton. The sofa bed's springs also dug in during the night but the soft quilt kind of helped detract from that!"
5155,Valerie,2022-01-03,Great for early flight Breakfast excellent No hairdryer in room
5156,Peter,2022-01-02,Short and convenient.. Flight was too early for breakfast. Hotel is convenient for early flights. Expensive
5157,Martin,2022-01-02,very convenient for airport so near the terminal very little room between the bed and the wall. the bed was very hard
5158,Nicola,2022-01-02,Perfect for what we needed and the staff were so helpful - would stay again Very clean and the staff were super helpful and friendly Food was quite basic - was ok but more choice as I would imagine a lot of people want to start a holiday staying here with a lovely meal
5159,Griffiths,2022-01-01,Superb Excellent location bang opposite Bristol airport. Great staff. Good food. Lovely shower!!! Comfy bed and quiet. One of the lifts shuddering! But apart from that all was great.
5160,Fuller,2021-12-31,Superb Clean functional room. Delicious breakfast and excellent selection. Helpful staff Furnishings were a little tired. Some carpets appear stained/dirty. Tables slow to be cleaned.
5161,John,2021-12-31,"accommodation fine but food appalling everything except the evening meal and bar At the Hampton our room and facilities were fine but the food at our evening meal was more than disappointing. It was probably the most unappetising food we have experienced. We had the falafel veggie burger described on the Menu as being with bread and butter pickle, tzatziki and chips, which were just cooked and only warm. The item came with ‘salad’, which was not described in the menu and which we were told was standard for a burger being lettuce, tomato, and onion. Not everyone likes onion and removing it from food after it has been sliced is equally unacceptable. It should be recognised on the menu, for customers to have a choice. The ‘bread and butter’ description was false as it was a Brioche, which is a sweet bun and totally unsatisfactory in a savoury dish. Staff and Manager were accommodating and helpful in accepting our criticism of the food. The bar serves only malt Scotch Whisky and Irish Whiskey which is an unacceptable and expensive choice when requiring a long whisky drink with a mixer ie ginger ale, where a Blended Scotch Whisky is the norm. These are supplied under numerous titles such as White&Mackay, Bells, Grouse, etc. etc. It feels like your captive audience is being held hostage."
5162,Sarah,2021-12-31,Fine for an overnight Very helpful and friendly check in from Gloria. Dining area and bar somewhat basic.
5163,Elizabeth,2021-12-30,We enjoyed another stay. It was very comfortable and welcome after a long day travelling. it’s extremely convenient if you are flying out of or into Bristol Airport I would like to know there is a courtesy bus to transfer you to and from the airport. Taxis are exorbitant and totally off the scale for such a short trip. It’s the only drawback.
5164,Dorothy,2021-12-30,excellent The location - took the stress out of an early flight nothing
5165,Andrew,2021-12-30,"Very good  Sanitation stations not filled to capacity, during the evening one was empty reported three times, and once to the Duty Manager next morning still empty 29/12/2021 reported yet again instantly changed by the morning staff. Very disgruntled that a senior team member did not follow up any action during his evening shift."
5166,Diarmuid,2021-12-28,"Very good breakfast good, location good walk to the terminal, hotel to terminal car park would help"
5167,Ana,2021-12-28,Very good How near from airport is this location. The room and the hotel were absolutely spotless. The breakfast was really nice. Just maybe the price for just one night was a bit expensive. But in general I really enjoyed my stay.
5168,Richard,2021-12-28,"Good room was good, the bed was to softened the bedding and pillows were not of a good quality the bed and the bedding, could of had a better food options, like bar baskets meals"
5169,Melanie,2021-12-27,Excellent Everyone was friendly and very helpful and the room was more than satisfying shower was excellent it was very clean to
5170,Duncan,2021-12-27,good but not without some disadvantages for passengers on very early flights convenient stay if you have an early morning flight had to leave hotel to check in for a very early flight. No coffee or snacks available although we had paid for breakfast.
5171,Elizabeth,2021-12-26,"Comfortable, friendly Location perfect for airport. Bed comfortable and quiet. Staff were very friendly. Check in and out very easy. Stains on bedroom carpet. Not enough staff, queues for the bar and to order food."
5172,Christine,2021-12-24,"Excellent place to stay when you have an early morning flight friendly staff, very comfortable, quiet room. Good evening meal and breakfast nothing"
5173,Wu,2021-12-24,Very good So close to the airport
5174,Lucy,2021-12-24,perfect for airport clean and comfortable
5175,Bill,2021-12-23,Superb How clean and spacious also right on the Airport
5176,Susan,2021-12-22,Convenient comfortable hotel to stay in for early departure from the airport. The location is excellent for the airport. Breakfast was a bit disappointing as the cooked option was late coming out & we did not have time before our check in to take advantage of it. However what was available was fine. We liked the idea that rooms were sealed after cleaning to comply with COVID regulations. Unfortunately a good number of people moving around the hotel were not wearing masks although we do realise that is something it's difficult for the hotel to enforce.
5177,Heaney,2021-12-22,Very happy. Would definitely stay again. Breakfast was great. Plenty of choice.
5178,Jo,2021-12-21,Superb So close to the airport - perfect for my early flight. They offered take away breakfast too for early flights. I didn't realise that I could park at the hotel so in future I will do that.
5179,Antony,2021-12-21,Kids in lobby  Children being allowed to run around in the lobby while others were trying to socially acceptably distance and eat or relax other guests should have been spoken to about their tolerance level of their children
5180,Jo,2021-12-20,Excellent sanctuary from stressful airport situation very convenient when my flight was cancelled. Super clean and comfortable. Spacious room Excellent breakfast a bit of interior noise
5181,Gaynor,2021-12-20,"overnight stay very good location for early morning flight food in restaurant for evening meal was very disappointing, wouldn’t eat there again. Breakfast however was of a good standard"
5182,Linda,2021-12-19,"Short and sweet. Good continental breakfast but couldn’t find any serviettes! No paper menus in the room, due to Covid restrictions."
5183,Deborah,2021-12-19,"Superb Very comfortable hotel, staff were lovely and very helpful"
5184,Margot,2021-12-19,Very good Brilliant location after a late flight arrival Nothing

5186,Angie,2021-12-17,"Hilton Location good , staff friendly. Food nice. Very quiet. Double bed comfy. Not cleaned properly, toilet seat had urine mark on. Shower not cleaned properly in corners. Sofa bed uncomfortable."
5187,Michael,2021-12-16,Very comfortable stay Evening meal good value and tasty. Staff pleasant and helpful. Convenient to airport terminal. upon booking it would have been helpful for guidance of location of long term car park and where best to park to reach the hotel on foot. Terminal direction signs in car park do not mention hotel and at night quite difficult to find the best pedestrian route. Now we know the layout will not be a problem in future.
5188,Keith,2021-12-16,Very good Excellent staff.Giving good service in difficult times.Early buffet breakfast very good. Prices bit high if you had family to cater for.
5189,Raymond,2021-12-15,Perfect for the airport Good room and very convenient for the airport. The cutlery at breakfast was filthy! Knives were encrusted with baked on food. Staff should be more careful when removing them from the dishwasher.
5190,Patricia,2021-12-15,Very good A great location. Overnight only for convenience to airport.
5191,Paul,2021-12-15,"excellent,no complaints. great value ,perfect location & friendly staff."

5194,Jacqueline,2021-12-12,Very convenient place to stay after a late night flight Greeted by pleasant reception staff. Room Very clean and the bed was comfortable. I had expected noise from the airport as its so near but didn't hear any noise. Good choice for breakfast
5195,Whittler,2021-12-12,"Very convenient, clean and well presented hotel Extremely convenient location situated a short walk between the multi storey car park and the terminal. Good size room, excellent bathroom. The website advised that food wasn't available in the evening so we took a prepared meal with u to eat in our room. On arrival there was clearly a good choice of food available via the bar."
5196,Noel,2021-12-11,"Perfect location, bit disappointed thereafter The location couldn't be better! The bed was very comfortable. It was expensive for what it was, I was surprised there were no USB charging points in the room. I had some time to kill in the morning before my afternoon flight and whilst waiting for my afternoon flight I ordered a tea and bottle of water which was hellish expensive and the water was only 330ml. I would have asked for a pint of tap water if I knew I'd be fleeced. Even the guy that served me seemed embarrassed."
5197,Martin,2021-12-10,Perfect night-before choice for that early flight Lovely staff. Just 5 minutes walk to airport terminal. Excellent size rooms. Limited choice of evening meal
5198,Mandy,2021-12-09,"Very convenient for airport. Proximity to airport and airport bus terminal. Very clean, quiet, great beds and bathroom. Breakfast could be of a higher quality - orange juice was like squash, croissants a bit dry, etc."
5199,Duncan,2021-12-09,Convenient and comfortable for flights into and out from Bristol. Efficient check in and out. Good breakfast. Convenient location.
5200,Shalaby,2021-12-09,Superb The locality Expensive

5203,Marilyn,2021-12-08,"Good value airport hotel, better then we thought it would be Great position on airport, very friendly staff, good sized clean room and good value, good choice for breakfast Nothing all ok"
5204,Michael,2021-12-08,"Nice hotel ruined by terrible food Room was nice and the bar was ok Food choice was appalling, what they made came out of a fryer or microwave, not befitting anything that calls itself a hotel"
5205,Terrance,2021-12-08,will definately stay again good beds very clean Packed breakfast for 6.00am departures would have been good
5206,Rhian,2021-12-06,"Would definitely recommend. The room was lovely, modern and very clean. Beds comfortable. Large walk in shower too which was great! Location was amazing. Airport a 5 min walk away. The front of desk was lovely as well. He made us feel very welcome. The food. Ordered a jacket potato it was brown 🤢 my sister ordered a tuna sandwich and the bread was stale. Needs improving."
5207,Catherine,2021-12-06,"very convenient as close to the airport but overpriced rooms closeness to the airport, staff very helpful breakfast available from 4am great for early flights food in restaurant not good value for money, was obviously microwaved pre packaged food. Room nothing special for the money charged beds very hard"
5208,Kevin,2021-12-05,Nice but expensive The location is superb and the rooms are excellent Over 200 pounds for one night
5209,Ian,2021-12-05,The hotel is convenient for the terminal and that is reflected in the room rates. Given that a lot of guests were taking early flights the start of service should be earlier. The continental offer was average. My comments are influenced by one member of staff who was taking food and beverage orders. I was queuing behind a customer waiting to be served when she came to the counter ignored me and served the person behind me while I was still waiting. That was rude and doesn’t go down well with us Brits.
5210,Caroline,2021-12-05,Superb Location was the key factor
5211,Simon,2021-12-05,it’s an airport hotel - efficient and soulless  I know it’s in the airport but it’s still a lot of money for a room in the Bristol area
5212,Ian,2021-12-04,would stay again if using the airport close to the airport a free beer on arrival would have been nice
5213,Sarah,2021-12-04,good experience Would stay again before an early /late flight location

5217,Julie,2021-12-02,Very good Proximity of the Airport. Breakfast. Hotel food was of poor quality.
5218,Julie,2021-12-02,Overnight Airport Stay This was an overnight stay at an airport hotel. It was comfortable and close to the airport. We also got a later check out which was much appreciated. Self service breakfast was excellent. The food menu was limited the chilli I had lacked meat and taste.
5219,Peter,2021-12-01,A comfortable stay in an ideal location for an early flight. It is a shame you cannot get better food options. It is very convenient for an early flight. Food options are limited.
5220,Philip,2021-12-01,Very good as always Close to the airport - comfortable rooms. Dinner menu sparse
5221,Paul,2021-12-01,Superb Very nice
5222,Clive,2021-12-01,"Great food, lovely people, lumpy, noisy mattress. Evening meal and breakfast was hot and good quality. Chelsea was great looked after us wonderfully. It Was without doubt the worst bed I have ever slept in..the mattress was at least 50 years old.. which was strange for a new hotel. And one pillow each on the bed... really whats that about."
5223,Rosamund,2021-11-29,convenient location but seriously consider eating elsewhere excellent location for the airport particularly when you have an early flight. comfortable and quiet room & very clean. the evening menu choices are very limited. it completely lets the hotel down. The menu is not in keeping with the quality of the accommodation. For some it is the beginning of a holiday & a good meal would be a great way to start.
5224,Hazel,2021-11-29,Overall a positive experience. Breakfast was expected and good. The hotel very modern. The walk from airport arrivals lounge to the hotel late at night was dimly lit. I will be writing to the airport authorities re this. The walk ways need weatherproofing ie; covered against the rain. I will be writing to the airport authorities re this! Arrived very late due to flight delays.
5225,John,2021-11-29,"Very good Clean, modern, well located Food is poor"

5230,Alan,2021-11-28,"We’ve stayed here a few times and enjoyed it I’d recommend it and I’ll definitely stay here again. Lovely hotel nice room good service from the checking in,staff very helpful we had early flight so missed the cooked breakfast but still plenty of choices with the continental choice,it’s so convenient with airport just across the road. nothing to say about it ,"

5232,Andrew,2021-11-27,"Very convenient and very comfortable Staff really friendly on arrival and both my 'special requests' had been catered for. An excellent breakfast (though the scrambled egg is powdered, I think). All in all a very satisfactory stay"
5233,Jennifer,2021-11-27,"It is the best airport hotel I have stayed in. Within a few minutes walk from the airport, it is clean, comfortable, with very pleasant and helpful staff. A cold breakfast begins at 4am, which is very good. the hot breakfast begins at 6am. The room is designed to maximise the space, is clean and comfortable. It is the best airport hotel I have stayed in. Nothing."
5234,Peter,2021-11-25,"Convenient and comfortable Would have liked to have seen an opportunity to have a take away arrangement as we had an early flight and left the hotel at 05.00 am. Your dining experience needs to improve, the menu is always the same and not very exciting and of a mediocre quality."
5235,Karen,2021-11-24,"Great stopover to make our holiday journey easier Close to airport , excellent breakfast and late 11am checkout nothing"
5236,Glenville,2021-11-24,Superb Excellent location and good breakfast. I was charged over £40 to park my car for the night. That was a nasty surprise.

5238,Jan,2021-11-23,"A great rest before the trip. Cosmetics with a beautiful scent, a very useful safe in the room, and the beds are very comfortable, other equipment very useful. Perfect location. The breakfast was very sparse, a small selection of cold cuts and breads and the shower water could have been a little warmer,"
5239,Martin,2021-11-23,"Staff, room and breakfast excellent but let down by the charges pending still remain Excellent Breakfast. Everything you'd want from a cooked breakfast The amount from the previous week was showing even though it was claimed by the 15th. After the stay on the 20th November 3 amounts were still showing pending. The charge was £112 which has been claimed but 2 pending items remain. Not good enough 3 days after the stay."

5245,Gloria,2021-11-19,"It is so convenient. My Meal was excellent. I chose Chicken Jalfrezi and had a portion of chips & a glass of wine. It arrived quickly and was piping hot and immaculately served. Thank you. I am elderly and have stayed here several times as it means I can easily walk to the airport after a longish train journey, from Cornwall, then a bus trip from Temple Meads Station and it makes my life easier. I prefer to have a room with a bath, otherwise it was warm clean and comfortable. All the staff were lovely. To have a room with a bath and shower head."

5256,Gillian,2021-11-14,Highly recommend Breakfast was great. Shower was excellent too. Staying so close to airport I expected noise but it was so peaceful Not enough pillows in room
5257,Kathleen,2021-11-14,Overall it was ok the location was excellent as was the Continental breakfast. Incredibly quiet. The staff were very welcoming and helpful at all times The only thing I was disappointed in there were no teabags in the room and I felt it was too late 10pm to ask staff plus I was tired but I was so looking forward to a cup of tea - small things but important at the time! Also the bins had not been emptied. When showering in the morning the water was not draining away in the tray and had to turn it off!! Room 157

5266,Tag,2021-11-11,Exactly what you want from an airport hotel. The exorbitant parking charge is the negative  The parking charge is extortionate.
5267,Jacqueline,2021-11-10,"Very good location was excellent for the airport. very clean and comfortable. a decent breakfast selection, The dinner restaurant meals were very poor, on both occasions. Staff very friendly."
5268,Richard,2021-11-09,Very good Only stayed because of proximity to airport. It was good to have continental breakfast available from 4am and to be able to pack a breakfast and take it with you. All the staff were friendly and helpful.

5272,Janet,2021-11-08,"Would use the facility whenever flying from Bristol Airport, even if only for a coffee or snack. The proximity to the Bus Park and to the Airport. The friendlness of the staff and the superb response to our request for an additional duvet and pillow each on our arrival in the cold night on return from Tenerife, all this at about 1 am. Much appreciated. The sudden closure of the breakfast area doors without notice. We understood breakfast was from 7 till 11 but didn't expect that!"

5276,Emma,2021-11-07,"Short but sweet stay will be back. Great hotel in a very convenient location for weary travellers using the airport. Well designed, beautifully clean with all the elements needed for a restful stay. Staff were very friendly and helpful with a genuine will to want to give great customer service. My check in was the best I’ve ever had in a hotel. We had to check out at 4am so was disappointed that takeaway breakfast was not available. A take away coffee would have been very welcome! If I’m unable to have time to enjoy breakfast I should be offered a reduction in rate or a takeaway."
5277,Rita,2021-11-06,"Superb  Pillows were not comfortable.., too flat"
5278,Pauline,2021-11-06,airport hotel easy access to Bristol airport. the staff were very friendly and helpful. very comfortable and well appointed room also very very clean. Breakfast available from 4am which for early travellers is a bonus. would definitely stay here again. nothing to dislike
5279,Graham,2021-11-05,Good airport stopover. Clean and convenient to the airport. Very limited menu at the moment.

5282,Andy,2021-11-03,Quick pit stop Comfy room and good breakfast -
5283,Keith,2021-11-03,Good needed more pillows the two pillows on the bed had less depth than a folded towel. whilst I realise I could have asked for more at midnight when your in bed it’s not ideal to get dressed and go and ask reception. the bathroom fan was humming all night and the shower did not drain properly. we had to wait 10 mins for the shower tray to empty before my husband could shower for fear of flooding the room .
5284,Tracey,2021-11-02,Superb ideal for a stop over before a flight. Lovely spacious rooms and a good breakfast
5285,Michael,2021-11-02,"great property, room and staff, very poor breakfast  The hotel and staff were 4 star, but unfortunately the breakfast was 1 star. Such a shame as everything else was fantastic and the staff were outstanding"
5286,Linda,2021-11-02,"Good, will return The hotel was very clean, emphasis on Covid precautions. Staff friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent, lots of choice in both drinks and food. Superb location for the air terminal. A hairdryer in the room and a little more space between bed and wall as there's only about a foot."
5287,Marcus,2021-11-02,Very good Good that it’s available from 04:00 for early departing flights
5288,Richard,2021-11-02,Over night stay Very close to get to the airport You had to walk outside in the rain to get to the airport and contend with stairs while carrying your cases
5289,Hem,2021-11-02,"Clean the pipes! No noise, nice and quiet. The floor of the shower cubicle got filled very quickly with water, and despite turning up the temperature for hot water it didn’t budge at all. Shame, as it could have been a better experience."
5290,Daniel,2021-11-01,Very good  takeaway breakfast was awful!!
5291,David,2021-11-01,Very good right next to the airport 3min walk
5292,Abi,2021-11-01,Very good Perfect location if you have an early flight. Only got one pillow each and they were very soft so it was basically like laying your head directly on the mattress.
5293,Graham,2021-11-01,"first stay location the choice of breakfast was fantastic, everything you could want, unfortunately the hot cooked selection was cold and inedible"
5294,Denise,2021-10-31,Good clean hotel near ti Airport Bedrooms were spacious and comfortable clean Food menu was Ltd and has you are out if the way nowhere else to eat so could be a little more variety
5295,Margaret,2021-10-29,perfect for the airport clean and comfortable lack of proper direction in bar and eating area
5296,Ian,2021-10-29,"Great location close to terminal food choice is just not good enough, nice to have a good meal before departure, stayed here many times for early morning flight but food always an issue. Breakfast is good. full cover walkway and better signage, too many steps or 150meter ramp."
5297,Leanne,2021-10-28,Very good  We arrived at 1.40am and were given the furthest room from the lift on the 2nd floor even though there were many available.
5298,Roderic,2021-10-28,Very good near airport and car park
5299,Keith,2021-10-28,ok The room The food had a pizza 🍕 not good luke warm cappocina coffee 🍵 warm I sat there for 1 hour few tables were left not cleared staff were there did not clear tables not a good look

Convenient to airport. Excellent reception on arrival. Comfiest bed ever! Super clean. Lovely shower. Lovely products in bathroom."
5302,Julie,2021-10-27,Hampton by Hilton Great facilities and very clean. Good choice of food at the restaurant and great value for money. We didn’t receive our 4am wake up call!!
5303,Anne,2021-10-27,"Good Doors are sealed after cleaning, , tv remote cleaned, then it is put in a wrapper, Bed, duvet and pillows comfortable, I stayed in the hotel two years ago , the same weekend and the price was 45 pounds more expensive, I thought the price a bit expensive. I understand about the increase in cost of cleaning and difficulty in getting staff, but since I had a 6am flight I did not really have any choice, as there are also less flights to choose from."
5304,Iestyn,2021-10-26,Plupla yn hedfan short walk to terminal quiet at night food is ok - not too exciting! price is ok - captive audience pushes it up a bit

5315,Michael,2021-10-20,Very good Proximity to airport departures. Little parking on site.
5316,Pamela,2021-10-20,"A most convenient hotel for a short stop-over. Good choice of breakfast and bar meals and comfortable, clean room. So easy to get to/from airport. I arrived early evening, in pouring rain to find the room chilly. I would have appreciated walking into a warm bedroom."
5317,Bernard,2021-10-20,"Overall very pleasant would recommend Room was good, Very near the AIRPORT which was good for me as I am disabled. Breakfast was late on the hotplate. Breakfast was late to the hotplate."
5318,Sandra,2021-10-19,pre flight stay close to airport usual Hilton standard lively rooms limited bar menu lots of things off menu. Poor staff were run off their feet. 1 new staff member for a busy hotel bar. poor man
5319,Scott,2021-10-18,"Overnight stay. clean, tidy, quiet and great location for terminal."
5320,Robert,2021-10-18,"It served my purpose nicely for a great nights sleep, and a hearty breakfast after a long travel. Room clean and comfy, very nice gym also. Breakfast very good. Tables needed cleaning in restaraunt area and plates not cleared away - small issue but important."
5321,Debra,2021-10-17,"Perfect overnight stay for early morning flight! Proximity to airport,clean and comfortable with helpful but not overbearing staff Early (4 am )continental tasty breakfast included which was appreciated! Evening meal was also tasty….we had curry and nachos…great start to our holiday! Quite expensive"
5322,Carr,2021-10-17,Good  Bedroom comfort not great and very noisy
5323,Gary,2021-10-17,"Comfortable stay after a late flight arrival. Location at Bristol Airport is great. Rooms are comfortable, easy check in and an all night bar. Good breakfast. Excellent, friendly and helpful staff. Maybe just a tad pricey."
5324,Spencer,2021-10-17,Good  Menu is very basic and our meals was advertised with potatoes wedges but arrived with chips no explanation given.
5325,Duncan,2021-10-16,We like the functionality of design and service: it's just right for a before and after flight stay. Check in easy and that's what was needed at 2300 after along tiring day. Male member of staff friendly and sensitive to our exhaustion! Room clean and bed comfortable. Shower and towels excellent. Breakfast varied and welcome. Two pillows rather than one. Too late at night for us to feel like requesting this though on our next stay we shall do this in advance.
5326,Rona,2021-10-16,Perfect place to crash after a late landing flight Great location. Very good breakfast choice Room was bit small & hot
5327,Simon,2021-10-16,Superb  my food for the evening was heated up in a microwave half was cold and half was warm they changed and warmed it up but this kinda stuff should not happen.
5328,Barbara,2021-10-16,"A good location Friendly staff, a good breakfast and comfortable beds. Small rooms"
5329,Christine,2021-10-15,"Reassuringly safe, clean and comfortable Excellent facilities just a short walk from the Airport and the bus station. Everything was very well equipped, superbly comfortably and super Covid clean. I felt very safe there as a senior solo female. A bit pricey, but almost totally worth it for the convenience."
5330,Peter,2021-10-14,"Excellent position for an early flight The location alone is worth the price. This trip the breakfast exceed my expectations, you don't expect cooked at 4 in the morning and the choice of meat cheese and fruit was an improvement on my last trip. All the staff in interacted with were 100% except the guy at check out, he was 110% when I'd forgotten my jacket in the room, he looked after my bags without fuss, well done I didn't like having to order food from the bar, last time my order was taken at the table (because of COVID-19) it was not busy and could have been accommodated. This meant I had to carry my belongings rather than leave them on the table. The bathroom is excellent but unfortunately this time there was a bad sludge arould the seal of the shower tray, had I stayed more than one night I would have expected a change of room, given the price paid"
5331,Rhodes,2021-10-13,Very good Speed of check-in & out; practical Covid responses; good room layout Nothing - all was excellent
5332,Angela,2021-10-13,"Functional, convenient and clean Great staff. Preferable to driving from home for a 6am flight. Nothing"
5333,Malcolm,2021-10-13,Staff exceptionally helpful Good for 4.30am.
5334,Tina,2021-10-12,"Superb Proximity to the airport. Rooms were cleaned to a high standard. All the staff were polite & friendly Only the price, the same as any hotel so close to an airport"
5335,Scott,2021-10-12,trip away gym and food bathroom door and no swimming pool
5336,Jeremy,2021-10-12,Good value and position OK but too early for fried breakfast as left by 5am which was a shame Fried breakfast
5337,Carol,2021-10-12,"Very good Convenience to departure, helpful but overrun staff,"
5338,Rhianydd,2021-10-11,"Superb The bed was so comfortable we extended our check out time! We arrived late at night after a very long flight so tried to order a pizza which was advertised as a 24 hour product. We were told We had to go down to reception to order, and there were only cold sandwiches available. Not a massive deal but not as advertised either."
5339,Olly,2021-10-09,Very good Varied options. Good coffee. Practical self service.
5340,Phil,2021-10-09,"It was convenient, handy - an overall OK stay but couple of minor issues meant it wasn't excellent Walking distance from the terminal. Late night check-in was easy. Receptionist was very friendly and welcoming. We could get a drink in the bar even though it was late. Bathroom had a strange smell on first entering. May have been from lack of use or cleaning products. It was gone by morning. Breakfast was a little disappointing - though there was a good variety, what I had lacked in flavour. For the price of the room I expected an excellent breakfast."
5341,Oopsididitagain,2021-10-08,"Airport overnight stay Spacious room, very clean, very close to the airport, food & drinks available, comfy bed I wish there’s a bath tub available in the room. The room cost is quite high, I think it should have been less than 90 quid, maybe at least 75 quids."
5342,Alan,2021-10-08,"Perfectly functional for airport hotel Clean room, easy check in Queueing for a drink in the evening! Had 2 drinks had total time 40 mins waiting."
5343,Richard,2021-10-07,Very good Location for early flight Too few staff leading to queues for check in and the bar. Very nice staff despite the pressure
5344,Mark,2021-10-07,"Very good Locality to airport, Lots of steps and ramps to get to departures"
5345,Ann,2021-10-06,Superb Location. Complimentary breakfast from 4:00am. Great staff.
5346,Michelle,2021-10-06,"Exactly what was needed Super easy check in by helpful staff, again when we checked out. Lovely clean room. Nice breakfast External signage and lighting. Could be better signposted, but if they had all the lights on it would have been easier to spot"
5347,Emma,2021-10-06,Good overnighted for airport Reception staff very helpful. Best thing is parking your car and then knowing you just have to walk 2 mins in morning to airport. Food menu pretty basic but food good.
5348,Terry,2021-10-06,"Good, but could have been better.  Reception could not find our original booking!!,and told us that we were lucky to get a room as the hotel was full. This was pretty stressful at the time. Also, despite notifying the hotel of our earlier than check in arrival time, we could not use the gym"
5349,Roger,2021-10-05,Very good Breakfast was cold (cooked breakfast). Warmer cooked breakfast.
5350,Jan,2021-10-05,Perfect location. Will use again for an early flight We book because of the location. Flight too early for breakfast Expensive
5351,Glyn,2021-10-05,Superb  Bed uncomfortable
5352,Ioana,2021-10-05,"Good The position is key here, given the lack of competition so close to the airport. The hotel is not yet old, and there is a certain brand standard that is nice to be able to rely on. Fabulous beds, nice shower and always good to have a powerful hairdryer available. The dinner was super-decent and not expensive, the WiFi signal strong and reliable for my needs, even for live streaming. Staff were generally very nice and helpful. There was something to eat even at 4am, which was helpful. A bit of maintenance is already needed; in my room none of the power outlets by the bed worked; I was lucky that the cables I had with me were long enough to use the ones by the desk. Rather disappointingly none of my calls to the front desk were answered."
5353,Smith,2021-10-05,Good pre-departure airport stay Works well as an airport hotel for pre-flight. It's also great that the breakfast is available very early in the morning The food offer is basic & could be improved
5354,Caryn,2021-10-04,"Very convenient for catching flights from the airport We didn't have time for breakfast due to early morning flight although we were able to take some muffins and pastries with us to the airport as some food available at 4.00am There wasn't anything we didn't like, although next time we come it would be good if there was more evening meal selections"
5355,Richard,2021-10-04,Smart well appointed Hotel ideal if you are using Bristol Airport Position near to Airport buildings Early breakfast Excellent Guest Room Nothing
5356,Peter,2021-10-03,"Convenient for airport - a good choice if travelling early morning. The location - near the airport and car parks. Clean and tidy, though quite basic, room. Everything worked fine. The staff were very helpful. It will be our hotel of choice when using Bristol airport. Shame a covered walkway couldn't have been designed in to reach the terminal. Expected a bit more in the way of food - limited choice. Expected more for the price paid. Had the feel of a budget hotel."
5357,Emma,2021-10-03,Very good Location brilliant breakfast selection good Price was cheaper after I.had booked
5358,Michelle,2021-09-30,Good Very clean and comfortable Close to airport
5359,Lloyd,2021-09-30,Very convenient after a late flight Very convenient for Bristol airport Nothing
5360,Mark,2021-09-30,"NICE AND QUIET WOULD STAY AGAIN SHOULD THE OCCASSION ARRIVE, BUT MAYBE A LITTLE PRICEY AT £157. EVENING MEAL OF A CURRY WAS VERY NICE, BREAKFAST WAS FANTASTIC ABSOLUTLY NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT AND 100 YARDS FROM THE AIRPORT. METAL BED FRAME WAS A BIT NOISY. TV DID ON OCCASION FREEZE"
5361,Kevin,2021-09-30,Superb For Airport best location
5362,Kevin,2021-09-29,"A bit expensive but.... Location is perfect for the airport terminal....accommodation is modern,functional,clean and well staffed Nothing"
5363,Peter,2021-09-28,Good start and end to our flights Good price on the simple meals available Price of a glass of wine well over the top
5364,Kathryn,2021-09-27,"A typical airport hotel where you are there of one night only. Most things were to my satisfaction. Everything was as it should be, the room clean and tidy. The Receptionists were very helpful with instructing me to collect a trolley, and then they stored it, for me, in the Luggage Room, to assist with my baggage and early morning 4am start. There is a ramp up to the airport that made pushing a laden trolley much easier. I thought the menu was very poor, giving an extremely limited choice. If you liked any type of burger you were catered for! I plumped for Cream of Tomato Soup - out of a tin - and a baked potato with a chilli con carne filling. (they wouldn't need a chef to rustle that up) I was expecting Dinner! - Nope! Also, there was a horrible B.O. odour in the room, on arrival."
5365,Claire,2021-09-27,Good Good chouse It was quite cold by the time I got back to my table
5366,Nick,2021-09-26,"Perfect for airport travel Beautifully clean, comfortable beds and friendly staff Had to jump to get onto the toilet"
5367,June,2021-09-26,"Very good Room was excellent, staff very friendly Didn’t have breakfast as flight was really early. Dinner was disappointing but this could have been due to the current situation."
5368,Rebecca,2021-09-25,"Very good Restaurant open until 22.00, good food."
5369,Lesley,2021-09-25,"Lovely quiet modern hotel Room spacious, comfortable, clean, modern and quiet. Breakfast-time was relaxed with plentiful choice. Staff friendly and helpful. Parking readily available in hotel car park. My partner found the pillow too thin and unsupportive, and there weren't any more in the room. I would have liked to have seen a few more interesting items on the menu."
5370,Pamela,2021-09-24,A perfectly good place to stay. Perfectly placed for the airport. Crisp clean bedroom. Light breakfast available for an early get away I understand why the checking in & out process is virtually contact less but I miss the human touch.
5371,Vicki,2021-09-24,relaxing all service was good nothing
5372,Mark,2021-09-24,"Very good The location of the hotel is perfect if you arrive late at the airport (or if you have an early flight). The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The breakfast is very much ‘off the production line’, with the fruit out of tins. It is okay but nowhere near the best we have had at a hotel."
5373,Helena,2021-09-24,Superb Amazing location if you have an early flight. Super clean and comfortable.
5374,Angela,2021-09-24,"Very enjoyable stay after a holiday. As a vegetarian good choice cooked breakfast, good selection to eat and drink. Only thing was no extra pillows in room got in bed and pillows bit flat."
5375,Matthew,2021-09-23,"Highly recommended for early departures and late arrivals Always reliable hotel, great for late arrivals or early departures. The rooms are beautifully appointed and quiet, soundproofing must be good. The staff are friendly and helpful. My wife had to make a trip into Bristol in the morning (losing our spot in the long stay which doesn’t allow reentry) but the hotel were happy for her to park in the hotel car park when she got back, which was very much appreciated. There was a technical problem between the booking.com and Hilton systems which meant that we were initially overcharged for our room, but the front desk were very helpful in sorting it out and fully refunding the difference. It would be great to have some kind of rapid checkin for late flight arrivals as everyone arrives at once and is so tired."
5376,Anthony,2021-09-23,Good  Breakfast cold at 7am very poor
5377,Frances,2021-09-23,"Very good Comfy room, lovely breakfast, cleanliness and a great proximity to the Terminal in the airport. For some reason we only had one pillow each. Reception did not answer the phone on many occasions for me to request two more. Had to trudge down to Reception as they did not answer and ask for pillows. Reception was manned by two people who were ignoring the telephone. That was not good."
5378,Kawasakiqueen,2021-09-23,"Superb The selection and choice at breakfast was exceptional, something for everyone, The room was very clean, spacious, and comfortable, The staff on hand were very friendly and welcoming access to the hotel from the airport terminal isnt great with heavy suitcases due to the amount of stairs, and the acccess ramps taking you so far away"
5379,Carol,2021-09-23,Superb All the rest was OK Found it very difficult to get from hotel to airport as had to carry case up steps very hard for my age 78yrs on my own. Plus my daughter took me and it was £5 just to drop me off.
5380,Jan,2021-09-22,Good Clean quiet great location Early morning breakfast very basic - could have better choice pastries fruit etc
5381,Nicolette,2021-09-22,"Excellent location and helpful staff, really clean rooms Perfect 👍"
5382,Cheershouse,2021-09-22,"Fabulous for a quick stay at the airport Good standard clean and comfortable rooms Very limited menu, if you're staying more than one night it is difficult to find something different to eat on the second night"
5383,Nicola,2021-09-21,Good location and large room Way too expensive No breakfast has left at 03:45 and nothing offered instead (paid B&B rate) Had to pay for parking on the night of our stay System to order dinner was ridiculous Small evening meal menu
5384,Euan,2021-09-21,Ideal place to stay right at the airport. Fantastic location to airport. Decent food. Very clean room. Perfect for an overnight. I'd have liked to be able to get room service.
5385,Kala,2021-09-21,Superb Friendly and professional Staff Poor basic Breakfast
5386,Louise,2021-09-19,"Clean and easy for the family Free Internet use and printing facilities, which we used for our Spanish locator forms last minute which was a god send Rooms quite small"

5394,Kevin,2021-09-17,Really hate surveys! Great welcome and attention Room was a little cramped ! Less furniture would give more room around the bed.
5395,Cilla,2021-09-16,Good Closeness to airport Pillows Poor choice of menu in restaurant
5396,Derek,2021-09-16,"The stay was fine and suited our purposes very well. Breakfast was and lunch. Staff were very helpful especially the day time reception staff, couldn't have asked for anything more."
5397,Jane,2021-09-16,Flying out early meant we needed to find something the night before and this was perfect. Everything was good. I had tried to use my Hilton Points but couldn’t get anything sorted. Nothing

5401,Robert,2021-09-14,"Good Comfortable room, easy access to the airport tetminal The restaurant - limited memu and food badly cooked. Having to pay car parking for dropping off less than 5 minutes."
5402,Sherrie,2021-09-14,Great for an early flight. The location was perfect and the hotel was very clean and the staff were lovely. Food on offer done on a canteen basis which I didn’t like. Limited menu.
5403,Francine,2021-09-13,"Pleasant The hotel was extremely well located for Bristol Airport. Very clean and modern but perhaps lacking a little soul but I think that might be due to the covid restrictions. The staff were helpful and charming but there was not many of them….overall a pleasant experience and I would recommend it to anyone travelling….it was not cheap but it was very clean and everything worked more or less Soulless atmosphere, air conditioning broke down during the night setting off a hideous alarm"
5404,Natalija,2021-09-13,"Very clean and peaceful 2 minutes walk from terminal. Lovely clean room with good use of space. Absolutely silent, no noise factor at all. I slept very well. I also thought the staff were good and the breakfast was generous- you can eat the buffet breakfast and take coffee and food away in a paper bag for later. The hotel was fairly quiet which is good as I hate having breakfast in busy dining rooms. I think the price is a little expensive compared to similar standard hotels but it is the only real airport hotel in Bristol."
5405,Linda,2021-09-13,Great Airport hotek As Airport hotels go this is 1 of the best Excellent breakfast with great choices and meal of the day super value Nothing

5412,Teri,2021-09-07,"Overnight Airport Stay Excellent position with short walk to terminal. Room was clean, comfortable and great shower! Staff were very helpful and seamless process to book in and out. Evening meal/Burger was excellent. No outside area to enjoy a drink with tables and chairs just a smoking bench to front and rear. Breakfast was barely warm, no choice of eggs, only scrambled."
5413,Darren,2021-09-07,Superb Sofa bed rock hard. You can hurt yourself on all the exposed metal.
5414,Ben,2021-09-06,Lovely stop off The facilities were amazing for travellers who need a overnight stop off between flights. There is nothing we didn’t like about the property.
5415,Ellen,2021-09-06,Very good Close to airport very convenient and good quality hotel Nothing
5416,Margaret,2021-09-05,Perfect for a one night stop over! Breakfast was just average! Location perfect after a late flight! More fresh fruit and berries for breakfast and scrambled egg that was yellow in colour not cream! and wasn’t sitting on a hot plate for hours!!! Fresh baked bread would have been nice!
5417,Aidan,2021-09-05,"Very good Location, close to airport A little bit far out of town"
5418,Christine,2021-09-04,Great location We ate at 4am so Limited continental...not great to.be honest No fresh fruit apart from dome sad looking satsumas and bananas No peanut butter..cream cheese.. bagels Only.one pillow on bed No.one answered phone Had to.go.to reception
5419,Marta,2021-09-04,Good  The breakfast could be improved
5420,Dorothy,2021-09-03,Fine for the night and great for airport Just had continental take away which was fine. Room was said to be queen but bed a king? More towel rails needed! Bathroom needed more towels rails and two pillows would have been good.
5421,Amanda,2021-09-03,Great airport stay Always spotless and easy to use Nothing
5422,Shirley,2021-09-01,Clean and comfortable Room and bed and cleanliness Pre early flight stay No room service
5423,Sara,2021-09-01,Very good excleent rooms check n covid precautions Poor choice of cereals and fruit at breakfast rest of breakfast very good not as good as a premier inn breakfast though
5424,Chriscal18,2021-09-01,"Becoming our regular pre flight accommodation. Close to the airport Food a bit pricey , but expected for an airport hotel."
5425,Peter,2021-08-30,"Convenient but not wholly pleasant. Very convenient for the airport. I ticked the box for a quiet room on the top floor, but was told that only two floors were in use. I would swear that there was someone in the room above me and it was not particularly quiet."
5426,Helen,2021-08-30,"Very pleasant stay but disappointed about lack of breakfast. The location was perfect and so was the room, very comfortable bed. We didn't manage to have breakfast as it was not available early enough. Most disappointing. We were on a 6am flight, but so must a lot of other guests be as there are a lot of flights at that time, so it would be great to be able to get breakfast earlier."
5427,Nicola,2021-08-30,Good Near departures and parking Had to wait for room…. At £200 + I expected something amazing !
5428,Gerald,2021-08-29,"Excellent room, staff and breakfast Breakfast was excellent standard and choice. Room was of a high standard and bed was exceptionally comfortable. Staff very friendly, professional and very helpful. The time it took for reception to answer the phone. We had to chase our evening meal order ordered. We waited 40 minutes for a call to say it was ready for collection. Our order had been forgotten so we had to wait for it to be prepared. Staff were very apologetic. Food was good, worth waiting for!"
5429,Natasha,2021-08-29,"Exactly what you need Exactly what you need when your flight is at 6am. Right next to airport, early breakfast, comfy beds. Restaurant could be a bit more varied and better quality."
5430,Po,2021-08-29,We arrived at 10pm so only lukewarm water for our shower Breakfast included; close to airport bus A1
5431,Kevin,2021-08-29,Friendly efficient staff Clean .. spacious .. clean rooms .. comfortable beds ..
5432,Patricia,2021-08-29,Superb It was a perfect start to our trip and made for an easy departure for our early flight the next day.
5433,Fleur,2021-08-28,Superb Room Portion at supper a rather small.
5434,Robert,2021-08-26,Very good The accommodation was good The evening meal and breakfast were terrible
5435,Rosamond,2021-08-25,"I was happy with the facilities, very close to the airport. We did not have time to enjoy breakfast but picked up some porridge on the way to the flight."
5436,Boyd,2021-08-24,Good quality hotel Staff very friendly and extremely helpful Evening food was very limited in choice and in my opinion not the best quality. Not what you'd expect for this type of hotel
5437,Martyndurran,2021-08-23,"Needs must  Typical Hilton, no soul"
5438,Helen,2021-08-22,"Very good Very friendly staff, a really easy and quick check-in and check-out. Great breakfast! It would be nice to have 2 pillows per bed as a standard."
5439,Ben,2021-08-22,"Good The hotel was clean and modern, got a gym on sight and a bar also. And the rooms was clean and welcoming. The hotel is really nice, could recommend people to stay. The TV wasn't picking up any channels in my room when staying. It was a fair amount of money for my stay for 2 nights plus the £8 per night parking. Ideal for flying out, but when staying in the area, it was a lot of money. Also the selection menu for dinner was limited, not a lot to choose either."
5440,Sneddon-hinojosa,2021-08-22,"Excellent location, clean room, and overall good value for money. Hotel was very convenient for the airport, room was very clean, breakfast was extensive with plenty of choice. Room decor was a little sterile; would have been nice to have a couple of additional pillows."
5441,Amanda,2021-08-21,"Brilliant extra helpful staff went over and above Staff, location Just wish we’d known the kingdom stay carpark was so near and we could have just parked there and give straight to departures in the morning"
5442,Richard,2021-08-21,"Can't wait to return to this hotel. Location is good. Staff are welcoming and very friendly. Rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. I have stayed here before and look forward to returning. Absolutely nothing."
5443,William,2021-08-21,Good Used a few times before so location great along with facilities Spacious clean room Great after red eye flight Breakfast is average with varied food temperature from buffet and powdered scrambled egg Extortionate price due to pandemic supply and demand
5444,Hayley,2021-08-18,"Very good Great location as only a few minutes walk to the airport. The staff are very friendly, especially the check in staff. The breakfast started very early, which worked well for us with an early flight. Great selection too! I thought the hotel was quite expensive and the dinner menu was very limited, especially for vegetarians."
5445,Joey,2021-08-17,"Excellent location but no connecting room The location next to Bristol airport (but not physically linked to it) is brilliant in particular for the weary traveler on an early morning flight. Very clean, new, functional rooms. On check-in requested two connecting rooms and was offered two rooms in the same corridor - only to find that one was a connecting room with nobody yet checked-in on the other side (the covid seal on the other door was intact). Despite this well worth it."
5446,Catherine,2021-08-17,"Ireland eve I loved this hotel, the staff were lovely and the hotel itself was lovely and clean and comfy . The only thing I can fault with this hotel was the shower. I looked forward to the shower as again was lovely and clean. However, as soon as I stepped In the floor was so slippery I went straight on my back and bruised my arm and my back badly. For me the floor is way too slippery and I nearly fell over in it again."
5447,Darren,2021-08-17,"Super convenient. We always stay here when we have an early flight the next day. We have a couple of drinks in the bar before going to bed, which is nice, We always sleep well and it saves us getting up in the middle of the night if we were to travel to the airport on the same day. Bar staff could have been a bit more efficient, but its a minor gripe."
5448,Simon,2021-08-16,Very good Clean comfortable and quiet room. Very convenient for my purpose Although breakfast included it was of v low quality
5449,Robert,2021-08-16,Very good Staff were helpful and accommodation met expectations and was clean. No issues so perfect. Clean and tidy with helpful staff
5450,Mayumi,2021-08-16,"Cool interior design excellent hotel Room was clean. Bedding quality was high. Interior design in Hampton was excellent. Gym was very useful. Although I didn't use laptop safe, I think it is useful. Communal area was very clean and nicely colour coordinated. Shower tiles were very small. They are very nice in design wise when they are new. But as it gets older, grouting gets dirty easy. I wish we have fridge in room."
5451,Geeta,2021-08-15,"Good Cleanliness, smiley staff Evening cafe food was atrocious! Overpriced!"
5452,Nicola,2021-08-15,"Easy hasselt free stay. Quick check in, parking tickets dealt with quickly. Never enough milk for me in the room, bar menu minimal and not great food."
5453,Kate,2021-08-15,"Welcome rest stop minutes walk from the airport This was a quick convenience after a late night flight. Check in was fast and while the room was nothing special it was clean, comfortable and a welcome rest. We were in an accessible room which for those requiring supportive bathroom furniture, I would recommend these rooms as these are really well equipped."
5454,Sarah,2021-08-15,"Superb Breakfast- fantastic! Early check in- thank you! Helpful staff Bed was a bit hard for sleeping! Sorry, comfortable but a very firm mattress which my back didn’t like!"
5455,Julie,2021-08-14,Very good Clean and comfortable Close to terminal Reception very friendly and efficient Pizza not as good as previously Bar staff not so friendly
5456,Patricia,2021-08-13,Excellent but marred by the above. We were able to pick up a grab breakfast for a 7 a.m. flight. The room was good and we were comfortable. The food we had for dinner wasn’t brilliant. We got a fine for going into the car park at the airport the wrong way. We are pensioners and I had asked if we could park at the hotel if we paid in advance as we have disabilities. We got a fine for stopping at a line and it’s not fair.
5457,Teresa,2021-08-13,Superb Buffet breakfast was available from 4am - fantastic for those of us with crack of dawn flights. Doggy bags available for those with no time to sit down. Restaurant open for dinner until 10pm - simple food but good. Everything was great
5458,Eann,2021-08-13,Nice hotel Nice clean hotel in good location for airport. Room incredibly dark during the night. A very dim light would of been good in the bathroom.
5459,Keiran92,2021-08-13,Very good Location was spot on and staff very nice and food at hotel was excellent Lack of pillows and room very small for £155 per night
5460,Lisa,2021-08-12,Superb  Proximity to airport

5462,Sasha,2021-08-11,"Goodnight sleep, comfortable No breakfast early flight nothing"
5463,Jane,2021-08-11,Nice location for travel Location Nothing
5464,Sophie,2021-08-11,"Perfect for an airport hotel Very clean, excellent and very accommodating staff, comfortable and convenient for the airport. Highly recommend. No rooms have baths which makes it slightly inconvenient with little ones - not a dealbreaker though!"
5465,Sean,2021-08-11,Good LOCATION HAD TO BE IN THE AIRPORT AT 4.00AM BUT NO BREAKFAST PROVIDED
5466,Jose,2021-08-11,"Next to Airport, perfect for visiting Bristol and surroundings. Next to the airport, perfect for traveling around the area, excellent service. Rooms are very comfortable and breakfast is nice and abundant. Nothing to complain about but Be aware is 8 pounds extra per day for parking. Everything else was superb. If arriving late maybe worth not hiring a car the same day as the hotel is located meters away from the airport main entrance."
5467,John,2021-08-10,"Summer Holiday Clean, close to Airport, good food … Nothing to dislike"
5468,Florence,2021-08-10,Superb Me airport comfy and clean
5469,Chriscal18,2021-08-10,So easy for the airport. Extra lie in before flight time.
5470,Sharon,2021-08-10,Very good Beds very comfortable. Quiet and clean hotel. Lively staff. Limited menu and mainly pub like food.
5471,Alison,2021-08-08,The best airport hotel Always stay here before an early flight if it’s available. Can’t beat the location and helpful staff. The rooms are ideal and comfortable. The holiday starts upon checking in. Food variety and quality has deteriorated since my last visit.
5472,Stephen,2021-08-07,"Business trip Nice comfortable rooms, close to the airport It's difficult to rate due to operating during covid. So overall it was the best experience that could be offered under the circumstances. Well done to all !"
5473,Ian,2021-08-07,"Great place to stay for an early flight. Location is great, very helpful staff and very clean and confortable. The reataurant menu is very small and the choice not brilliant. Needs to improve. The price is high considering hotels are supposed to be desperate for customers........This is Bristol not Heathrow!"
5474,Eunan,2021-08-06,"Very good Hotel staff where very friendly and helpful, had an early flight so missed the breakfast. Location to the airport, perfect."
5475,James,2021-08-05,Superb Very clean and safe from Covid Nothing
5476,Sally,2021-08-05,"Ok Room was clean and comfortable, easy for airport and long stay parking The eating area was not cleaned to the standard I would expect of a Holton hotel"
5477,Jacqueline,2021-08-04,"Excellent location for Airport. Location excellent for airport. Extremely Clean, plenty of hand gel and antibacterial wipes available. The rooms, beds, towels and bathrooms were really good standard. Lovely reception and restaurant staff. The breakfast selection was very good. The bar food wasn’t particularly good. Both burger and chips were bone dry and the chips cold. I think the burgers were microwaved to oblivion. Breakfast scrambled eggs were of the egg powder type, which always taste like water, not like eggs."
5478,Jeffrey,2021-08-01,surperb everything nothing
5479,Julia,2021-08-01,Wouldn’t recommend food Bed very comfortable Last time I stayed at the hotel the evening meal was basic but good. Last night had the chicken burger … not recommended. Just because there is a pandemic please don’t dumb down the food.
5480,Richard,2021-07-30,Convenient base for people needing to use the airport. Large comfortable rooms
5481,Annie,2021-07-29,Very good Quick and Easy booking in
5482,Ian,2021-07-29,"A good modern hotel in a very useful location. Excellent location. Good facilities. Well provided and comfortable bedroom. The breakfast is OK but a bit 'standard' in comparison with others in the same price range. However, satisfactory within the price. Most of the beer pumps were off."
5483,Elsbeth,2021-07-28,"Great location for the airport We stayed here the night before our flight and it was perfect walking distance to the terminal. We had dinner in the restaurant, very small menu but could be that they were short staffed or Covid related. Room was clean however the bin hadn’t been emptied from the last people staying there. Small menu choices and dirty bins."
5484,Michael,2021-07-28,Adequate Breakfast options good - takeaway Felt it was expensive for what I’d a simple one night stay with a very early start
5485,Kirsty,2021-07-27,"Very good Clean and room was nice. Easy parking Food was nice Staff shortage, therefore waited nearly 30 minutes once seated for a drink. Staff did apologise."
5486,Stanley,2021-07-27,Superb The location.next to Bristol Airport. The bed.there was dip in the mattress.not good quality.
5487,Terry,2021-07-26,Enjoyed my stay and would use again  2 pillows but not a complaint
5488,Anna,2021-07-26,Very good Breakfast and cleanliness More choice on menu for evening mesl
5489,Keith,2021-07-24,As I stayed here before it meets my expectations My early flights to Gibraltar means I can never enjoy breakfast. The bathroom was a disability bathroom with a wet room which had a level that allowed water to leak onto the carpet at the entrance.
5490,Alice,2021-07-23,Very good Comfy and clean rooms - great for an early flight. Very helpful staff. Limited options in the restaurant.
5491,Helen,2021-07-23,"Excellent accommodation in a terrifically convenient place. Excellent hotel, well appointed, extremely clean. We had very good service from staff serving the food and from Reception staff. Well done to all. The menu was extremely limited and didn't allow any real choice. The food that was served was shockingly bad - the coating on the squid was mushy and uncooked; the macaroni cheese was full of flour that hadn't been cooked out, was pale, completely lacking in cheese and, to boot, cold. The 'special' was cannelloni and that was more of the same. The hotel was very let down by the food but that can't detract from the main function of the hotel which was the provision of excellent accommodation and comfort."
5492,Seamus,2021-07-22,Superb The staff are very helpful Nothing
5493,Raymond,2021-07-21,Very good Close to the airport. 4 am breakfast provided for early flight. Helpful staff. Quiet. Comfortable bed. Fairly ordinary food and drinks
5494,Valerie,2021-07-20,made a 0700 flight less tiring close to airport. easy for early morning flight. Good idea to have breakfast bags available to eat at the airport
5495,Tim,2021-07-20,Very good Newish airport hotel. All facilities you would expect. Very clean. Breakfast totally ok. We had a family room. The sleeping couch is very uncomfortable.
5496,Nigel,2021-07-19,Good Very clean Food availability limited.
5497,Steven,2021-07-18,Very good I found the whole hotel to be welcoming and comfortable.
5498,Elayne,2021-07-18,Comfortable bedrooms and spotlessly clean Room and so close to airport Wanted a cooked breakfast but unfortunately our flight was before 7.00pm which is when a cooked breakfast would be served.
5499,Ceri,2021-07-17,Superb It was clean and comfortable. Just perfect It was perfect 😂
5500,Liz,2021-07-14,Good Clean and comfy.
5501,R,2021-07-12,"Good site and ideal for airport stay. Easy to find and very close to main terminal. Plenty of parking so able to unload cases easily and parking was free to resident. Staff very helpful and facilities clean and good service. Quiet with few guests due to pandemic. Limited evening meal menu, probably due to pandemic.Choice from about half a dozen items for main course and all fairly basic."
5502,Sarah,2021-07-10,Very good Handy for airport Breakfast was poor
5503,Gary,2021-07-10,PRE DEPARTURE STAY Staff very helpful Reasonable breakfast choice for early departure Limited food menu but understand this at present times
5504,Gardner,2021-07-10,Very good Great breakfast
5505,Marta,2021-07-09,"Handy stay over Proximity to the airport always a bonus especially with an early flight. Staff always friendly and helpful The pillows provided - just 2 of them, were uncomfortable and we would have appreciated additional ones being available"
5506,Simon,2021-07-08,"Table service but not enough staff. Room was very comfortable and food (when it arrived) was good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Lasagne was tasty, and plenty of it. Pizza was well cooked. Service in the bar/dining area was very slow. Took over an hour to have two beers, two meals and two shorts. Staff were not very attentive. Tables weren’t cleared and drinks orders were taken and then took 15 minutes to arrive. They were absolutely lovely and friendly, but just not very quick. Three staff in the dining/reception area to check people in and look after ten people in the bar. I can do that on my own. Place is very over priced (£120+ for two people for bed and “breakfast”, which consisted of a bagged croissant, fruit, coffee, juice and fruit juice - but they have a captive market, have to recoup money from being shit down, and can ultimately charge what they want due to the location. I don’t mind paying the money for the convenience, but they need to make it worth me spending the money. For that money I would expect a decent breakfast to be available before 0600 for a start."
5507,Julie,2021-07-06,"Very good Great location, very clean. They need more vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. No cereals for breakfast."
5508,Michele,2021-07-06,I will return again due the next business trip Great bedroom . V comfortable The wake up call didn’t happen. Needed for early flight
5509,David,2021-07-05,"A good night's sleep before a decent cooked breakfast and short walk to the airport Friendly, helpful staff. Perfect location"
5510,Peter,2021-07-05,Great exp The exceptional service. Breakfast was mediocre
5511,Iain,2021-07-05,Superb Very convenient to airport ie walking distance
5512,Andrew,2021-07-04,Superb Room facilities very good. Bed very comfy. Great location Continental breakfast was terrible. Not a good selection. Items not fresh .So disappointed
5513,Derek,2021-07-04,Very good Most things but room could do with USB points and a fridge.
5514,Andrew,2021-07-04,"Great location Staff was really nice. Conveniently located at airport Bed was so hard ,Breakfast took so long to get"
5515,Derek,2021-07-03,"Superb Rooms good nice shower and great staff. Breakfast was disgusting, 2 stale pastries and a small orange, threw it all in bin."
5516,Steve,2021-07-03,Superb Close to airport Nothing
5517,Kerry,2021-06-30,Lovely short break Very quiet and everything we needed Extra pillow would of been nice
5518,Jess,2021-06-29,Good Handy for airport. Staff helpful Good sized room. Not very good selection of evening meal and early breakfast croissant and pastry’s did not taste at all fresh bearing in mind room was with breakfast
5519,Jaydeep,2021-06-28,Amazing staff Breakfast was amazing and the staff was super Lack of staff and parking charges.
5520,Julian,2021-06-27,"Short, utilitarian but nice stay. Limited dinner menu unappetising so ate locally Excellent and cleanly cooked breakfast ; Lauren was lovely and made our son waffles with chocolate sauce when she overheard him mention it. The car park fee was an unpleasant surprise and should have been clear; it will always cause problems even discounted."
5521,Kate,2021-06-27,Superb Clean and great rooms Not enough staff Breakfast was a nightmare
5522,Sudhi,2021-06-27,Good Manager was really good and very helpful Some of the staff was not very helpful. Restaurant menu was very limited
5523,Dorothy,2021-06-25,Perfectly located hotel with super staff 5 minutes from the airport. Incredibly clean. Very welcoming staff and comfortable rooms. Really good service in the Lounge/restaurant and a particularly great guy on reception who couldn’t have been more helpful. Continental Breakfast from 4am was really helpful. Could have done with maybe one healthier dish on the menu but wouldn’t stop me returning.
5524,Keith,2021-06-24,"easy hassle free stay ,close to airport proximity to airport, lovely homely hotel lobby, bedroom great size but decor maybe not as nice as lobby and communal areas...a little stark in comparison proximity to airport but good public transport link to city if so wished"
5525,Wendy,2021-06-20,"Superb Friendly, good covid safety measures in place, vegan food was good. Nothing was objectionable"
5526,Jackie,2021-06-18,Relaxed stay over before early morning flight Clean sanitised room. Consiidering the hotel is a few minutes walk from the airport it is very quiet. early flight and due to COVID take away continental breakfast bagged reasy to go.. Expected to be reduced evening menu and it was sorry to say not up to usual standard.
5527,Andrew,2021-06-15,Very good Warm welcome although the hotel appeared quite empty. All satisfactory
5528,David,2021-06-14,"Can think of visit being bettered. Self, not into much breakfast. Wife very much enjoyed, eat well. My wife has Dementia so this was the 'good bye' visit to friends of long standing. The condition can be difficult but the staff could not do enough to help. Lovely people. Nothing"
5529,Karen,2021-06-13,"Superb Lovely staff, exceptionally clean rooms and bathroom. And so easy to walk into the terminal at 4am!! Incredibly small menu but I guess that’s due to the times we’re living in. But we managed and the food was good - especially the Korean chicken burger. The only slight negative was the size of the duvet - too small for the bed. But we were only in the bed for 4 hours before our flight so wasn’t too bad 😂"
5530,Karen,2021-06-09,Superb The rooms were lovely. Shower especially excellent. My bfast wasnt as warm as I would have liked but still edible. I appreciate it was very busy.
5531,Alyn,2021-06-06,Excellent service and very clean. Felt very safe during these times. Location and value for money
5532,Christine,2021-06-05,You definitely pay for being close to the airport departures The airport is so close to departures which is fabulous. The staff were very helpful and helped us with our problem. We thought the room very basic for the price we paid for the room. You definitely pay for being right next to departures. Breakfast was included but as we had a 7 am flight got a bag with a few bits in. Not quite what we expected. Could do a better job of that.
5533,Royston,2021-06-03,Perfect Room was comfy and quiet.
5534,Sonali,2021-06-02,"Next to the airport- great location for odd hour flights and very clean rooms. We had an early morning flight and chose Hampton because it is literally 5 minutes walk away from the airport. Very comfortable location. Only downside was taxi to city center was rarely available and we had to wait for 30 minutes until we got ours. For early morning flight, the hotel had arranged takeaway breakfast including juice/coffee, croissant and a fruit. It could have been a bit better but i am not complaining as i am not much of an early morning breakfast person. We took a three person occupancy room. The main bed was clean and comfortable but the sofa cum bed for the third person was very uncomfortable. That can certainly be worked upon."
5535,Iestyn,2021-06-02,Ceidrych Gwesty 1af Walking distance to airport Staff extremely friendly and helpful Quiet rooms Good bed Fairly priced car park - not airport rates!
5536,Craig,2021-06-01,"Decent hotel for the money Breakfast was really good quality and the variety was excellent. The rooms was nice and clean. The bathroom was really good with shower gel and shampoo included. Parking should be free considering the price of the rooms. Evening menu was not very good and the food quality didn't match the prices you charged. You shouldn't have to wait in a long que to get your parking ticket validated at the reception desk, they should have a better system in place for customers who have already booked in."
5537,Keith,2021-05-31,"A good airport hotel Very welcoming (Jez), very clean and comfortable room, very convenient location. Dinner meal choice was burger/pizza. Would have preferred ""proper"" (i.e. not fast food) dinner. Breakfast was good, though."
5538,Donna,2021-05-31,"Good Close to the airport Food not great (cold) but they gave us free desert which made up for it, and not long been open so we have to understand that."
5539,Yolanda,2021-05-27,Good hotel and great location Great room and location. My colleague arrived earlier but was not allowed to use the wifi as she was too early to check in.
5540,Yolanda,2021-05-27,Good hotel and great location The room was excellent and the location was perfect. My colleague arrived early and was not allowed to use the wifi as she was too early to check in.
5541,Cheryl,2021-05-26,"Airport Hotel with a friendly vibe Room was well laid out and clean. Location excellent for airport. Staff very friendly and helpful. Due to current restrictions on holidays abroad, there were limited choices for food available at the hotel. It was however nicely done and the staff were excellent. I would suggest any allergies or food restrictions are advised in advance to ensure a choice would be made available. The hotel is perfect for flights out from Bristol Airport and parking at the multistorey. Overall, very good experience."
5542,Jacqueline,2021-05-22,Good Location and cleanliness. Friendly helpful staff. Room a bit chilly and I mentioned at checkout that 2 pillows would have been preferable.
5543,Linda,2021-05-21,Superb Very friendly and helpful staff. Having to pay car parking charges. They were discounted though.
5544,Lynda,2024-05-01,The staff were the best thing about this hotel. We liked the staff. Extremely helpful and friendly and valued the customer. The location was perfect for a short walk to departures. Breakfast should be optional in case it's not needed. Bathroom very cold. A towel rail would be good. Check bathroom linen as ours had a hole in it. Parking should be free. This is due to Bristol airport taking over the hotel car park so not the fault of the hotel but negotions could take place to rectify this. Beds were very hard.
5545,William,2024-04-30,Great for trips from airport Really handy for departures from airport. Access from car park is ramped and easy to get to hotel. Serving meals and drinks can be slow depending on number waiting.
5546,Shivaun,2024-04-30,Exceptional Good location to the airport
5547,John,2024-04-30,"Essential for early flight Croissant only, v early flight Needs lift & covered way to airport"
5548,Jo,2024-04-30,"Lovely stay, so close to airport after a long day. Comfortable, clean & tidy. Excellent breakfast! Close to the airport, well sign posted. Comfortable bedroom, good shower, TV worked well. Bar was well stocked, staff friendly and professional. Breakfast was amazing, one of the best I’ve had in an airport hotel! Reception didn’t take my card details on check in and I needed to add this later when getting a drink from the bar. One side of bed was quite close to wall despite wide room."
5549,Anonimouse,2024-04-30,"Disappointing Convenient, of course, and completely met my low expectations. Overpriced, as cost of breakfast included, even though we flew too early."
5550,David,2024-04-29,Excellent spot waiting for flights. Location was convenient to airport Available food was excellent. Room was very nice. Staff very helpful. Nothing to complain about.

5554,Melissa,2024-04-29,"Great location, poor cleaning, not a place I would recommend if other options are available. Location is perfect. Very unclean, hair and blocked sink, broken door lock on room entry. Food gave me terrible stomach aches the next morning."
5555,Zoe,2024-04-29,Brilliant Everything Bed was a little firm but no problem
5556,Samantha,2024-04-28,Perfect for an overnight stay before early morning flight Perfect for an overnight stay before an early morning flight as the hotel is less than a 5 min walk from the airport. We were 2 adults and 2 teens and had 2 spacious connecting rooms which were quiet and we all had a very good night's sleep. Great that breakfast was available from 4am and the staff were nice and friendly. A bit pricey for a family of 4 for 1 night but we felt it was money well spent for the convenience.
5557,Richard,2024-04-27,"Exceptional The bathroom and bed are very satisfactory. The room is biggest and lied on bed then sleep fast. I don’t like staff has lots of write each other, it’s really late, we need sleep early. 🤨"
5558,Andrew,2024-04-23,From a 4 hour flight that was uncomfortable and late at night to a comfortable bed Room was good and comfortable breakfast was nice Price could be a bit cheaper

5560,Lisa,2024-04-22,Great location but rip off parking costs Great location and lovely staff but cost £60 for 1 night to park my car so ruined the stay as that's just a rip off Room OK but a bit small with 2 beds in it
5561,Lynnette,2024-04-21,"Convenient but pricey stay at airport Location, convenience, breakfast, position of shower taps Glass door on bathroom, size of bed, position of bed - 15 cms from wall"
5562,Claire,2024-04-21,"A Little Pricey But Worth it for the Convenience The location was superb - literally a few steps from the terminal. I was up at 4am, eating breakfast at 4.15pm and on the plane and flying by 6am as I had no luggage to check in. The room was sparkling and spacious too. Loved the 4am breakfast option and flight details on departure boards in the hotel. It was a bit pricey, but I appreciate I was paying for the absolute convenience of it all."
5563,Sharon,2024-04-20,"Good night sleep before an early wake up call Quiet, clean and comfortable. Nothing"
5564,Nicholas,2024-04-20,"The dinner experience was disappointing, similar to a canteen. And overpriced for v. early departure The bed and shower After a 5 hour drive from Cornwall, due to accident on the motorway, we were not aware that the car park was not owned by the hotel and was not informed by reception that we needed to have our car park ticket validated. To return our hire car, and exit the car park, I had to pay £12 for 26 minutes. I find this unacceptable."
5565,Julie,2024-04-20,Hilton Always stay here. Great place

5572,Deborah,2024-04-12,"Expensive stay, necessary but not enjoyable. convenience of location, bed very comfortable poor reception on arrival. Staff very busy but not welcoming. Being given a disabled access room without asking if that was OK with us. Very crowded, little food available, long delay, and wrong meal arrived! Food poor quality and poor value for money. The room was hot, hard to control temperature and no natural ventilation ie openable window."
5573,Angela,2024-04-12,Ok but don’t eat here Location was great Food and choice was appalling
5574,Lisa,2024-04-09,you know you are going to get a good nights sleep! great hotel if you have early morning flight or late back. very clean and very quiet.
5575,Maoiliosa,2024-04-09,An emergency last minute booking. Service was very good and friendly. Room was perfect. Menu for food was of very pool quality! Breakfast was good… but we ate from main menu…. And were greatly disappointed. Quality of food on menu very poor.

5580,Karl,2024-04-07,"Perfect hotel in Bristol Airport Location to Bristol airport was great 👍 The shower tray got full of water and drained very slowley, And a suggestion would be to have a lift up to the road area we're the airport is so that earthly people and disabled people don't have to go all the way around up the hill with the languages,wheel chair or there walking stick. Thanks"

5583,Elaine,2024-04-04,Perfectly met our needs Room and food All good
5584,Frank,2024-04-02,Best place to stay at Bristol Airport The bedroom was nice. We woke up at 06:00 because of the fire alarm wenon and everybody was running out. It was because a guest left the bathroom open and took a warm shower. The fog went out and set the alarm on.....Otherwise we should wake up later.
5585,Angela,2024-04-02,Very pleasant and good start to our holiday Our first visit was an ideal choice from the position to bus stop and airport itself the room was clean and all that was needed for our night over.Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice. The evening meal choice we found limiting
5586,Rasitha,2024-04-01,"Not a comfortable stay Continental breakfast. No AC in the room and windows cannot be opened. It was quite hot without the AC. Beware of parking , they charge £45 per night for parking. Not comfortable stay."

5591,Kathleen,2024-03-30,"An okay stay The room was clean, quiet and the beds were comfortable. The staff were lovely. The room was hot, so so hot. The food was awful and overpriced. Did I mention the room was too hot?"

5594,Hannah,2024-03-29,"Basic offering, no frills Location is wonderful. Walking distance to airport terminal. So easy. Very basic offering. No water in the rooms. Water charged at £1.50 for 150ml bottle, charge to the room only, no cash no card. Fire alarm went off at 630am, false alarm, no explanation. Cleaners banging hallway cupboard all morning after that. Came for a stress free start to the holiday and could have stayed at home."

5597,Phil,2024-03-28,"Get a grip Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport, your charging big buck for this. Location wise the hotel could not be closer to Bristol Airport, extremely convenient. The lobby was dirty. The staff were not welcoming or friendly. There was a stain on my bedding and the room was cold. The breakfast was a buffet and no proper full on 'English'. Just felt that the H by H are totally exploiting the location of the hotel in relation to the airport. You expect to pay more, but not at the expense of service, quality or cleanliness. Next time I will be trying the small privately run hotel less than 5 minutes away."
5598,Humphrey,2024-03-28,Exceptional Staff and service were excellent. Proximity to the airport was good. The room was clean and comfortable.

5605,Gillian,2024-03-25,Good choice hotel within minutes walk of airport Due to early flight it was good to have good choice of continental breakfast before going to airport. The staff were very friendly and the bedroom was comfortable and spotlessly clean.
5606,Bernardine,2024-03-24,Poor Next to airport terminal Food was shockingly poor - ultra highly processed with little resemblance to real food i.e. chicken supreme I wouldn’t actually identify any chicken in the email at all
5607,Emma,2024-03-22,Perfect. Super early flight so this is perfect! The BEST pillows I have ever slept on!!!
5608,Emma,2024-03-22,convenient but nothing special Location and friendly staff Bed wasn't that comfortable and the dinner menu was basic / limited. The price for the night was high for what you got.

5615,Shane,2024-03-18,Highly recommend Great comfortable hotel. Stones throw from departures. Staff were amazing and even recommended places to go in paris where we were going to visit after outlr stay
5616,Christine,2024-03-17,Use the hotel for all our early Bristol flight and no reason not to keep doing so. A quick breakfast but perfect for an early flight. closeness to airport is a bonus unfortunately on this occasion the walkway was closed. Evening meal - noodles - good.
5617,Rosaleen,2024-03-16,Poor value Bright and clean Food dreadful- microwaved cheap stuff Basic amenities such Netflix not available.
5618,Willow,2024-03-15,"Mixed feelings Comfortable beds, good aircon, good bedside reading lights, pleasant staff, excellent location Pathetic breakfast! Little choice of bread, no Marmite, most yogurt full of sugar, poor quality bacon and sausage. Disappointing given the cost of the room and the Hilton name. Only good things were the coffee and helpful staff (I needed gluten-free bread). General lighting in the room very poor - no central light. No shaving mirror Very expensive but it's the only onsite hotel so they can charge whatever they want"

5624,Tony,2024-03-05,"Exceptional Perfect convenient location literally outside the terminal for early flight departures or late arrivals. Inevitably a bit faceless as a transit hotel with little staff engagement, but does exactly what it says on the tin!"

5626,John,2024-03-04,"A very mixed experience. Good, but not cheap hotel who failed to deliver on this occasion. After a serious problem the night staff led by Gill did their best to resolve it. While our sign in was unwelcoming, when Gill took over a few minutes later and dealt with my complaint, she was excellent and ensured that next morning we would have transport to collect our car. Great service, especially when compared to my comments below. Poor communication. Through no fault of the hotel the footpath was closed which meant a 10 minute walk with two large cases, one of which had no wheels so a struggle for two aged 78. When we raised this at the hotel we received a totally unhelpful response at the hotel check in by a rather curt man on the desk. It appears that we should have received a message by text to say if we needed help then we could get it and how. No message ever came and the text that did only explained the path closure and the long walking route. There was supposed also to be a notice at the arrivals doorway, but nothing evident at 10.30 at night."
5627,Derek,2024-03-04,Exceptional Excellent breakfast Nothing
5628,Angela,2024-03-03,Exceptional Location. Buffet breakfast. Comfy beds. Car parking prices are simply extortionate
5629,Anthony,2024-03-03,"Room location spoilt it location Hi On booking we stipulated a room near the lift,this was on the booking form as my wife needs assistance mobility wise.We were given room 371 which is the furthest you can get from the lift. As it was only one night we put up with it. Very poor."
5630,Andrew,2024-03-03,"Very impressive. A well designed hotel with travel in mind and the staff filled the space well! This hotel has looked carefully at the needs of travellers needing to make a quick getaway. The design of the rooms - and especially the bathroom - was exceptional . No bigger than most airport hotel rooms, it made excellent use of space. From the sliding bathroom door that 'closed'the wardrobe to the simply but thoughtfuly designed desk, bedside tables, multiple power points and superbly positioned shower controls and soap/shampoo this room had been carefully designed with the traveller in mind. No space wasted. Everything provided - even a safe. A+ facilities. The front desk and bar staff also worked as a team in a well-designed lobby and cafe. Superb. At first I did not like the fact that we couldn't book the room without breakfast - but - the way that they had set up the buffet breakfast by the airport exit door was again so you could grab a quick bite en route. Again - very thoughtful layout and design."
5631,Madeline,2024-03-03,"Exceptional My bedroom was really good. The room was clean, the bathroom /shower was excellent. The breakfast the following morning was very good plenty of different choices to have.. All in all a pleasant stay. I had an issue with my booking when I arrived.. The gentleman could not find my booking. I told him my name but continued to say he could not find it! I had to show him an email from my booking. He said my name was too long and the system did not show my surname. I felt quite stressed after having my journey to the airport. After much discussion it was sorted out."

5635,Leon,2024-02-27,Clean and comfortable but lacks any buzz. The location is perfect for flights out of Bristol. You can be in the airport in 2-3 minutes walk. The restaurant and bar offering are poor and overpriced for standard on offer.
5636,Janice,2024-02-26,Very impressed with hotel and staff super comfortable room. very quiet and had a very reasonably priced meal in the evening. Staff very friendly and welcoming. Had good nights sleep and very good breakfast before travelling on. Short walk across to the airport terminal probably bit more choice for vegetarians on the evening menu

On arrival told not available and accepted extra sheets, and told to ring 0 and ask for them. On doing this told blankets were available and would arrive. Later call to our room denied their availability, In a somewhat fraught manner. Perhaps a better outcome could have been achieved by indicating that my request was not possible. The other problem was dragging suitcases from the airport to the hotel when a long detour. Best wishes John Friend (A fit 87 yr old!)"

5671,Deborah,2024-02-10,Nice hotel as close as you will get to the airport This is across the road from the airport breakfast and rooms were lovely and staff helpful however we didn’t know we could arrange assistance even though they knew we had a disabled person with us they never told us. I booked a disabled room and told them I had a 94 years old with me! So when we booked it said free parking by the time when we went they had started charging £45!! We weren’t told and after I complained they wavered it.
5672,Peter,2024-02-09,"We want to sue you for screwing up our holiday and dismiss your incapable mangers We were advised that that there is a short connection between the Hamilton and airport 2 minutes by walk way. We arrived were told the connection was closed. This we were told we would have we would have to walk around the long side of the hotel. We were flying to Cape Verde and so had no wet weather gear. The walk is steep. I have declared Medical Conditions: Hypertension, Cholesterol levels, Angina Coronary Angioplasty, Rheumatoid Arthritis. We asked manager for assistance he said no. I was exhausted when I reached the airport soaked as the rain was extreme. On the return journey I telephoned your hotel from Arrivals at Bristol Airport. The manager informed me the situation had not changed we would have to walk the long way round but I said it is bucketing down with rain. We arrived soaked manager said it was not their responsibility. Under Freedom of Information how many other complaints have been made between 29-01-24 and 6-02-24 We want to sue you for this. You should have provided a mini bus service to the airport. You totally screwed up our holiday. Under freedom of information act I want to to know how many complaints you received 29-01-24 to 6-02-24"
5673,David,2024-02-08,Bad  The closure of the normal pedestrian route is wholly unacceptable when the alternative is a long detour. Blithely expecting your customers to haul luggage in the wind and rain beside a busy road at night is very bad for any hotel but for one that sells itself on convenience it is utterly unacceptable. You should have insisted to the contractor that a reasonable diversion was in place before proceeding with cutting off the normal route. If that was not possible you should have clearly forewarned your customers so that they could make alternative arrangements.
5674,Penelope,2024-02-08,"Only stayed as no better option Room quiet and comfortable convenient to airport Awful food choice, people queuing to order drinks and food, no waitress service. We went to M&S in airport to buy better quality fresh food."
5675,Jessica,2024-02-08,"Okay. Lovely and Clean. As we didn't arrive till early hours in the morning, we were able to extend the room departure till 2:00pm until our car arrived to collect us, free of charge, I just had to sign up to the Hilton honours. Arrived off the plane, and had to drag our suitcases in the pouring rain to the hotel, it says a minute walk from the airport but this was misleading as my daughter, friend and I walked for about 5-8 mins to get to the hotel, (maybe a car to collect would of been okay) For the price of the room, £180, the bed sofa was really hard. Breakfast you had to serve yourself, tea & coffee was through a machine, the breakfast was okay but no fried eggs, only scrambled and boiled??? I am not a snob by all means but 180 for a room, service could of been better. After a long flight, hardly any sleep maybe being served breakfast would suffice."
5676,Pilotmitch,2024-02-08,"Disappointing The location was good, although the walkway was closed, which was not advised on booking which meet awful walk around in the rain and 40mph winds. The food is awful, the restaurant was freezing, the atmosphere sad. The entire stay was expensive and disappointing for a Hilton honours hotel"
5677,Kirsty,2024-02-07,"Staff were amazing. Room and facilities not so It was close to the airport. I don’t believe it was worth the price we paid for it, the room smelt damp."
5678,Joan,2024-02-07,Great Location and lovely hotel Room & breakfast were lovely. Nothing.
5679,Sarah,2024-02-07,Good. Really clean hotel room and had 24hr reception. Food was good ( not alot of choice) but what I had was very good. Bit expensive and works to existing footpath meant a long walk around the road to the entrance with heavy luggage.
5680,Sandra,2024-02-07,"Convenient, friendly but expensive for the level of comfort you get Great location for airport and staff super friendly and breakfast plentiful Bed quite hard and rubbish pillows - the kind that look plump but squash down flat when you sleep on them (so one is too thin but two is too high)! There is a lot of construction going on at the airport so the pedestrian access between parking, hotel and airport is a bit all over the place at the moment"
5681,Lawrence,2024-02-06,Excellent Everything
5682,James,2024-02-06,Disappointing pre holiday stay Airport on site location within easy walking distance to terminal. The evening menu lacked inspiration and the quality of the food was woefully inadequate.
5683,Mike,2024-02-05,"Pleasant That it is close to the airport Access was poor due to building works and badly signed.The bedroom was good but heating poor. The facilities provided for the lounge,bar and restaurant were very minimal which also describes the menu."
5684,Nicholas,2024-02-05,Will probably use the hotel again when we have a very early flight Access to airport Walkway was closed due to major work Special Assistance had to pick up 3 hours before flight 4.25 am

5692,Mike,2024-01-30,Had it been raining I would have had to take another very expensive taxi to the hotel. The airport is in partnership wit Location next to Bristol Airport Normal access route denighed due to electric substation falling down a sink hole. Airport provided signage very poor. I have formally complained to the airport about my experience. I am not alone!
5693,Alexandra,2024-01-30,Was going to Paris Close to hotel A bit expensive
5694,Gillian,2024-01-28,Put up with it as the only hotel in the airport Close to airport Rooms freezing and so was public areas. Food depressingly poor and expensive
5695,Ann,2024-01-28,Disappointing stay. Location The 5 minute walk through the tunnel to the hotel became a 12 minute struggle with large suitcase and hand luggage because of poor signage diverting foot passengers due to tunnel closure. No prior warning and no explanation. Lighting in the hotel was not working between lifts and first floor nearest the airport. I reported it 3 times before it was repaired. What should have been easy became a real struggle. NOT IMPRESSED
5696,Lauren,2024-01-28,Exceptional Very competent and friendly staff. Good food.
5697,Rebecca,2024-01-26,"Wouldn’t book again . Arrived and had to walk a diversion with a child and heavy cases which wasn’t significantly sign posted, noisy rooms and air conditioning, generally not a great experience, wouldn’t say it’s a close to airport hotel with current road restrictions"

5707,Simon,2024-01-22,Considering cost as solo traveller was disappointing but location for early flight excellent Very good curry as evening meal. Bedroom not warm enough. Duvet too thin. Shower tray drain blocked so tray filled up

5710,Laura,2024-01-19,"Expected better service for the price. Spacious and comfortable room, very close to terminal On checking in, the key card I was given initially for my room didn’t work and had to be replaced. Despite me turning the heating up in the room, it remained very cold. I eventually discovered when I phoned room service that the heating for my room had been turned off centrally, not impressed! Given it was a cold January evening, the heating should have been turned on automatically as soon as the room was allocated to a guest."
5711,Sonja,2024-01-19,Pleasant  Perfect for a lay over flight
5712,Simon,2024-01-18,Overall an enjoyable stay. The location Nothing
5713,Caroline,2024-01-18,Great place to stay for an early morning flight - quite expensive but was worth it for a leisurely start to the holiday. Location for early morning flight. Dinner and breakfast very good. Beds were comfortable. Quiet - good nights sleep. Staff were very friendly- especially the guy behind the bar. The sofa beds in the room could be improved- the metal bars on the sides are not very comfortable when getting in and out of bed.
5714,Martin,2024-01-17,"Nice hotel, bad experience with cold room. Clean hotel, nice bar and sitting area. Close walk from airport. Cold night, had to ring reception for heating to be put on, after getting in a very cold bed we awoke to no heating. Had to put on hoodies and socks. Room had a disability shower / wet room, with seat and grab rails. After using the shower water ran into the carpet area, had to put towels down to stop flow of water. Room 307."
5715,Jayne,2024-01-17,wouldn’t recommend to anyone good location for airport rude and unfriendly staff. price of parking for 1 night room cold. general hotel run down. not even a biscuit in the room
5716,Ruth,2024-01-16,Exceptional Really friendly staff Great location Perfect if you have an early flight
5717,Andrew,2024-01-15,It was okay but only stayed one night. Proximity to airport. That the parking fee for just dropping off was so expensive for less than 5 minutes.
5718,Sanders,2024-01-14,Calming Sanctuary Twin beds were huge and SO comfortable. Breakfast excellent. Bathroom lovely. Check in and out times perfect. All good.
5719,Nancy,2024-01-14,Wonderful start to our holiday! Room was extremely comfortable and clean. Breakfast choices were amazing. I cannot fault this hotel.

5721,Robert,2024-01-13,Convenient to terminal Location was ok Location ok. We had continental. As it was 4.30am Breakfast selection extremely poor especially as I’m a diabetic. Cereal was Only cornflakes. Just 1 type of cheese 1 type of ham. Europeans will be thinking this is not a continental breakfast. No oats or porridge u could microwave No hard boiled eggs. Making it awkward on the carbohydrate front.
5722,Eve,2024-01-13,Exceptional Location and comfy beds and rooms The breakfast wasn't the best
5723,June,2024-01-13,"Great hotel, comfortable and clean, friendly and convenient Clean, comfortable, friendly, convenient for airport. We were happy so nothing."
5724,Victoria,2024-01-12,Very convenient if you are catching a morning flight - you can just relax before flying. Great location to the airport just about 100m from the main building. Breakfast was great. Room was clean and comfortable and the gym was well equipped. i picked up a good deal otherwise it would have been too expensive as a solo traveller. It was all good.
5725,Christopher,2024-01-12,I would definitely stay in the hotel again Very clean and comfortable. Good atmosphere amongst staff. Excellent food and customer service.
5726,Wendy,2024-01-11,"Hotel ok, parking absolute rip off and no drop off point fornpeipme who don't need to park Continental was ok We are going to get a fine because someone dropped us off outside the hotel and just like that there was a camera van there. When asked why that was and why we were not told there was no drop off point we were told that you were allowed 1 hour free parking. When you werent looking for parking why would you look to see parking charges. Absolute rip off. Won't stay there again."

5730,Timothy,2024-01-11,Nice hotel. people suck!  The staff wouldn't validate my car parking ticket when i returned to my car as promised to me by the ginger guy on the desk. Therefore the car park reduced rate was not applied.
5731,Dr,2024-01-10,"Below average Overall experience was poor Rooms were noisy, cramped and poorly ventilated"
5732,Lulu,2024-01-10,"Very nice short stay. Convenient and easy to work everything out. Staff were helpful and had a smile to greet and help. Ahh the only thing was the toilet roll didn’t have much in it. Thought that was counting the pennies a bit too far! That said, did that really matter in the grand scheme of things, there was a new roll there anyway!"
5733,Jon,2024-01-10,Great location for transiting stays Directly outside the arrivals terminal. Age assist access to room and bathroom perfect for my aging father. Very comfortable stay. Car parking access very bad even for collecting people from this hotel.
5734,Louise,2024-01-09,"Very easy and convenient. Will be back. Loved the quite rooms, the location and the convenience of it all. The beds were immaculately clean and very comfy too. We were very grateful for the adjoining rooms. The breakfast was a bit sparce for the early flight."

5746,Julie,2024-01-04,Very good We have stayed a few times and it takes all the pressure away trying to get to the airport. You feel so flaxed before travelling.
5747,Lars,2024-01-01,"good value for money, confortable The breakfast was great and started so early , the location was amazing andthe room was all that it needed to be, perfect for overnight stays before travelling on to your destionation There wasn't anything that I didn't like. it met all of my expectations for an overnight stay at the airport"
5748,Jagerplymouth,2024-01-01,"This hotel takes away some of the ""hassle"" of flying. Location to airport terminal and coach stop ideal. Excellent reception staff on both occasions stayed either side of holiday. Cheerful comfy room, good sized bathroom with plenty of shampoo, conditioner etc. Good breakfasts, both continental and full English. Evening meal proportions good with fair choice of dishes, pizza option especially so! For a hotel of this standard I would have expected a toilet brush in the bath/wc room."

5756,Lee,2023-12-29,"Expensive hotel, small rooms, great location The location is great. It is the only on airport hotel so nothing else to compare it with. The fact I had 2 rooms booked apparently. They were going to look into it as I had prepaid in full for 1 family room. The room wasn’t ready when we arrived, after check in time. Then when it was the additional sofa bed wasn’t made up. It felt like guests were an inconvenience to hotel staff. It is not the typical Hilton experience. There is a sense of arrogance in that it is the only on airport hotel so they don’t really care what you think of it."
5757,Aled,2023-12-28,Poor value for money and over priced It is adjoining the airport so is within walking distance. At £143 the room is small and I expect more that a camp bed for an 11 year old. Considering Premier Inn room 2.3 miles away is as £43 and included a family room with breakfast.
5758,Stephanie,2023-12-28,Great airport hotel. Great clean modern hotel. Quiet despite being on the doorstep of a busy airport. An ideal place to stay when flying from Bristol. Breakfast starts at 4am which is great. I only had time for a hot drink and a great looking fruit salad. However the pineapple and melon were so tough that they were inedible. The only edible part was the watermelon. Disappointing.
5759,Antti,2023-12-27,Not a Hilton Decent room. Some friendly staff. Rather poor and expensive food provision on-site.

5766,Terence,2023-12-23,"No choice at Bristol Airport. Room was comfortable and clean and heating adequate and responsive. Bed was also comfortable and relatively firm. Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful as we're the young people delivering food to table, but no table service as such. Once again, the 'so called' restaurant was extremely disappointing with cold air blowing down on several uncomfortable seating positions (we moved twice!). This is probably the least comfortable pr intimate 'restaurant' I have ever patronised at any time, anywhere in my eighty years and would not have looked out of place in any motorway transport cafe. Very little choice of menu and I suspect nothing was cooked to order but rather reheated in microwave as required. Food portions were very small and quality just about acceptable. Meals and drinks had to be ordered at the bar with completely extortionate prices charged for drinks (Guiness @ £4.00 / half pt., Draught bitter @ £5.70 /pt.)"

Good choice of food both breakfast and evening and reasonably priced plus a well stocked bar, offering a great selection of drinks to suit everyone and the staff extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. Think it's a bit pricey overall to stay here but there is nothing I would change in the hotel or rooms."

Every member of staff made me feel welcome. Special thanks to Sema, who checked me in. Credit is due to housekeeping - every surface was immaculate. The shower basin was too low, the shower water flooded onto the floor."
5781,Sioned,2023-12-12,Bad Great location Poor customer service. I was charged twice for the stay and told that my card had been “rejected”. So I was charged when I got there and through booking.com. It wasn’t dealt with well.

5783,Janet,2023-12-10,"Quiet night pre-flight disrupted by fire alarm going off at 1 am!!! A short walk from the Departure Hall at Bristol Airport, Ideal for a pre or post flight stopover. Comfortable and clean room and friendly staff. Being woken at 1 am by the fire alarm going off and having to evacuate the hotel, and wait outside in the cold with all the other guests for more than half an hour until the fire brigade had been and verified that the building was safe to re-enter. Someone had apparently been smoking in their room - it is a non-smoking hotel - which had set off the alarm system. Not a pleasant experience - but at least it wasn't raining outside!!!"

Really liked the shower also. It was fairly pricey for the food and drinks but that was expected. Unfortunately the one thing that affected the stay was the sleep, the bed was really uncomfortable and my partner and myself struggled to get a good sleep. It was a shame because everything else was great!"

Will definitely be staying there again with my family. Nothing.

My husband has mobility issues and the reason for staying at the airport hotel was to make the journey easier. Room was also not well laid out; a double bed was so close to the wall that it was impossible to get in and out of bed,"
5802,Lewis,2023-11-21,"spot on, close to airport, great hotel Close to airport, clean, spacious rooms, good food and drink downstairs, especially the pizza which was excellent, would most certainly stay here again the next time we fly from Bristol airport. Thanks nothing at all. Everything was spot on."
5803,Simone,2023-11-21,"Great location, super friendly staff Close to airport Building work ( out of their control but there as no pre warming )"
5804,Jim,2023-11-21,"Comfortable pleasant All good, nothing special"
5805,Victoria,2023-11-20,"Adequate Close to the airport Miserable staff, rooms very basic, clinical and expensive. I would not stay there again."
5806,Krittika,2023-11-20,Exceptional I loved my stay. Hopefully would book back again on my next trip to Bristol Breakfast was served early at 4 a m but consisted of mostly sweet and cold foods. I was hoping to grab a warm meal before my flight which was at 8 but hot meals were served only after 6am
5807,Christine,2023-11-19,Perfect airport hotel Simple enough hotel but very comfortable room and most helpful staff. They arranged special transport to the terminal for me because my leg was in a splint. Restaurant is cafeteria style but very efficient.
5808,Sarah,2023-11-17,"Makes everything easy peasy! This makes everything soo easy. Multi storey right next door, and check in the other side. It’s all walkable and easy. Phew!"
5809,Jane,2023-11-17,"Airport hotel Convenient clean accommodation, handy for the airport . Excellent inclusive breakfast and ok bar food. Expensive drinks £8 for a glass of red wine medium size! Noisy aircon in bedroom"
5810,David,2023-11-17,"Convenient location, good hotel just pricy Nice smart hotel, super convenient location for airport. The price we paid for what we got felt steep, really felt like they where milking the location and lack of competition for everything they could."
5811,Janet,2023-11-17,Convenient and comfortably for a short stay Great hotel for departing Bristol Airport or to stay and regroup when arriving back late at night. Comfy rooms. Food is a bit basic but it works OK as only there for 1 night.
5812,Russell,2023-11-17,Chose this hotel purely for the location as we had a early morning flight Nothing to much trouble for the staff. The bar staff were fantastic The price of the hotel bar is very excessive.
5813,Gillian,2023-11-16,"An a enjoyable overnight stay. I liked the fact that the hotel was close to the airport, and the staff were friendly and helpful, room was of a good size, bed very comfy, abd clean shower a good size. There was a very good selection of food for my breakfast. In fact I have nothing bad to say about my stay, if only for a over night stay, so much so, I've booked in again for a overnight stay in January 2024."
5814,John,2023-11-16,Completely satisfied and would visit again if need arose. Exactly what I want in a hotel. Convenient location. friendly welcome. Clean room. Convenient restaurant. I would not expect better.

5819,Stuart,2023-11-14,Stay due to flight cancellation Staff were fantastic
5820,Richard,2023-11-13,Disappointing Closeness to airport Walkway to hotel. Restaurant facilities. Price of a glass of wine.
5821,Karen,2023-11-13,"Lovely stay and close to the airport but it was rather expensive for just one night thou It was ok , wasn’t all that hot thou The breakfast"
5822,Trevor,2023-11-13,One word very enjoyable We liked everything about the Hotel the location was perfect for us staff were lovely and our rooms were outstanding. I will be recommending the hotel to family and friends. Just leave it the way it is its perfect. As the old says if it's not broken.
5823,Kerry,2023-11-12,Exceptional  Price was steep for 9hours
5824,Rostgaard,2023-11-12,Fab customer service ☆☆☆☆☆ I asked them to put pictures of Bruce Lee in my husband's room and THEY DID!! Fantastic customer service. We've stayed many times as a family of 7 too and add it on to our holidays from Bristol Airport.
5825,Anthony,2023-11-12,"Pretty average, didn't think value for money Check in easy, very peaceful no airport noise at all. Quite a trek from the airport as lots of ground work taking place for the foreseeable future, pleased it wasn't raining as would have got drowned. Bed not as comfortable as expected but acceptable, breakfast average."
5826,Elaine,2023-11-11,Great hotel Lovely staff great location great comfortable bed Wish it was a little cheaper as expensive when adding onto holiday Worth it though for location
5827,Beverley,2023-11-11,"Great location, perfect for early or late starts. Breakfast was great, especially good gluten free selection."
5828,Janis,2023-11-10,"Very comfortable stay, wish it had been longer access to airport, room very comfortable, loved the armchair and footstool, had dinner the evening of arrival -food very nice, staff polite, service prompt and friendly. Continental breakfast- amazing choice and variety of options I was only in hotel for 14 hours. There wasn't anything I disliked"
5829,Paul,2023-11-10,Exceptional On line The building work on the walk to terminal
5830,Clare,2023-11-09,Excellent for the night before an early flight. Close to terminal. Very pleasant staff. Great breakfast. Comfortable beds and very quiet. In the morning light and having found it the night before it was a three minute walk to the terminal. Works on airport grounds made finding it from the terminal in the dark(after twilight baggage drop) a little challenging but it was signposted and we got there without too much of a detour. It was a little expensive (quite a bit more so than the Premier at Gatwick North) as was parking which might make me reconsider Bristol as a choice as we are equidistant from both.
5831,Jennifer,2023-11-08,Needs must next time I’ll drive Close to airport The food was awful.. no effort made because customers have no choice
5832,Derek,2023-11-07,Exceptional Everything was perfect

5837,Nicola,2023-11-04,Have now stayed twice and will repeat stay for early flights Perfect for airport and early continental breakfast
5838,Julia,2023-11-03,"Average hotel and expensive for what it offered. Lousy access route Efficient check in. Clean, comfortable room Booked specifically for location, this was negated by the VERY poor arrangements associated with the airport works. A ten minute walk through pouring rain was definitely not what we hoped for or expected. We paid for a convenience that was just not there. Maybe a senior manager should walk the route from the airport terminal, with a suitcase, at night in the rain and see if they think the arrangement is acceptable!!! Overall result means expensive one night stay without the expected convenience"
5839,John,2023-11-01,"The hotel was perfect for what we wanted after a long flight late at night. Adjacent to the airport. Breakfast was excellent. Staff, checking in and checking out were very helpful and friendly. All the building work which made a terrible trek to reach building."

5844,Andrew,2023-10-27,"Excellent: will stay again Everything was good: location, soundproofing, cleanliness, comfort and bathroom. The staff were first rate. I didn't bother with breakfast as my flight was early o'clock but what I saw looked good. I didn't not like anything! Will definitely stay again when travelling through the airport."
5845,James,2023-10-26,"Disappointing The room was a nice size, the breakfast was good An extremely COLD roim. I had to ask for the heating to be turned on, unacceptable, it was soooo cold"
5846,Elaine,2023-10-26,"Nice and close to the hotel , great staff , bit expensive It was fine , staff really helpful, bit of a mix up at dinner but easily fixed Nothing it serves its purpose as an airport hotel , would use it again, although it was very expensive I suppose you have a trapped audience , but we liked it"
5847,Reeve,2023-10-26,"Good clean hotel, ruined by an expensive car park. Easy to reach from the airport, large comfortable rooms cleaned to a good standard. Car parking is far too expensive, even with the discount from the hotel. Total rip off."
5848,Jones,2023-10-26,Exceptional All of the stay
5849,Tanya,2023-10-24,Exceptional We always stay here if we are flying anywhere Nothing to not like.
5850,Lee,2023-10-23,"Not our Best Experience Location is ideal for flying from Bristol Airport and one member of staff who could apologise enough for or issues we experienced whilst we were there The way we were treated when questioned over payment, which had been made through Booking.com earlier that day , in front of an ever increasing queue of people waiting to check in. I showed proof of payment via my banking app and the confirmation email I received from Booking.com . After what seemed to take ages and more people joining the queue, she eventually went and got her manager to assist with trying to find our payment. After her seemingly checking numerous monitors and with lots of clicking and me offering to show proof again , we were told that it sometimes it happens when payment made via Booking.com that both parties fail to communicate with each other. Luckily, another position was opened, and the queue subsided whilst she was still checking things and we were eventually getting our key. There was no real apology, and the manager did say she would contact Booking.com and confirm that payment had been made. On checking out the following morning, we were then questioned again for payment, to which I said this should have been sorted the pervious night and I also showed proof of email and payment again to the staff on the desk , which was then accepted. We always book the hotel on site when flying from Bristol even if we are travelling on a later flight the following day, so we can start our holiday as relaxed as possible, but we really didn't feel relaxed this time."
5851,Natasha,2023-10-23,"We will be back!! Perfect location for meeting up with other family members and catching a flight the next day. Rooms were lovely and clean, beds comfortable and facilities were top notch!! Booked again for another night very soon. Forgot to buy toothpaste so begrudgingly had to pay £2.99 for the worlds smallest tube of toothpaste and toothbrush, as it was the Hilton,something like that should be complimentary."
5852,Jude,2023-10-23,Exceptional Handy for airport Expensive
5853,Russ,2023-10-22,"Disappointing  Because of building work, the route to the airport was tortuous for someone who needed a wheelchair. There was no warning of this. Our room had an unpleasant smell. The reception/ bar area was stark, unwelcoming and over priced, with a mediocre food menu."
5854,Graham,2023-10-22,Made the start of holiday very easy and straight forward Super convenient for airport and early flight Car park for hotel super expensive

5860,Carolyn,2023-10-19,Not sure I would stay again for 200£ I paid - over priced Good mattress The bed was definitely not a king size The shower had body hairs in it from previous guest and stains on the duvet
5861,Betsylita,2023-10-19,"Great place to stay when you have an early flight. No complaints at all. I had an early flight the next day so decided to stay at the Hampton. This is a great hotel - yes, somewhat expensive at about $200, but worth it for the convenience and the amenities. Easy dining experience (order at bar and food delivered to table). Lots of sitting areas. The room was excellent, spacious, comfortable, quiet, good quality all around. Probably a 10 minute walk to the airport, especially as at the time I stayed (early October) there was a lot of construction requiring a circuitous path to the terminal. Nothing"
5862,Alan,2023-10-19,Very comfortable stay rooms very clean How close it was to the airport Bar prices altered every time you go to the bar but having same drinks
5863,Badlydrawncat,2023-10-19,Great for an early flight Friendly hotel with lovely staff. Comfy room and bed. A short walk to the airport makes this hotel ideal for late night arrivals or early-morning flights

5868,Katrina,2023-10-18,In theory would be a good location when no roadworks. Definitely need more staff on reception as queues extremely long. Close to the airport. Although close to the airport because of roadworks it wasn’t!! Signposting awful.
5869,Anne,2023-10-18,"Rather soul-less place. Does what it says on the tin, everything there for breakfast. Room was clean and the tea/coffee facilities good. Shower and hair products in bathroom good, too. Our biggest bugbear. The floor of the shower was so slippery. It was highly dangerous and needs sorting before someone really hurts themselves, if they haven't already. Whatever products are being used to clean the shower floor need looking into."

We was hoping to get a cooked breakfast before we flew out. But was told cold breakfast was served at 4am to 6am. We didn't get a cooked breakfast as we left by 6am. Paid £198 for overnight stay.

Thank you Perhaps a quicker route from the airport to the hotel while the road works are being done? Maybe it just wasn’t possible because of the work that’s being done. My mum is 90, still walks unaided but we found it just a little frustrating that we had to go in one direction then back again."

Staff excellent during fire alarm giving out emergency blankets and ensuring no panic. Proximity to airport. Fire alarm at midnight meant an hour in the car park waiting for three fire engines. This wasn’t the hotel’s fault but it wrecked my stay and I had no sleep afterwards because I had to get up at 3am for my flight. I also didn’t like my taxi having to pay £5 just to drop me off at the entrance."

I am gluten free (NOT Celiac) and aside from salad with things missing and tomato soup which is too acidic, there was nothing for me to eat, I could have done without the fire alarm just after midnight. An hour or so in the breezy parking lot with everyone, dressed only my pajamas was interesting but very cold entertainment despite everyone being considerate and helpful. I stupidly left everything in my room, including my coat. They eventually brought us blankets. It was worse for the parents with kids. It's always important that the whole hotel got checked out by firemen but then I had to get up before 4 am to catch my flight."

Fire alarm went off at 11.45 pm Tuesday 20th. Wd waited outside for over an hour. Luckily it wasn't raining. This disturbed our sleep as we had to be up at 3.30. The whole point of staying at the hotel is to get some sleep before our early start. Does the hotel provide a room only facility.?
5936,Kay,2023-09-21,"Disappointing The location is good, in walking distance to the airport. I stayed the night, so I didn't have to get up early for my flight, but I was awoken by an alarm going off in my room at 5am. It took 10 minutes for someone to come and sort it out. When the lady knocked on the door, she said, ""Wake up, call. Really!"
5937,Bobbie,2023-09-21,"Passable The staff were all very friendly and helpful. There was an incident with the fire alarm going off at around midnight and the staff were all great, remained calm and kept everyone in the carpark warm with blankets while the fire department cleared the building. The fire alarm went off at around midnight, which no one could help. But given we had to be up at 6am for a 9 hour flight the following morning. This meant we were extremely tired as we weren't able to re enter the building until around 1 am. Also our kettle didn't work, we only discovered this the following morning so had to go to the breakfast area to get a coffee which we hadn't intended on doing."
5938,Dorothy,2023-09-21,Mediocre Restaurant staff. Proximity to airport. Queuing in a snake at bar to place food order. When food was brought to my table it was ok rather than good. Large dining area almost like a cafeteria. Asked desk to book me a taxi and was told there was a taxi booth in the airport!
5939,E,2023-09-20,Exceptional Very helpful staff. Food fine. Bed very comfortable. It’s very convenient to stay at the Hampton before an early morning flight.

5941,Monica,2023-09-19,"Very short stay, but clean, warm and quiet and very helpful staff. Breakfast adequate, but as I had an early start I did not appreciate the whole menu. There was nothing to dislike, just the early start which was nothing to do with your service."
5942,Barrie,2023-09-19,"Great location, comfortable room, mediocre breakfast, has become expensive Comfortable beds. Breakfast choice was significantly better than before but still basic with cooked items looking as though they had been out for a while. Huge price increase from previous visits. Cooked breakfast items looked as though they had been out for quite some time. Undercooked bacon"
5943,Kevin,2023-09-19,"Expensive Clean & friendly Very expensive for what it is, nearly 3 times the price of a Heathrow ring hotel"

Breakfast included, great service,lovely hotel, perfect location."
5953,Roger,2023-09-15,Exceptional  The only hotel at Bristol Airport. Quite expensive because they have a captive clientele.
5954,Hannah,2023-09-14,"Nice hotel, but easier to get a cab on the day in future. Very pleasant staff Not enough staff. Queued to check in, order drinks, order food. Food choices were also poor in the evening. Path outside the hotel was dug up so hard to negotiate"
5955,Wendy,2023-09-13,Dissatisfied We had a breakfast bag which was good but the evening meal and wine was poor and expensive Food and 2 pillows on the bed

5960,Tracy,2023-09-10,"It transpires our room was swapped earlier in the evening. Appalling way to run a service. Cleanliness, geography to airport. I booked months before on booking.com a twin room for me and my 30 something daughter. I clarified the room the day before flying back. On arrival at approx midnight I was told by the receptionist did I want the bad or the good news. They no longer had the room I had previously booked and paid for but had a queen bed and sofa bed. The sofa bed mattress was approx 1.5 inches thick and you could feel all the springs. At that time of night following flight back there was no choice. Neither of us got hardly any sleep. (I was told by reception the following day it is only suitable for a child."

5968,Joanne,2023-09-06,"Staff and facilities great, bed very uncomfortable.  We stayed in room 165 and the bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable. We have stayed at the same hotel many times before a flight and this was the first terrible bed we’ve had!"
5969,Heidi,2023-09-06,"After a long day travelling it was the perfect end to our holiday, just what we needed. The property was very calm and quiet which was perfect as we arrived at 03.30 hours and just needed some sleep. The room was modern, clean, quiet and dark (we needed to sleep). The breakfast was lovely and the whole experience left us feeling refreshed and calm. Nothing."
5970,Kent,2023-09-05,Nowhere to beat it !! So convenient next to the airport. Staff brilliant and breakfast exceptional. Lovely big room which was spotlessly clean. Will always book there when travelling from Bristol. Nothing.
5971,Christine,2023-09-04,Ok but downhill since last stay Close proximity to Airport Main Entrance The property was fine but some of the staff lacked finesse and one in particular I found quite sharp and unfriendly
5972,Carol,2023-09-04,Perfect location. Friendly staff. So close to the airport. Did not hear any planes. Louis on reception was very helpful. Takeaway breakfast as we were leaving at 4am. Nothing
5973,Elizabeth,2023-09-04,It was fine but disappointed with the bar and restaurant Close proximity to airport comfortable bed and room The restaurant was understaffed and limited in its food and drinks choice…they had no cocktails to choose apart from one

5975,Hillevi,2023-09-03,"Exceptional Location, staff, breakfast. Steep price."
5976,Gowercoast,2023-09-03,"Stay if you have a 6am flight and have children to get organised. Put car in Silver Zone I have stayed many times. Soundproofing is excellent and always found the rooms Clean and well appointed The location is excellent and the staff are always pleasant, polite and willing to help if they can. Expensive to stay now despite booking months in advance. No longer good value..The Food is very hit and miss. The Breakfast is cheap end quality and if you have an early flight you dont get the complete works only continental, which is Okay .The car park is expensive. The beds are hard, which is fine if you dont have any skeletal issues eg arthritis ..The pillows aren't much better. so I always take my own. As I left the car park to take the car to the Silver zone the night before. I stopped short of the road but just after the exit barrier, to reset SAT NAV. That cost me £60 as security accused me of illegally stopping ..These stories are becoming more common. SO I will be giving other places a try from now on. Im done with the Hilton for now"
5977,Danielle,2023-09-03,"Exceptional Perfect location, easy to find and straightforward to find the airport parking"
5978,Alison,2023-09-03,Facilities fine but misinformation re transport infuriating resulting in considerable difficulty. Convenience for airpory Misleading information from staff regarding booking assist to get to terminal resulting in missing transport. Extremely difficult for us to get to the terminal.
5979,Joseph,2023-09-03,"Great location, exactly what was needed Excellent distance to Bristol Airport Terminal and Multi-story car park. Comfortably room. Nice bar area & good food. Nothing to dislike"
5980,Carl,2023-09-02,Exceptional Comfy beds. Beautiful pillows. Very clean! Easy check in / out. Reataurant. Very basic menu. Burger or pizza. Unless you’re a vegan or want a sandwich.
5981,Carol,2023-08-31,"Over priced Location chosen because of early flight There is no competition at Bristol airport Check in good, everything else poor Restaurant Very average poor choice of food Expensive drinks"

5984,Anna,2023-08-29,Disappointing Over priced most uncomfortable sleep springs sticking out the matress Dirty bathroom
5985,Don,2023-08-29,Exceptional Room was silent from air traffic noise and spacious.
5986,Jessica,2023-08-27,"No water supply - entirely unacceptable!  There was no water supply when we woke up in the morning, due to a broken water pump, hence the poor ratings for comfort, value for money and facilities, and staff were completely unprepared and unhelpful in responding to this issue. We were unable to use the bathroom at all. Having travelled all day the day before and arrived very late at night, we were desperate for showers when we got up, but couldn't even wash our faces. Staff were clueless and didn't offer apologies or alternatives, it seemed no one had taken charge of the situation. Very poor from a large chain who should have effective contingency plans in place for critical services like water supply. A 30% discount was offered which was then not applied to our bill. I have complained and asked for a refund and await hiltons response."
5987,Alison,2023-08-26,"Expecting a luxurious stay but had to leave at 8.15 am with not even basic hygiene requirements met. Not hotel's fa I thought it was ok - rather bland but clean and comfortable The water completely failed on the morning of my stay. No shower, wash basin, nowhere to clean teeth, no ability to flush the loo or even make a cup of coffee. Guests not notified about this."
5988,Anne,2023-08-24,"Excellent for an overnight airport stay. Good sized room with two beds as requested, quick check in and good breakfast. Finding the hotel from the airport terminal was difficult as few signs - and roadworks made it difficult to see the access path."
5989,Luke,2023-08-24,"Pleasant Location, clean . Good staff Over priced. Food was average"
5990,Luke,2023-08-24,Nice clean hotel with a great location . Could be a 4 star with some improvement. Do you can see why it’s only a 3 The location . The staff were good . Overpriced. Tv didn’t work . Food average .

5998,Stanton,2023-08-20,Would not stay there ever again. Glorified premier inn. Over priced for what you get. I was put up in a disabled room that stunk of urine. You have to pay extra for parking at the hotel. There was no mini fridge in the room. No room service and because of the location there was no shops to get food or drinks.
5999,Hayley,2023-08-18,Clean and comfortable Room clean and comfortable and breakfast was great Can’t think of anything
