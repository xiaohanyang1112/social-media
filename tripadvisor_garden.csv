We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we entered the hotel and shown to a lovely window table in the restaurant. We were looked after by the wonderful Marta who was so helpful without being too intrusive, Marta is a real star. A lovely selection of sandwiches, cakes and scones and we were even provided with some boxes to take home several cakes which we didn't manage to eat. A wonderful experience, many thanks to everyone involved.","0","","2024-05-31","2024-05-01","2024-05-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r949065122-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Buffet breakfast is lovely and the restaurant I have used on a few occasions for evening meals.
The thing I love about the bar in the hotel is Chakir who works the bar most weekends.
He is so lovely and welcoming and even remembers what my preferred drink choice is when I am staying.
Big comfy beds, clean bathrooms
Only criticism is try not to get a room on the 3rd floor if you are working as this seems to be the party revellers floor that are having a Saturday night out in Bristol so it can be a bit noisy","0","","2024-04-30","2024-04-28","2024-04-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r948625026-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The only criticism I can provide of the stay is perhaps the size of the bathroom and the position of the toilet making it difficult to use for the larger person.

Apart from that, a fantastic stay!","0","","2024-02-29","2024-02-29","2024-02-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r940174760-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Reception staff were engaging and friendly and checking in was quick and easy.

Room was sufficient. It was comfy enough for 1 nights sleep as somewhere to get your head down. A little rough around some edges but nothing bad enough to complain about.

Breakfast was very good. On arriving to the restaurant, we were greeted by Arc who was friendly and informative. Love a big smile in the morning!!!

The beds are comfy and rooms and bathrooms clean and spacious. Despite being clean my only concern is in my room there was some staining on the desk seat, curtain pelmet and the wall. Other than this the room was spotless. The staining isn’t obtrusive so it’s more aesthetic than an actual issue hence me not bothering to raise it. Also there’s a spacious mini fridge which was helpful. 

The reception staff were very welcoming and friendly and somehow the main atrium smells amazing almost like a really nice aftershave which I really enjoyed. 

I opted for breakfast to be included and was very pleased with it, their English breakfast was delightful, properly cooked and flavourful. The only critique I had was for the pastries as they were a bit tough, perhaps a tad over baked but still edible and they go down well with a cup of coffee. They also have coffee syrups available which I greatly appreciated, not a lot of places bother with them but I love them so was pleased. 

I had two people serve me during breakfast, Navi and Priya, they were so welcoming and attentive, made sure I had everything I needed and were swift to remove finished plates. I felt very well looked after.

Overall I’ve enjoyed my stay here and look forward to returning next time! 

Thanks for having me! 😊","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/25/7c/f7/caption.jpg

Credit to the new management team is due where all the staff in this hotel make the guests there no1 priority, the ambiance they give out with their warming smiles is ama img to see.

There continuous effort from reception to the f@b staff with Subash and Patricia, cleaners and the Night team is applaudable.

The rooms are not the biggest but they serve there purpose, with the large TV’s, walk in showers and a desk for your business requirements. My room was spotlessly clean and my bed remade every day which I did not expect.

Breakfast- In the past I have criticised this but this now seems to be resolved with fresh hot breakfast with plenty of choices for croissants, fruit and cereal along with all your Juices. The coffee is supplied by machine with various types of hot drinks available.

Dinner has gone up a notch too, despite the new staff who are very welcoming, I was honoured when the Chef called Aimee personally delivered my delicious dinner to the table, what a personal touch! Food was delicious in flavour with great presentation.

The Bar with Ethan , what a polite gentleman was quick and efficient too.

My check in and out, Is far better than any other hotel with that warm personal touch from Annie, Juan and Peter and the rest of the team.

The complimentary gym is a small gym but served me brilliantly for my purpose, A couple of bikes and a treadmill with a weight set.

The Christmas decorations look great!

Service: 5","An almost perfect hotel","What a delightful stay we four old school friends had at this hotel. The hotel is situated within easy walking distance from the railway station and in a slightly longer walk to the town (but still walkable). Our twin room was fairly small and the bathroom was very small. However, they had everything necessary for a good night's sleep - a comfortable bed, excellent toiletries. The only time the size was a problem was when  the four of us wanted to meet in our room for a chat and there was no room to sit except on the beds.  The lounge/bar area could also benefit from more comfy chairs. The best part of our stay was the wonderful breakfast - the best buffet I have seen in a long time and poached eggs or an omelette cooked to order. Wonderful. I must mention Ash (Subash?). He made a big effort to ensure we were comfortable and had everything we needed, both at breakfast and later in the day when we were chatting near reception. He's a star. 
All in all this is an almost perfect place to stay and  would definitely book again if I'm in the Bristol area.

My only criticism of the place is how they automatically add 10% service charge to the restaurant AND then also ask for a gratuity.  Easy to miss the 10% charge on the bill when there is a large space lower down for you to also write in a gratuity.

To me this implies that you can recharge your EV free of charge if you have paid the £20 overnight car park fee. This is not the case. You will be charged the standard rate per KWh as shown on the BP Pulse EV charger - currently £0.79 per KWh for a Type 2 connection.

Three members of staff behind the desk, check in still takes an age. Had to spend 10 minutes whilst the member of staff figured out that I didnt have to pay for the room as the business had already paid it but was adamant that I needed to pay. Once she had sorted that without any sort of apology whilst making me wait 10 minutes and show her a number of emails I finally got the key which didnt work so back downstairs to get that resolved.

Air con does not work, the room was absolutely boiling.

Will not stay again and instead stick to the Moxy whose rooms are so much better, air con works and parking is half the price or less.","1","","2023-09-30","2023-09-17","2023-09-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r917098165-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Service: 3","A couple of housekeeping issues and poor sleep quality.","The hotel is located a short 5 min walk from Bristol Temple Meads station. Staff were welcoming and friendly throughout the stay. Guest rooms are small, but sufficient for a shorter stay. 

A small buffet breakfast was available, with poached or omelette cooked to order. For dinner, the service was good (the waiter was attentive and good care was taken over allergy requirements) - the pizza however was a bit doughy, and the lighting was exceptionally bright thus ruining the ambience.

The condition of the bathroom in the first room allocated was not in keeping with a Hilton - dripping plumbing in the shower cubicle, broken soap dispenser and a stained toilet seat. Upon raising with reception, they capably resolved the matter with a change of room and provided a complementary drink from the bar whilst I waited. 

The main issue was the sleep quality - one of the least comfortable mattresses I've ever slept on (I stay in hotels 2 months per year) and given the noises from the springs clearer long overdue for replacing. Air conditioning was noisy and did little to cool the room, with only a small window partially opening as an alternative. I was not asked how my stay was on departure.

As sleep quality and housekeeping standards are non-negotiable for me, I wouldn't recommend a stay.

The rooms are compact but adequate. Housekeeping a tad patchy, waste bin (almost overflowing) not emptied however more disappointing was the breakfast offering.

Day 1 the hotel appeared not to be very busy and a lot of food had been cooked and left under heat lamps for what appeared to be a long time. Consequently the bacon was extremely tough and the fried eggs together with the sausages, hash browns and baked beans were well past their best.

Day 2 the hotel was much busier and there was a higher turnover of the breakfast items improving the overall offering to OK.

For me, part of the hotel experience is the good old full English so from this experience I would not plan to revisit.

Staff were efficient and friendly at check in. The rooms are tiny, basic and dated, but reasonable for the price and location. Air con was very noisy, and you can only over ride it for about 30 mins before it kicks back in - which woke me up a few times in the night. In the morning, reception told me they could have remotely switched it off had I called down - fair enough. I was just trying not to wake up too much. 
One of the soap bottles fell off the wall in the bathroom in the small hours, which also woke me up (they are just held on with a sticky pad). 
The beds are extremely firm. Pillows and duvet are heavenly and there is a good selection of pillows of different firmness. 
There's a knack to getting in the shower as the doors open onwards into the shower. It took me a few goes to work it out as the door was quite stiff. The door wouldn't stay shut while showering.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/29/26/bd/52/caption.jpg

This post is not about how to get free things. It is about the kindness of staff going extra mile like Bailey and Victoria on reception.
I really had had a terrible day, and their kindness was most appreciated
It is also to say that when things go wrong, they apologise and put it right, which was the polar opposite of my experience at the Marriot the week before

The bar and restaurant serve quality food and drink and there is parking on site too (chargeable). Staff are professional and efficient. I also liked the outside terrace at fe back of the hotel to enjoy a quiet drink with the sun setting over the city.
 
My only criticism of the hotel is that because it sits on a main road was the noise from the front and that the A/C was ineffective. Despite the window being shut road noise is still there and if you’re a light sleeper you may be affected.

The A/C control instructions didn’t match the controller in my room and whilst the fan was blowing and thermo down it simply didn’t effect the temperature and in the end it was just too noisy and I switched it off.

I wouldn’t choose this hotel on a warm Bristol night.","0","","2023-05-31","2023-05-02","2023-05-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r888758464-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms are clean and the beds are soft and comfy. You have also been supplied with all the products to clean with like shampoo, conditioner, hand wash and even body lotion.

I think the location of the hotel is perfect. It is only a 15 minute walk to college and its not near any shops or pubs so its quite tranquil in the evenings and mornings.

To be fair the lady on reception was great on arrival and very friendly.

Got a room on the third floor at the back of the hotel so it was quiet.

The rooms are much smaller than Premier Inn and the bathroom is really tiny.

The worst thing of all was the beds. It was a twin room and it wasn’t until returning much later in the evening that I got in bed and realised how very uncomfortable both beds were. They were really rock solid and creaked at every movement. My back and hip were aching from lying on the bed so I had to lay on a pillow which wasn’t ideal but at least gave relief from the mattress. I thought about going to reception but it was late and as I was only staying one night I couldn’t face trying to move rooms.  Didn’t have a good night at all.

Tried the fitness centre which was reasonably well equipped but no instructions on how to use the machines which would have been helpful.

When I left no one on reception asked how my stay was which I thought was incredible.

Didn’t try the bar or restaurant so can’t comment on these but based on this stay I won’t be going back to this hotel as it was very disappointing. 

To me the room should be built around the bed and this must be the most comfortable feature. Sadly Hilton failed miserably in this regard.","0","","2023-04-30","2023-04-22","2023-04-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r887279763-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Room needs a makeover and should not be made available to guest until it has been done
Various shades of white paint does not look good, paint the whole room do not just touch up.
Hanging rail in wardrobe had dust on it
Arm on the writing desk chair was damaged making it look ugly
Ceiling in shower area paint was peeling off
And finally there was poo in the toilet bowl

Did not want to make a fuss while we were there as it was a birthday celebration and did not want to spoil the day/evening 
But had to write this review as I do not want other guest paying for this room before it gets a full makeover

The room was cramped and the bed was very uncomfortable. The walls were grubby and in need of a fresh coat of paint, but overall the room was clean. Lots of noise echoing down the corridor until well past midnight. Other guests slamming doors mainly. Not ideal when you when you want an early night. 

I checked in quite late and checked out early and was still charged full 24hr rate for parking which was £20. 

My rate was for bed and breakfast, but was listed as room only in the restaurant so had to present my booking confirmation to prove this. Poor for a 4star hotel but the member of staff handled it well. Wide range of options for breakfast and the food was tasty. 

If you are looking for somewhere to stay and don’t need the frills of a restaurant or gym, then you get a better room for a cheaper price at a travelodge or premier inn; both of these are nearby.

I did read some of the poor reviews after I booked but for one night I valued the location over anything else. Happy I stuck to my plan. The hotel was absolutely fine. Modern, comfortable and spotlessly clean room. Efficient and friendly staff at check-in. The parking charge is a bit steep but I guess it's normal in the city centre. My only minor criticism - given that the room appeared to be recently renovated, the lack of USB charging by the bedside was odd. Driving to the hotel was hugely frustrating - do NOT attempt to navigate to it using the main hotel address! There is no vehicle access from Temple Way, which has clearly been designed to frustrate drivers as much as possible with ""no turn"" restrictions everywhere and absurd one-way systems everywhere. Navigate to ""Temple Rose Street"" instead which will take you to the car park entrance at the rear of the hotel.","1","","2022-11-30","2022-11-21","2022-11-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r869219604-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Annie on reception was very friendly and helpful, as was everyone else we interacted with during our two day stay.

Our room was fairly small but was modern, quiet and had a nice view over the park.

The safe was closed when we arrived so we couldn’t use it the first day we stayed. The gentleman on reception did offer to stow our valuables in the hotel’s safe though. There was a small window in our room which did not close properly. And unfortunately our fridge didn’t work either.

One thing I missed was hotel information. There was nothing in the room, I’m guessing because of Covid. I had to ring reception to find out what time breakfast was.

Breakfast buffet was good, although we got there at 9.30 and items were running out (eg no more yoghurt). The pastries and eggs and bacon were delicious. And there was real orange juice!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/26/89/6d/9e/caption.jpg

We’ve had less problems at Ibis when we stayed in them. We book Hilton as last resort because there are always problems with the rooms. The staff is lovely and they make up for the shortcomings with the rooms/building/equipment. In this place Peter and Viktoria were great help and made us feel like we were important customers. I hope the company rewards them accordingly as they are true assets to the Hilton brand.

I chose egg on toast and the eggs were cold. Coffee machine had powdered milk in it so was a bit minging. Pastries were hard and the fruit was sour. A bit of a let down on that front!

Firstly there’s nowhere to park, not nearly enough spaces for such a large hotel, had to go in and ask where to park and in the end the lady at the check in desk told us to just park in the electric car charging station and the next morning people were parked up against the kerb next to the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful which is probably the only benefit to this hotel. Walked in the room and it was… underwhelming for a Hilton but I don’t really mind about that. 

As an honors member when I usually stay in Hilton hotel’s the beds are usually very comfortable however this one was not, very boxy and hard had an almost cardboard top feel to it, and if you plan on staying here I hope you like ultra soft pillows that sink to the level of the matress when you put your head on them.

Now for the reason I wrote this review. The bathroom definately had not been cleaned properly, there was facial hair on top of the shavers socket and on the silicone holding the tiles to the wall which I have attached pictures for. As for the toilet, well let’s just say the bottom of it looked like brands hatch race circuit. I didn’t say anything at the time since I was only staying 1 night and was leaving very early in the morning but I knew straight away I’d write this review! 

Overall very disappointed and expected much better from a Hilton hotel!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/25/9f/c0/1f/caption.jpg

We stay here a lot (on average every other week) because it is right opposite our office. But we’re going to find somewhere else (Holiday Inn most likely). The beds here are crippling (can hardly stand straight in the mornings), my room has not been cleaned or restocked (it’s 6pm) but the biggest problem is the restaurant. Last night they had a big party in so was told couldn’t eat in the restaurant. Tonight they have another big party in but they cannot serve anyone else any food. That is ludicrous for a City Centre hotel aimed primarily at business people. What do they expect guests to do - order take out? Cannot fault the staff, they are doing the best they can but the hotel needs to take a long hard look at itself. At the very least they should tell you when you check in there is no food at the Inn.","1","","2022-08-31","2022-08-22","2022-08-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r855725495-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The window opened slightly but the hotel faces on to a main road and there was a lot of building works going on around the hotel so we were unable to leave the window open for any period of time. The breakfast was very poor quality and the bed was terribly uncomfortable.

Overall, not really what we were expecting for the price paid and the fact that it is a Hilton branded hotel.

However the hotel did sort it pretty quickly once reported and the remainder of our stay was pretty comfortable.
Forth time staying here, perfect place for a break, close to the train station, bus routes to Bath and Wells, and a ten minute walk in to town, perfect location.
Rooms have everything you need, iron, safe and fridge, great comfy bedding and super shower. Room cleaning seems back to normal, immaculately cleaned every day.
Staff are super friendly, always polite and professional.
Breakfast is pretty good, everything you need, great coffee, and now a waffle making machine which was a treat. Nice bar area to have a pre going out drink especially on the terrace outside.
Would have got 5 stars if it wasn’t for the air conditioning, but it became a distant memory and once again the Hilton added to another great weekend break in Bristol, thank you, see you in 2023.","1","","2022-07-31","2022-07-25","2022-07-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r849860803-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We had a dreadful night's sleep so much so that I went down at 6am to complain. We went to Wells for the day and when we came back a maintenance guy was just finishing repairing the air conditioning. Our thanks to him and after that we had no further problems with the temperature. Also there was no TV remote but someone from housekeeping sorted us out with one later that day.

The lady named Brittany was really friendly but the older gentleman in the suit spoke to us in a condescending and grumpy manner. During the first night the air conditioning kept switching itself off, making the room uncomfortably hot. The next morning we went down to the front desk to ask for it to be repaired, and whilst there asked for our room to be made up by housekeeping. Said grumpy man then steps in (despite not talking to him), seems annoyed and starts actually lecturing us on how the hotel is now back to “full service” and that our room will automatically get cleaned by housekeeping as long as the do not disturb sign is not hung up. He kept repeating this over and over again, practically forcing me to apologise for disturbing the front desk before he got off his high horse. 

So we took him at his demeaning word, and the next day did not stop by the front desk to request housekeeping. We come back at the end of the day to find our room has not been made up by housekeeping despite the do not disturb sign being off our door when we vacated the room for the day at around noon. Annoying. 

The room itself does have a fridge, but other than that is small and pretty basic in terms of furnishings. Super powerful shower. Beds are rock-hard, as other reviewers have noted. Housekeeping staff were pretty noisy (chatting, shouting down their phones, clanking, and continually slamming doors shut of the rooms they’re cleaning), waking us up every morning during our stay.

Beware if you go for a (more expensive) “park view” room that there is a building directly opposite which has demolition work ongoing, with the associated noises. 

Final note; there are EV charging points, but these were occupied by non-EV vehicles every night.","0","","2022-05-31","2022-07-08","2022-07-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r846840218-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Overall, I wouldn't rule out staying again, maybe just consider other dining options - oh and they add a service charge too which I personally loathe, I always leave a tip but dislike being dictated how much.","0","","2022-05-31","2022-06-18","2022-06-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r843401461-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Pleasent and very helpful efficient staff

Room / facilities:
Room number 528 is on the 5th floor and is clean with a green park view,  the room contains a queen bed, 4 pillows (none of which were to my liking), hanging area, small bar fridge, safe, iron and board, tea and coffee facilities, desk and chair and single chair. The room is cosy and the bathroom is very cramped and poorly designed.
We had house keeping knock on our door at 8.30am, when she was aware we were to check out (but had not yet) and were due to check out by 11.00am.

Another staff member was in the lift as it arrived on our floor.  She quickly tried to close the door before we could enter the lift.

The room does have self control air conditioning with a window that opens 3 cm.

Laundry: 
Self service coin laundry with 1 washers and 1 dryers costing £1.20 per wash and dry is  £0.20 per 12 mins 

Parking:
Parking is plentiful for about 30 cars and costs £16 per night. Car registration is required at checkin. 
We arrived back to the hotel at 3.30pm after a day out, and there was only 2 car spaces left (seperate to the 3 electric car charge stations).  Having paid a hefty price for parking and to not be able to find park, is unacceptable.  The hotel staff confirmed that the hotel does over book car parking to the level where cars park in non designated car spaces, and almost lock other vehicles in.

Wifi:
Complementary and good speed. No validation or password required.

Breakfast:
Available for additional cost, but not utilised on this stay.

Conclusion:
Great location and staff, close to city centre.

Letdowns:
Small bathroom, possibility of not having a car park upon your return in the afternoon/evening, window that does not open more.

Location / Nearby:
Bristol city and all its offerings are a close 10 min stroll.
Tesco express market and Pret a Manger coffee within a 4 minute walk.

Beware:
No matter where you drive to, payment for parking is required. Most parking meters accept coin and card “tap” facilities. Generally after 6.00pm or 8.00pm parking is free, in designated locations.

Some rooms weren't ready so we were all invited to go into the bar for a complimentary drink until we could go to our rooms..  The dinner which was served buffet style for our coach party only, and was excellent with a good choice on the menu.  My room was quite chilly on arrival due to the air conditioning and I couldn't change it. I spoke to Reception and asked if they could switch it off.   They were very apologetic and said they would do that and would I like a heater delivered to my room? Or, if I preferred I could change rooms.   I was quite happy to just have it turned off.  However, after dinner I was in my room when a very nice young lady delivered a heater in case I needed it and again, offered to change my room which I declined.  Breakfast was again buffet style with plenty of choice.  All the staff were absolutely lovely and extremely helpful.  We went out for a walk in the evening and the situation of the hotel is quite nice with a park opposite and you are not far from the river.  I would certainly recommend this hotel and once again a big thank you to the lovely staff.","0","","2022-05-31","2022-06-06","2022-06-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r841731461-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Service: 5","Our Favourite Hotel","My partner and I chose this hotel for our April 'just because' stay and it was brilliant. We got a discount for signing up to the Hilton Honours programme directly on their website, making it £253 for 3 nights, which we were happy to pay. Not only was the good price one of our main reasons for choosing it, but also because the location was fantastic. We downloaded the app and were given the opportunity to check in the day before, as well as having easy access to lists of facilities and recommendations etc. 

Upon our arrival, we used the app to check-in early and choose a room, but unfortunately the room we picked wasn't available as it was yet to be cleaned (note we got there at 12, when check-in is 3!). They gave us the choice of them picking another random room, or for us to come back later, which was what we did. They looked after our luggage for a few hours whilst we went to explore. When we came back to check in, our room still wasn't available due to maintenance so they gave us an alternative. The staff member who organised this was incredibly helpful and spent a long time going over a map of Bristol with us, giving various recommendations. 

When we got to the room (second floor), we were pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious, clean and well-stocked with facilities. The bed was a good size, with the TV directly across from it. The room was well lit despite being next to a building on the other side of the road. Everything felt premium quality. The bed was a little hard but we both slept well every night we were there. The only issue we encountered in the room was the TV; the time set on the TV was different to the actual time, meaning the TV guide was completely out of sync and unusable. Although this was a hassle, we were able to use the Freeview TV guide on their website instead to match everything up, so it wasn't a disaster, more an inconvenience. 

Our location was absolutely fantastic. As it is tucked away, it is not too noisy and you get a pleasant walk through the park when going into the centre. On the other side of the hotel there is a bus stop that goes directly to the zoo. It's only a 15 minute max walk into the centre and it is pleasant any time of day. You walk past so many food places on the way and Tescos etc, so you're always able to be well stocked. 

We could not fault our stay. I would have said 4.8 instead of 5 to account for the TV issue but as this was not an option and I feel so positively about our experience, a 5 point rating seems the most appropriate score. If it weren't for us trying new places, we would definitely return to the hotel! Perhaps in future if we feel we want to experience the same quality as we did for our short trip. All staff we encountered were fantastic and we felt safe and comfortable there. It was the ideal hotel for our first trip to Bristol.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/22/fb/7f/d2/view-from-our-non-park.jpg

It was great to meet the new reception manager Alex and Juan who went out of their way to make me feel welcome throughout the week.

The rooms aren’t massive but very comfy but are plenty big enough for 2 people and copious room for working with all the amenities you need. But they have a great bathroom and the rooms and hotel are spotless!

The food at Breakfast and Dinner has only got better and better with the lovely David and Karla and Mario and the chefs who assist when needed treating their guests with abundance of energy and warmth.

My check out by Peter was excellent as always and worked like clockwork.

The lovely patio area is starting to fill as the days get warmer.

A special shout out to the young cleaner on the 2nd floor who went out of her way to say good morning and asking how my stay was, this was a first and started my day off in a great mood - Thank you.

For the first time it was great to see the hotel practice their fire evacuation and this seemed very smooth with no issues.

The room was exceptionally clean and well maintained.    

I also had a gorgeous view of the park.

The icing on the cake was how well Peter at the front desk looked after me during my stay at checkin, during my stay and checkout.

I am a frequent traveller on business and will ensure this particular Hilton will be my hotel of choice when in Bristol.

Clean, quiet, modern and with aspects that you don’t realise are a blessing. Plug socket next to the bed head, comfortable pillows, one larger bedside table, great toiletries including sanitising wipes, no stray hairs from previous customers (this is my number 1 put off)
Each floor has a beautiful fragrance, which is immediately noticeable, fabulous dinner, very tasty (I had Salmon) and a good breakfast.
One tiny shortfall, lasting impressions etc, when I checked out the male receptionist asked for my room card and that was it, no ‘how was your stay’ not even a ‘goodbye’, so even though I had a fabulous experience at this hotel, I wasn’t going to tell him, as he couldn’t care less.","0","","2022-02-28","2022-03-02","2022-03-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r829784149-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is conveniently located close to the station and it ticked all the right boxes. We had booked a king room overlooking the park and a special mention Ms. Elena at the front desk who was very helpful to give us all the info about the city and things to do. She also helped with moving our rooms when the heating wasn't working properly and went above and beyond in offering personalized service and care. We also didn't miss an opportunity to grab drinks at the bar and Ms. Carla made us lovely drinks throughout our stay. I would also like to thank Peter who gave us local recommendations of restaurants and things to do and places to see in Bristol. On the whole it was a lovely trip and the team at Hilton truly made it a memorable stay. Looking forward to visit Bristol and stay at the Hilton next time.","0","","2022-02-28","2022-02-16","2022-02-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r828190920-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Then, despite getting there at 3, the time people check out, the car park was full. It’s very tight too. You can park on the car park opposite but then would have to move your car at 8am as there’s no return. So, we parked on the (expensive) NCP car park round the corner.

Check in - there were 2 ladies on the desk checking in 1 person whose reservation couldn’t be found. We were left waiting which shouldn’t have happened. However, once served they were polite and friendly.

Room - used a base only. Appearances were good and adequate for our needs. We were 2nd floor road facing and experienced no noise at all, very peaceful. Which is why it is a shame the bed was just so uncomfortable! It was 2 singles pushed together and they dipped in the middle. Not what we expected.

We wouldn’t stay again due to the car park issues and u comfy bed.","0","","2022-02-28","2022-02-13","2022-02-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r827808824-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We had a room on the 4th floor and asked for one over looking the garden to the rear of the hotel. This would certainly have been quieter than overlooking the ring road. 
Rooms were very comfortable with fridge, safe, tea and coffee along with toiletries in the en-suite bathroom. 
We did have a few drinks in the bar which was very Covid safe and in these strange times we felt comfortable doing so. 
On our first evening we also ate in the hotel restaurant as we had an evening organised walk to attend.

It's away from the noise of the city centre but only a 10-12 minute walk in to reach the the old port, shops and bars. Has its own parking although spaces are quite limited. Good price of £120 including breakfast- although that was the one disappointment. The bacon was barely cooked and my wife said her mushrooms were tasteless and the baked beans were cold. The fruit salad was basically apple, so good if you like apple. My hash brown was also cold. It was not the worst we've had but far from the best.

Found breakfast to be way ahead of similar hotels. Again staff so friendly. Eggs were being cooked to order, food replenished all the time, and the ambience of the restaurant was so relaxing and pleasant.
Close to shopping areas and directly by the train station. Can't think of anywhere better to stay in a mid-budget hotel if you are after a night or two in Bristol. Will definitely stay here again.
Had a 5th floor park view room. Will ask for this again.

We walked 10minutes to Cabot Circus which had a lovely array of top end and budget friendly shops.
The room was the cleanest we have stayed in, in a long time. It also smelt clean. Spacious with a good view on the 5th floor. 
Fabulous shower.
We had a meal booked in the evening at San Carlo which I 100 per cent recommend but be warned its not cheap.  Reception called us a taxi with no fuss.
As always ypu never get the same nights sleep in a different bed to your own and this was the case with the bed here. It wasn't uncomfortable and did sleep without discomfort. Very soft bed with two very soft pillows. Comfortable temperature in the room also.
Breakfast was included in our stay and WOW!!!!!!! 
There is something there for everyone. 
Cereals, fresh fruit, Buffet full English, continental, make ypur own waffles, tea and coffee aswell as fresh juices. 
I had a waffle with bacon and scrambled egg, and the hubby had a full English.
Wonderful.
Will definitely be booking here again aswell as recommended to others.
Thank You Hilton.","0","","2021-11-30","2021-11-02","2021-11-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r817167766-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

A welcoming clean and friendly Hotel and in an excellent location.

The room was very clean and the bathroom offered a fabulous shower.

We only stayed bed and breakfast but I have to say it was  just perfect with a vast array of food options and they accommodate well for the GLUTEN FREE diner. 
The dining area is very well kept, clean and a calm atmosphere and luckily with very helpful cheerful staff.

Checked in on a Friday night for 3 nights on a trip from Aberdeen with friends. Cherry is an absolute super star. She should be a poster girl for Hilton. Her service and attention to guests was absolutely second to none. Nothing was too much of a problem for her and when she saw us in the bar during the weekend she would come and chat to us all. Really nice room but hotels need to stop with the COVID excuse now and do housekeeping every day, not on request. Carla in the bar was another excellent member of staff. Friendly and professional. The hotel is a stone’s throw from Temple Meads so in a great location.

They must be well aware as thry had pre printed instructions on how to pay at the other parking area (max 4 hours). You need to pay at 8am to ensure you are not fined/towed. This parking was also full by 10pm.

Wish they would have been honest as when we spoke to the receptionist on arrival she said parking is full after 6pm and on weekends.

Rooms: 5
Service: 5","Comfortable city centre hotel","The Hilton Garden Inn is in a convenient location a few minutes’ walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station. It’s well located for the commercial district, but about 10-15 minutes’ walk from the main tourist and shopping areas of central Bristol and so feels a little detached from most eating and entertainment places. A bus goes directly from outside the building towards Clifton village and Bristol Zoo. The hotel seems to have plenty of car parking.

The room was a decent size and had ample storage space, desk, fridge, safe, coffee/tea and comfortable bed. The wifi was good and sufficient for video streaming. My room had a pleasant view over the Temple Gardens to the rear of the building and the city skyline beyond. I’d recommend rooms with that rear view, as the road to the front is quite busy.

The hotel offered a full self-service buffet of pre-Covid standards – full English hot and cold food, cereals, pastries, juices, etc. The staff were helpful and friendly in the restaurant, which also served evening meals. There’s also a small marketplace selling drinks and snacks.

Overall, this hotel won’t dazzle and isn’t in the heart of the action, but it is comfortable and offers a pleasant stay. It’s a good base for a weekend break in this interesting and attractive city. I was happy with it.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1e/88/71/fc/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

Bar service was substandard, and were twice told that ingredients for our drinks had run out. The hot chocolate made from hot water and instant powder, and served spilt without a tissue, not drinkable. All 4 drinks served separately with long wait times. No complaint due to the fact that we were using complimentary drinks vouchers, but as paying customers would've been rightfully annoyed.

Location was superb, just a short walk from Old City and City Centre, and the reception area was pleasant, with the fruity water provided throughout the day being a nice touch.

Sleep Quality: 5","Comfortable Stay, clean and bright rooms and friendly staff","A typical non-descript modern building from the outside the Hilton Garden Inn is very convenient for Temple Meads station (just a five minute stroll) and a little further from the harbour's lively facilities and the Town Centre, all in all around fifteen minutes walk from Central Boulelvard.

Once inside the modern theme continued and we had a very friendly greeting on checking in and our room was ready although we were a little early.

Our room (510) on the top floor was overlooking Temple Gardens and was quiet (probably much more so than rooms on the main road side), bright and modern with all the amenities expected for a City break. It looked as if it had been refurbished quite recently and everything was neat and tidy and the bathroom had an excellent shower. With a fridge, safe and tea and coffee making facilities  facilities it had all you might really need.

The bed was extremely comfortable although the room was not that large but ideal as a base.

The lifts were efficient and breakfast was taken on the ground floor restaurant and with lovely weather it was possible to eat on the outside terrace. It was so nice to be able to go back to having a breakfast buffet and people were being sensible all round. We did not eat in the hotel at lunch or dinner as there are so many excellent restaurants in this charming City.

The Hilton Garden Inn is an ideal place for a short stay break in Bristol and we would not hesitate in staying again if we are in town again.","4","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1d/71/30/eb/bedroom-with-double-bed.jpg","2021-07-31","2021-07-26","2021-07-26","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r799847766-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Rooms are still super comfortable, staff  continue to be super friendly, courteous and professional. Two things that have changed since my last visit is that its nice to see life again, people of all ages having fun whilst recognizing covid regulations.  Breakfast is a real treat, almost back to normality, everything you need, gone are the Croissants in a bag, and it proved that customers' can take and be in charge of themselves to be covid respectful, well done Hilton for making that work.  If I had to call out a particular member of staff it would be the ""hello my lovely"" breakfast chef, she surely brightened most peoples days up.  Also the poor barman on the Saturday night, even though he was so over worked with preparing non stop cocktails for several parties he remained cheerful, but this is where I think the on duty managers' should have got involved, in the words of Alex Polizzi role your sleeves up and poor some ******* drinks.
All n all, another great weekend in Bristol, comfortable room, great breakfast, lovely staff and a sign of life getting back to normal.  Thank you Hilton for a lovely weekend.","2","","2021-06-30","2021-06-29","2021-06-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r794759030-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room itself was ridiculously small, and as a result I left a couple of things behind. It was only possible for one person at a time to move around the room, so I never checked the window side when we left. Because of that, I left two items behind but the hotel sent them to me very quickly and efficiently, so full marks for that. They also went to some lengths to try and get us an air-conditioned room. We arrived on the first warm day of the year and the room was sweltering. In the end they got the air-conditioning going and we had no further problem. The rooms have fridges for the use of the people staying in them, which is very rare in the UK, where refrigeration is regarded with suspicion. For me, that automatically makes this the best hotel in Bristol. The breakfast was very good. The restaurant was adequate, if somewhat chaotic. The shower was good. The wifi was excellent after a few teething problems. I'd definitely recommend this hotel, and would be happy to stay there again.","1","","2021-06-30","2021-06-06","2021-06-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r791382819-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We booked a 'great escape' deal with dinner and breakfast and a variety of extras like a cocktail, antipasta and wine and a really late check out of 4pm.
The hotel is spotlessly clean. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The room was small, nothing fancy but comfortable. Tea and coffee and toiletries in the room.
We had a problem with the noise of the air conditioning, it was like an aeroplane taking off when on full. It was needed on full as it was pushing 30 degrees. I asked for it to be checked and it was immediately, no messing about. The staff also checked if we could move rooms and while they did this they gave us a complimentary drink so we could wait in comfort. This was a lovely touch.
The bar is a nice environment. We sat outside to have our meal which was very tasty. Bradley served us and right from the start he made us feel at home. He made us lovely drinks and was so cheery we felt very happy. I think he deserves a special thank you for making our evening more enjoyable! Breakfast was good quality and lots of choice, nice to see fresh pastries which other hotels have stopped since covid, little things like that were nice to see.

My initial welcome was excellent despite myself being tired and made to being felt very welcome.

Upon checking in my room I noticed the air conditioning was not working but quickly moved to a new room. 

I had evening food which was ok, just feels awkward walking to your room and then you lose the freshness but in general a good effort considering the epidemic we are going through.

As with breakfast was slightly annoyed as I requested a change of time the evening prior on my second day but this was obviously missed out so had to very quickly get Ready. All in all the breakfast was absolutely delicious, I do look forward to eating in the restaurant moving forwards.

The beds are very comfy with a large tv and good working space on the large desk.

All the staff at the hotel are a great credit with their smiles and their politeness.

We were checked in quickly by a very friendly man and went to our room, it was very clean but smaller than a premier inn room that we had stayed ina few days before. 

We went out for a few drinks in Bristol then came back for a couple in the hotel bar, the bar manager and staff were really accommodating and friendly and really made us feel welcome. On the first night we realised the bed wasn’t particularly comfy and pillows are feather (I believe) which means they deflate into nothing when you lay on them which led to a bad nights sleep. 

On the second night I got some more pillows in the hope it would be comfort but alas they were still hopeless and after a night of tossing and turning I called reception in the middle of the night to get an extra pillow. Now I’m not sure what the receptionist thought I was doing with these extra pillows but he was very cagey and a little rude about giving me another one. 

Overall the service was generally very good but room was not comfortable which let it down ","2","","2020-10-31","2020-10-05","2020-10-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r773237622-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Service: 2","Poor - will not stay again","I don't like to post a poor review. Any hotel can have one problem, but there were too many at this hotel.

We've stayed here a number of times over the years, and I this will be the last. 

The rooms haven't changed much - a bit on the small side but reasonably well equipped. 

It's the approach to Covid-19 that lets it down. We booked in for 3 nights, only to find that there would be no room service. This would be OK, but toiletries, coffee, cups, etc were only provided for a one night stay, meaning we had to call (or visit due to no reply) reception for more.  Not good.

Things got worse for the evening meal. A poorly photocopied menu offering burgers and pizzas should have set alarm bells ringing. As should an empty restaurant at 7:00pm. The pizza was mediocre - dry chicken, dry sauce and too much chilli on a doughy base. Other hotels seem to be able to maintain standards, so why not Hilton? The server also wore a face mask that didn't cover his nose. Not good.

Overall, the hotel seemed short staffed and doing the minimum to get by. Back when this was a Mint hotel, and then a City Inn, you were guaranteed quality food (and an iMac in the room). I appreciate there are Covid-19 guidelines, but this is no excuse for such a fall in standards. Not something one expects from any of the Hilton chain. We stayed in two other hotels during September; they managed to deliver great service and food, including room service, whilst maintaining good Covid-19 procedures.

Finally, checking out was probably the worst I've had. First we had a breakfast charged to the room, which we didn't have. The gent at check-out corrected it. But when I looked at the bill, a £5.55 had appeared. I went back and the gent explained (almost condescendingly) that the removal of the breakfast charge resulted in the balance being less than the guarantee amount that the hotel charged to the card on checking in, resulting in a £5.55 credit being added back. Fine, but all entries were shown as debits and all were coded with no clue as to what the codes were. Sorry, but I expect a bill or invoice to be clear and understandable. Not good, Hilton.","3","","2020-09-30","2020-09-19","2020-09-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r770961428-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

However, what - for me - let the place down, was trying to find it. Not necessarily the hotel's fault but details on the website were scant and the combination of recent road-layout changes, closed off roads, roadworks and traffic volume in Bristol meant it took me more than 45 minutes to find it, driving round in circles.","2","","2020-09-30","2020-09-18","2020-09-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r770849752-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

(Go straight ahead after the ticket barriers and don't exit into station drop off area).  Very modern and clean decor to the hotel but nothing memorable.  Breakfast served in their restaurant which is a plus.  Nice walk through old churchyard opposite will get you to convenience stores, couple of nice pubs and a family Italian restaurant (currently closed).  Five minutes further and you are in the old heart of Bristol-Corn Street, atmospheric Market, Quay restaurants and bars etc.  Good soundproofing in room and aircon means it won't get too hot as windows don;t open very far.  Shower only, no bath.  
Main gripe is that there is no left luggage at the moment due to Covid restrictions....Having arrived by train at 9am I was faced with wheeling my case around Bristol until 3pm check-in!! I would have gone home but fortunately, the duty manager yielded and let me leave my case in an empty office.  Lacking an area to leave luggage is a real nuisance for people using public transport and needs to be addressed by Hilton if they want to welcome tourists back and have properties near train stations where a number of people won't have a car or have no access to left luggage facilities (none at station).","2","","2020-08-31","2020-09-06","2020-09-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r769128882-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The bed was solid , was looking forward to a relaxing bath but that was scuppered when I went to my room to discover there is no bathtub. The fridge was not working had a bottle of water in it for 2 days and I don't even think it dropped a degree . Also the car park is tiny and I think the charge for the parking is a tad astronomical considering the price your charging for a sub standard 4 star Hotel room .
For a 4 star Hotel and the price you pay you would expect a bit more .

The hotel location and amenities are acceptable for the price. 

However I experienced a problem with a colleague coming to my room in the late evening. 

This was aggressively handled (initially), and the policy of the hotel not clear on the issue. 

My colleague was told in no uncertain terms he was a risk of Covid19. Which is odd since I had no health screening on check in . 

DO NOTuse this hotel if you plan late work  meetings or if a colleague needs to collect an item.  

I felt that I was judged by the staff member in question. We resolved this, although the policy still not clear. 

Was made to feel I had done something wrong. Not a nice feeling but will be my only memory of this stay.

At that time it struck me as a fantastic example of an independent smart, contemporary hotel with exemplary standards of service. When Hilton took it over several years ago, I feared the worst. With, it transpires, justification.

Standards at this hotel have since gradually slipped to the point where I am now considering whether to ever visit it again (and I am a Hilton Honors member!).

Parking is now chargeable, at £16 a day. It used to be free for guests when this was the Mint. But there’s worse, much worse. 

I stayed in room 506 and, having returned to the room after dinner out in Bristol, I discovered that the air con/heating system in the room was completely kaput. 

To his credit, one of the staff - David - was quick to attend when I reported it at the front desk. But his solution was not to offer a change of room but to simply wheel a battered small oil radiator into the room. That really isn’t what I was expecting.

In any case, the heater was incapable of heating the room - it was way too small - so I spent a very long night in a very cold room, not at all my idea of a pleasant hotel stay. I’m just pleased that I hadn’t brought my wife on this trip, she would never have let me hear the end of it!

The speed with which the heater was wheeled in to the room suggests this was a very well known issue… why is the room being let out to guests while the heating system is known to be faulty?

Breakfasts here, too, are now an unmitigated disaster. It’s not the fault of the staff, they try their hardest. It’s just that there simply aren’t enough of them to adequately service the number of guests in the hotel. 

Foodstuffs took an absolute age to replenish - after 10 minutes I gave up waiting for the beans container to be refilled and had my full English (utterly bland, bacon as tough as well worn leather) without them. 

The pastry trays, too, were empty when I arrived - and stayed empty until I was about to leave, about 45 minutes later. Staff were often nowhere to be seen at the counter: guests took to reaching over flipping eggs that staff had started cooking!

People were hovering around the food trays for absolutely eons, hoping against hope that trays would be refilled: they waited in vain. The couple next to me had asked for waffles but gave up after 20 minutes. 

Then the two coffee machines gave up - there’s only self-service here now (when it was the Mint there was waiter service). I had to resort to asking the bar staff to get me one. However, I was third in line and by the time I got one and returned to my table the waitress had assumed I had left the restaurant and had cleared my table!

When checking out I was asked if I had enjoyed my stay. The receptionist seemed baffled when I said I had not, down mainly to the lack of heating. “But you got an oil heater, right?”, she queried. “Yes, but it was completely useless, I still froze,” I pointed out. “Oh well, I’m sorry about that,” she said before jovially printing out the bill. And that was that. 

The sad truth is that Hilton has failed to maintain the standards of the previous management at this hotel. Yes, it’s clean and the beds are comfy but there are other basics that guests need to be able to rely on. 

Like effective heating on a cold February night. Like a restaurant with enough staff in it. So I think that this, sadly, is the last year that I’ll be giving the Hilton Garden Inn Bristol my patronage. The Hilton group need to MUCH better than this…

Service: 3","Broken heating; old rooms; stains on walls","The hotel itself was freezing upon entering (my stay was in January). I was given a room that had cold air blowing from the vents. The hotel's heating engineer tried to fix it, which didn't work. I was moved to another room with heating that kept switching off and would not turn back on without manually pressing the button - not really possible at night. I asked for a space heater, but they were all loaned out to other guests. It's particularly annoying because I had just arrived from a 3-hour train delay and had an important interview the next morning. All I needed was time to prepare and a good night's sleep, but instead I had to spend time sorting a heating engineer for Room #1 then moving to Room #2 then freezing all night - I had to wear my winter coat and it was still freezing. Additionally, the rooms are old and there were large stains on the walls. I've had far better stays at budget hotels and would expect more from a city centre Hilton brand - I paid £120 ($160) for one night. The staff are nice and the reception and engineer tried to fix the problem; unfortunately, it didn't work, and this will be my first and last stay.

The restaurant is ok but the food was luke-warm and uninteresting. It's worth getting there early to avoid the crush.

We were a fairly large family group and the bar lounge was simply not big / and comfortable enough to properly relax together.

Checked in on-line, and reserved a room of my choice, which made the actual check-in quick, easy and faultless. 
Acknowledged as a HH Gold Member and offer my benefits, either bonus points or free breakfast, we opted for breakfast. 
Room wasn't as big as other Hilton's we have stayed in, however for a short 3 night stay, it was fine, it had all the amenities you expect from Hilton, fridge, safe, tea/coffee, iron etc. 
Bathroom was quite compact, however again everything you needed. 
Breakfast is a buffet style, and it was superb, you are shown to a table and after that you just help yourself to anything/everything you want. 
Fried and Poached Eggs cooked fresh for you, and there is even the option for an omelette, along with all the usual, fruit juice, water, fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereal, ham, cheese, mackerel, and of course everything you need for a full English. 
Lovely little bar too for a drink after a long day's walk/shopping/sightseeing. 
The best thing about this hotel are the staff, they are all very friendly, and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. 
All in all we had a wonderful stay, and thanks again to all the staff, whether reception, duty managers, restaurant, bar and not to mention the people who looked after our rooms as everything was immaculate and clean. 
Would definitely stay here again.","3","","2020-01-31","2020-01-06","2020-01-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r737316387-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Exceptional service on checking in, and held our bags when we checked out so we could walk to the City Centre and back as had a teatime flight. Breakfast was superb but the scrambled eggs looked a bit undercooked for my liking so I opted for a poached egg which was freshly cooked by the egg man.

Service: 5","Great Hotel in a Superb Location","I stayed here from the 22nd to the 28th of December so I could spend Christmas with my Sister and Brother In Law who live near to Bristol.
Back in February, I was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma which is, unfortunately, a Terminal Cancer and I do not know just how many more Christmases I will be around for so it was really important to me to make this one special and spend it with my loved ones. Before I continue with the review I just want to make it clear that the hotel and hotel staff had no knowledge of my condition other than that I requested a room near the lifts due to mobility issues on my booking.
On arrival, the lady at reception pointed out that she had seen my notes regarding mobility and that the room I had myself chosen on the Hilton Honors Online Check-In service was actually furthest away from the lift and would I like her to see if a room was available that would be closer for me. When I said yes she then found me a room that was one of the very closest to the lifts and gave me a free upgrade to it as it was a Park View room that normally cost extra per night. This was very much appreciated and I am very grateful for this service. The room itself was lovely. Decent size and facilities were all very good. With staying almost a week having a mini-fridge in the room was a big plus point. The 42"" Flat Screen TV was a great feature too although with a limited Freeview selection of channels other than Sky Sports. But still a welcome feature. It would be nice if you could cast your own services to it such as Netflix or Now TV but this isn't something that many hotels currently offer so not something the Hilton, in particular, is failing at.
The Queen size bed was firm and comfy. The air conditioning was very good changing quickly between cooler and hotter when you set it which is something of particular benefit to myself as my temperature rises and drops all the time due to my cancer and treatment.
The bathroom was compact but had a great power shower in it that I really appreciated. Only negative was the ceiling above the shower had peeling paintwork that does need addressing ASAP.
Overall the room was great especially for the price paid. Biggest negative is the internet speed - very slow and I couldn't stream anything on my laptop during my 6 nights here which was a disappointment and limited me to the Freeview selection on the TV.
My room rate included breakfast and this was a real plus. It is a buffet-style breakfast but one of the better ones I have experienced. On arrival in the Recess restaurant each morning you are greeted and just give your room number, you are then given your table and from there help, yourself, a great selection of juices, water, tea and coffee are available to help yourself to in the bar area and the food is laid out well in the restaurant. You can have omelettes and eggs cooked fresh to order and everything else is available to help yourself. The bacon was my favourite here - a very high-quality one, sausages were good, then all the usuals such as mushrooms, scrambled egg, beans, tomatoes, hash browns etc. There is also a good continental selection of pastries, cheese, ham, cold mackeral, fruit and cereals and a selection of different bread to toast. There is also fresh waffle batter and a waffle maker available to cook yourself a fresh waffle and maple syrups, honey and sultanas to add on top. I tried one with Maple Syrup and it was delicious.
The breakfast was a highlight each day.
The staff throughout the hotel were superb, always friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The room was always cleaned and serviced perfectly each day too.
Being a member of the Hilton Honors Scheme I paid just £51 per night for my stay which is incredible value for a hotel of this calibre. The location was 5 minutes walk (for me using a walking stick with limited mobility) to Temple Meads train station and around 10 minutes to Cabot Circus which is the main shopping and leisure area so the location couldn't really be better. 
Unfortunately, I wasn't very well throughout my stay so didn't get to go see the port/docks which had been on my list to do but being in the hotel with such good staff really helped me out. I took advantage of room service most evenings which I found to be a very good value for money and of a very high standard. Every bit of food I tried was delicious and it was very welcome to have a good small plate selection on the room service menu as I struggle to eat full meals with my condition. A special mention to the ice cream which was amazing and only £2 per scoop so a nice 3 scoop serving each night was very much enjoyed. Room service was always delivered in around 15-20mins too. The only thing that could be improved is having some dishes available till later or for 24 hours as the 10 pm cut off is a bit too early at times.
Bar prices were reasonable for drinks and there is a limited selection of cold drinks and snacks available at the standard shop prices in the reception for 24 hours. 
Overall my Christmas at The Hilton Garden Inn was a very good one and I will definitely stay here again on my next visit to Bristol.
It's not perfect but for the price, it's not far off. If the wi-fi speed was better and the paintwork in the bathroom was fixed then I would have given 5 stars for the rooms instead of the 4 I have given.","4","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/6f/34/f2/the-only-real-negative.jpg

The room's cooling/heating fan was disturbingly NOISY and the bed was hard, so if you want a good nights sleep, dont stay here. Also they only have freeview channels on TV so if you're hoping to watch Netflix/Youtube or other streaming apps, get ready to be disappointed. No simple items such as slippers or robe. They provided 1 set of toiletries although we told them there were gonna be 2 people staying in the room. Everything seems to be a hassle, if you want a relaxing stay dont use this hotel!

Main negative is that the (paid) parking is limited in the amount of spaces.

The staff were all pleasant, friendly and helpful including showing us the best route to walk (they didn't recommend the Google maps way). 10min walk to centre, about same to station, and bus stop outside hotel.  Our room was overlooking the park (had upgraded to a quieter room at the back), and was always tidy. There is a bar/restaurant which is nice after a hard day's shopping (!). Overall would definitely recommend, and would use again if ever back in Bristol.

They were friendly and efficient and offered my little boy some sweets that were left over from Halloween the night before. 

Arrived into the room, twin room for myself and my boy (5). TV, iron and board, kettle, tea and coffee. Desk with drawers, fridge and wardrobe. Bathroom was just a shower, no bath but it came with toiletries. Shower was lovely and powerful. 

We couldn't park in the hotel carpark with arriving so late. We parked in the pay and display car park opposite. It was free from 6pm-8am then it was £1 an hour for up to 4 hours max. Not a problem for us, I went and paid £2 to get us through breakfast each morning, beats paying £16 a night for the hotel car park!. 

Breakfast, for a city centre hotel was a bargain at £9.95, my 5 year old ate free. Lots of options, full cooked breakfast, omelette made to order, waffle machine, cereals, fruits, yogurts, meats and pastries. Lots of choice and lovely. 

We didn't spend much time in the hotel as we were attending a family event locally but we will certainly be returning. 

Tip - there are lots of road works to the main road in front of the hotel and they have taken out a roundabout. Sat navs do not like this! Make sure you know where you are going, I took a few wrongs turns on the first night. This is not the hotel's fault, just be aware.

Overall the staff were very pleasant, the room was nice, a little on the small size but okay, breakfast is good and overall location was fine. The real problem for me was the extortionate parking charge. We arrived at 9pm on the Wednesday evening and were informed of a £16 daily parking charge, had I of known this earlier I would never have booked this hotel, but was too late to cancel. In my opinion as guests at a hotel I believe we should be provided free parking, not charged such a high fee regardless whether or not other hotels in the area charge for parking or not. On the day of departure I was given a bill for £48, for 3 days parking. I was livid as i was leaving the hotel at 9am that morning and they were charging me for an additional 12 hrs, what a rip off. My other issue was that on the days we stayed there my car was out for most of the day. These car parking owners are making a huge amount of money for nothing. On departure I complained to the girl on the desk who was very sympathetic and very good. She told me it was a 3rd party company that ran it and there was nothing she could do but did understand my issue. Anyway she offered to deduct one payment of £16 which I accepted so ended up paying £32 instead, reducing the blow slightly. As a result of this I would never stay in a hotel again that charges for parking no matter where. I personally don’t agree with it. Why do hotels not amortise the parking across the cost of the stay and just give guests free parking, no one would know otherwise. Also why is the ground surrounding the hotel run by a 3rd party, strange, they are no doubt paying the hotel for the privilege.","3","","2019-11-30","2019-11-03","2019-11-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r723580116-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Overnight stay on coach trip to Bath and Longleat, great place to stay even longer.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/77/ed/98/spotless-spacious-room.jpg","2019-10-31","2019-10-02","2019-10-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r714841135-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel has small but comfortable rooms. The bed was very firm but not detract from a good nights sleep. What did, however, was that the room was too hot. There was air conditioning in the room but once set it would turn itself off after a while. This resulted in me getting out of bed 4 or 5 times during the night to turn it back on again. 
The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient, except for one of the barmen who messed up our drinks order.
The breakfasts were great with a large selection of delicious offerings. I was particularly impressed with the ‘do it yourself’ waffle maker. However, there were no instructions on how to use the waffle maker which led to a lot of confusion and less than perfect waffles. Also during breakfast, the self service coffee machine was out of order for both of the 2 mornings we were there. The second morning there was a large amount of people in for breakfast as there was a tourist bus load of residents. This led to a large queue for the cramped food area and there appeared to be fewer staff then previous day, which also slowed down the service. This caused my party of 4 some anxiety as we were due to catch an early train home. 
I would have given 5 bubbles but for the above issues. 
However, I would still recommend this hotel and would return if visiting Bristol in the future.","2","","2019-09-30","2019-09-22","2019-09-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r711914882-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It is next to the busy Temple Way, but the rooms at the back ('park view') are quiet (apart from, one night, bottles being crashed into a bin from a nearby pub at 5am).

Check-in was good, with a friendly receptionist.  Our room was compact - not much leeway around the bed - and the air conditioning was quite loud but the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom clean and smart.  Prices were very reasonable - close to budget levels but with a much smarter feel to the place than, say, a Premier Inn.

Breakfast was very good - staff were helpful - and there was a good selection on the buffet with eggs freshly fried at all times and other options frequently replaced.

I've stayed at their properties all over the world at every price point and without fail the experience has been great.  The most impressive thing is the quality of the staff. So professional, well trained, attentive and kind, this has been my experience at every single one. This Hilton is in a great location within 8 minutes walking distance to Temple Meads train station and Bristol itself is a small city (reminds me of my native Boston, Massachusetts) and is more than a 15 minutes walk. Comfortable rooms and as always the bathroom lighting was great and flattering, another thing that I love about Hilton.  My *only* quibble was the harsh lighting in the narrow hallways - it looks like a dormitory hallway. But that is really minor.  The food in the restaurant as others have noted is very good as well.

When the food arrived shortly after I was very pleasantly surprised. We had 4 different sandwiches-egg mayo and rocket on brown, ham salad on white bread, tuma mayo and cucumber on brown and cheese and vegetable chutney on white. All were fabulously fresh and tasty. This was followed by 4 warm soft scones minus the usual bicarb taste with a large dish of clotted cream, fresh strawberries, fresh red grapes and strawberry conserve with a choice of other jams if required. Lastly was 6 large cubes of cake - ginger and lemon, white chocolate and raspberry and toffee cake. All were beautifully fresh, light and tasty.

To top it all off the staff couldn't have been nicer. 

Well done Hilton 10/10 from me. Really impressed and looking forward to my next visit already.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/18/50/b4/c1/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

Then in the morning breakfast was great and the staff member who was on brilliant and great costumer service skills. The thing for me that has really spoiled my stay here is the fact I left some of my property here and went all the way to Bristol to collect it as I was instructed by house keeping that they had it. When I got there they did not have access to the room where it was. I had made a  120 mile round trip and not got my clothes. Despite this I was amicable and excepted this and agreed to them sending my property to me by post. This was on the 20th of may at the time of writing this review it is now the 28th of June. I’ve had no phone calls no emails and my property has not been returned. The hotel hasn’t even offered to comp me for my inconvenience and petrol and travel expenses for the wasted journey in may! I’ve phone again today and been told I will get a call back tomorrow. I suggested some kind of compensation as a good will gesture. Maybe a room for the night to right the wrong and show me that they do no how to provide a good service. I will write a review here to let you know how I got on. I’m not expecting much though.

Overlooks the park.  Great breakfast with lots of choice - eggs, meat, fish, waffle maker, fruit, breads,  mushrooms, hash browns, cereals -  in fact all you could wish for.

Staff were very friendly and helpful.

Great location with a bus-stop outside - frequent buses to the attractions.  Close to Temple Meads Station too.

Ate at the hotwl for dinner and breakfast and both were acceptable hotel food.
The bar had the football on and were happy to keep me stocked up with beer, very friendly team.

Good business choice, but would also make  good weekend break if you cane by train.","1","","2019-05-31","2019-06-03","2019-06-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r678655419-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Hotel short walk from station and walkable to most places in city centre, got the ferry boat back one day when we had walked down to Hotwell from Clifton.Room very good, bed excellent and bathroom really everything we wanted, shower fantastic. The thing that makes this hotel is it’s staff- all really helpful and friendly. Will stay again.

The evening menu is however limited, I was unfortunately tied to a few things and as I was staying for a week had to revisit a dish or two. Food was cooked perfectly, just not a great variety.

We received a warm welcome from Maria (the receptionist) that gave us the best possible overview  about all the hotel services and on what the city can offer us (with an useful map) that allowed us to save so much time, enjoying freely our holidays in Bristol.

If you are looking for a nice restaurant in the nearby, you do not need to go too far! The Restaurant Hotel RECESS is fabulous in terms of service, menu and location! Really recommended!

We also enjoyed the fitness room, it has everything we needed and we were the only ones using it, so it was quiet and fun at the same time!

We are already recommending this hotel to everyone we know and we would love to stay in this hotel again in the future.

The shower was lovely with excellent water pressure. Location wise, it was literally around the corner from the office, but it was also well located for getting into the city centre too. Gym was again small, but had plenty in there to use. My colleague went for breakfast and said it was lovely, and we ate in the hotel the night we arrived.

I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip.  The buffet breakfast is fairly good and some of the meal options for lunch and dinner were great and some a bit ordinary.  My favourites were the Piri Piri Chicken wrap and the British Beef Pie. I wasnt a fan of the crispy salt and pepper squid, a bit bland and not very crispy.

I enjoyed walking around the area local to the hotel.  There is also a gym if you want exercise but the weather isnt good outside.

I would stay here again and recommend it to my colleagues.","1","","2019-03-31","2019-03-20","2019-03-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r659763646-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Booked online, and our payment was rejected 2 times. We tried a 3rd time and didn't get a rejection, in fact got confirmation of this. We got a flight down from Newcastle and arrived just after midnight - in a city we have never been to and shattered from the journey. We walked into reception to be told our reservation had been cancelled and that instead of the £300 we should have paid that they had no more room other than a room that was just over £2,000 for the same amount of time. Needless to say I wasn't very happy and luckily I had printed out my confirmations, where I was still questioned as to why it had been cancelled. Why he was asking me I'm not sure because I had the confirmation and had travelled long enough for them to surely know that this was an error on their own booking system. I was not offered an apology and was reluctantly told that they would offer the 'same' room for the price we should have originally paid. Now, if I had paid £2000 for the room we received I would have been fuming it was disgusting, lights not working and stains on the carpet. Rude staff and was made to feel unwelcome. Definitely would steer people away from any Hilton from now on! Massively let down from this worldwide brand - nothing special and in fact was below par of a premier inn.","0","","2018-08-31","2019-01-05","2019-01-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r643854490-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 1","Not very forthcoming","Don't get me wrong, the hotel itself is very nice. The room I had was spacious and the bed was comfortable. You will hear people slamming doors and talking in the hallways. However, I gave my rating based on what the staff didn't tell me when I checked in. When I checked in I saw there was a restaurant and mentioned that I was hungry and would have to come down to eat after in put my stuff away. There seemed to be a party of some kind going on. I wasn't told anything at the time. However the staff moved me from a 1st floor room to the 2nd floor. I thought that was nice. Then I went down to eat and found out I couldn't eat at the restaurant because it was a private event. I went out to eat then came back to my room. The music was loud even on the 2nd floor. It was 10:00 PM and I called the front desk. I was told the party was going to go on till midnight. They did offer me another room but it was on the 1st floor! That's where the party is. Why would a hotel that had a LOUD party going on till midnight put customers in rooms that the noise from the party would bother you? I can't believe that a ""Hilton"" hotel would do this. I will make sure to not stay in another Hilton hotel while in Europe when this is the way management plans and thinks of its hotel customers. NOT a happy customer","1","","2018-12-31","2018-12-16","2018-12-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r639865776-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Restaurant staff are inefficient and incompetent with arrogant management. They supposedly offer a breakfast and diner deal. No matter how many staff I asked about it I never managed to book it once in 3 weeks. Restaurant staff asked me to check with front desk and front desk said it had nothing to do with them.

There was a bit of confusion when I payed cash and requested a VAT receipt (I was given a restaurant check in lieu of the receipt...), however the issue was promptly and efficiently resolved by the Front Desk, who organised what I needed in an envelope ready to be delivered to my Room. Also worth mentioning the bar tender Gennaro, who was extremely friendly  who was able to make recommendations with good knowledge of the offer available.

Bedroom was large and had everything needed for a business stay. Quite corporate so not a place I would choose for a leisure stay. What looked like a large double bed was two single beds put together, a pet hate of mine.

I initially visited my room to drop off my bag and then went downstairs for dinner. On returning to the room I prepared for bed. Standing by the bed I noticed my foot was wet and looked down to see what looked like the remnants of a vomit spray under me, right by the side of the bed you would most likely use to get into bed. See photo. I tried to convince myself it was coffee or water but it just didn't look like it. It looked like someone had tried to clean it but it was still wet when I arrived and I do think there was a smell from it. Had to wash my feet and then get into bed on other side to avoid stepping in it again. 

I won't be staying here again because of this.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/15/6e/f2/2c/the-wet-patch-which-was.jpg","2018-11-30","2018-11-19","2018-11-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r634303549-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Our hotel room number 132 was really nice and comfortable with tea and coffee facilities, a fridge and a safe. Really clean with plenty of wardrobe and drawer space for all our things. Small but lovely bright bathroom with toiletries and white fluffy towels.
Breakfast was buffet style with everything you could want, and of a good quality, really enjoyed it. Our evening meal was the only negative for us and all on our coach party. We were told we had to be down for our meal by 6pm and when we arrived the staff were dragging tables and chairs around and trying to set tables, it was very chaotic and very noisy and unpleasant. When we eventually were able to queue for our meal with our plates we did not know what food was there, no signs saying what the food was at all. The main meal was some kind of stew, think it was pork but as I say there was no information as to what food was was in the containers we served ourselves. Very poor indeed and the only downside to our trip.","0","","2018-10-31","2018-10-10","2018-10-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r623660504-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Good location, situated about 5 minutes of Temple Meads Station and within about 4 minutes of a large Wetherspoon pub the Knights Templar and quite close to a lot of other restaurants, pubs and cafes. However, I've had warmer receptions on arrival but I don't think they liked it when I questioned how much the parking was, £16, which I was informed was one of the cheapest in Bristol. Personally, and I've found this an ever growing issue, I really dislike finding a good price for a hotel, then finding there is an additional - often quite substantial - cost for parking but it isn't necessarily apparent. Please advertise it up-front and stop blaming the cost on second party car park companies when it's within your boundaries – mini-rant over. Now to the rooms, good standard, with everything you need but like with many chain hotels in a semi-bland way. While the hospitality tray had mostly good quality products, the coffee really, really, wasn't great, it's a shame that I don't drink decaf because that was Rombouts, no biscuits though. The bathroom had good quality toiletries and the towels were good but the toilet area was really quite cramped (it’s as small as it looks) and there wasn't a lot of room at the sink (again the photo says it all). While the shower was plenty big enough, with a door that made entry and exit easy, the pressure wasn't great. I didn't eat, so can't comment on the food and I only had one drink in the bar, which was a half of Stella Cidre for £2.60, which is about what you would expect in a hotel. Check-out was quick and uneventful. My overall rating would be good if that were an option (come on TripAdvisor), because it really was better than average but not to the very good level that I’ve marked it as.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/14/fa/e6/7a/bedroom-5.jpg

The hotel was surrounded by complex one-way roads, we spent more than an hour trying to find a way in but gave up at the end and parked somewhere else. Later found out that the way to drive to the parking lot is by driving to the nearby Novotel, drive through the hotel building (underneath) following their 'parking' sign, then instead of turning right into their underground parking lot just keep driving straight to the end of the road and the entrance to the Hilton parking lot appears on your right. When we arrived at the hotel, the parking lot was full any way (we couldn't have parked even if we found the entrance). This hotel may be convenient for guests walking from Bristol Temple Mead train station but not good for people arriving by car. In the afternoon, there was no water in the entire building (no shower, no toilet in the room, no water even in the toilet in the lobby). We had to use a toilet so went to the Novotel next door and told them that we were staying at Hilton but there was no water in the hotel so would like to use their toilet. They kindly let us use the toilet in their lobby. What a fiasco! The room was really small but clean. The hotel looks likely an upmarket version of Holiday Inn Express. The shower room was tiny. The rooms in this hotel is probably OK for a solo business traveller, but aren't adequate for a couple. The receptionist was arrogant and rude. Breakfast was disappointing. Next time we will stay in Novotel next door.","0","","2018-07-31","2018-08-23","2018-08-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r609647779-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Only thing I could fault this hotel on was the Room Service 
We ordered our evening meal to our room each night and they got the order wrong both times and over charged us both times too.
They did rectify it but still over charged us and couldn't seem to understand the meal deal offer .

Also sometimes use Doubletree but prefer the ambience and good at this hotel by some margin.

It took me a while to realise that there was a shortcut from Temple Meads station (months silly me) but with an exit to the side it is 5 minutes pleasant walk to the hotel. 

There is limited scope for Honours recognition as the rooms are pretty much all the same. I prefer the rooms facing away from the road although they do get the afternoon sun. The bar area though is great, really good, and the food is good value and good quality especially with the daily specials. 

Not sure I would stay here with family, the rooms are nice and clean but quite compact. Perhaps I would choose Doubletree if space was a priority.

Overall though - really good. And the staff are always polite, friendly and welcoming. A small bonus when you are a relatively frequent visitor.

It is walkable into the City Centre or there are a number of buses which stop outside the hotel - whether you walk or bus it is about 15 minutes to the centre.
My check-in and check-out were both efficient and some discrepancies on the final invoice were quickly rectified.
The room is a standard for this type of hotel - everything you need, compact but not squashed together.  There is a good sized desk for working and a comfortable chair at the desk.  The room safe is big enough for a full-size laptop.  Plenty of hanging and drawer space.  Usually tea/coffee hospital tray - Earl Grey tea a nice touch!  Bathroom is basic but good shampoo/shower gel provided.  Limited choice of TV channels; and this is frustrating as so many hotels - including this one - have not retuned following recent Freeview channel changes - so there are even less channels than before!
There are few places in the immediate vicinity to eat so I opted for the in-house restaurant on both evenings.  Food was well prepared and good sized portions.  As with any hotel, the menu offerings are limited, but you could eat here for several nights without repetition.  The breakfast selection was great - including waffle maker, several types of bread and kippers - makes a change from the same ""bacon, sausage and egg buffet"" which is the only choice at so many other hotels.
Why only four stars?  Well the room was very warm and the aircon noisy - Perhaps that is the result of our recent and untypical hot weather.","1","","2018-08-31","2018-08-03","2018-08-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r602363616-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Our room was overlooking the park on the 4th floor. Lovely and quiet and great air con. 

Ate at the hotel in the evening and food was delicious as was breakfast the following morning. Everything piping hot. Lovely. Would I stay here again. Absolutely.

Check in / check out being very efficient.
Rooms are clean comfortable and fit for purpose everything you’d expect from this type of Hotel. In a good location near to Temple Meads and a pleasant 10 minute stroll into the City Centre. 
Due to England playing in the world cup and rather than trying to squeeze into a local bar on a very warm evening we opted for the patio at the rear of the hotel which was showing the match on a outside TV. Surprising the food was very good and the service excellent and all in all we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening.
Breakfast is buffet style with plenty of choice at a good standard situated in the restaurant. Eggs made to order is a nice touch. 

A very pleasant stay - this will always be my preferred Hotel in Bristol

Clean rooms, polite staff, great location and parking is offered. We were also allowed to park for the rest of the day, even after we had checked out which was a massive help.

On reception was Annie who was gregarious and down to earth ,just what you need after tackling Bristol roadworks and traffic.She took time out to ask about our UB40  concert and made our arrival  pleasant. We were offered breakfast for under £10 which is an excellent deal as Hilton  take a pride in their breakfasts. Our room without being large was modern with full natural light and yes our  rooms were indeed next to each other. There is a Weather spoons  within a five   minute walk and the Waterfront is a fifteen minute causal stroll.The breakfast was first class with a good choice including waffles and omelettes made to order.On leaving Dahye on reception continued the vein of excellent customer service giving us all chilled bottles of water for our drive home.

Food delicious with an eye watering choice of fare from cooked to various cold meats, croissants , cheeses etc.

The included breakfast and the morning breakfast staff were the best start to the day that a visitor could hope for.

Breakfast was fantastic and being opened from 6am was lovely as I had to leave for work at 7am. Very central with the train station 10 minute walk away.

The hotel is well located: 5 minutes away from the station and 15 minutes from the shopping centre. Staff members are nice and helpful. Unfortunately, not possible as in other Hilton hotels to order additional towels and pillows so we had to do without. The room is clean indeed but there was a strong smell of Javel when we entered - we quickly opened the small window to make it disappear as quickly as possible. I found our twin room much smaller than on the photos but it was still OK. The bathroom is ridiculously small, and getting hot so quickly that we had to leave its door open when taking a shower. There is no place to put you clothes in there either. There is a large safe in the room, as well as tea/coffee facilities too, and a fridge where you may store your own food/drinks. Our room was facing the back of the hotel, a good choice since the front rooms are on a very busy and noisy street. We generally had a good sleep, if only people coming back late or leaving very early in the morning would mind not slamming doors (especially when it's only 5.30 AM) ... and the doors are slamming very noisily so we were waken up several times. The breakfast is served in the restaurant but there's nobody to welcome you, you just enter and figure out what table is free thanks to a green/red toss placed on them. The buffet is restricted but you can order from the kitchen. I had a cheese and ham omelette which was really tasty. We did not have drinks or dinner there but there are some special offers if you are interested. In summary, it's not as food as a classic Hilton hotel, I would rate it as at 3-start only, but it's more than OK to spend 1 or 2 nights there.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/13/3c/57/87/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

Huge tv, very comfy bed, good solid iron, not a rubbish travel one! Good shower, plenty of towels and shampoo etc, very pleasant staff on reception and breakfast, excellent breakfast, lots of choice.

The hotel is well located. I like the local area. It’s a very short walk to temple meads station. Cross over the road and past some offices and you’re there in around 5mins. In the other direction you can cut across the church yard and there’s a Tesco express, subway and Pret A Manger, about a 3min walk away. 

Check in was easy enough. When I called reception from my room I was told breakfast finished at 9:30am, but they still looked to be serving at 9:45 so unsure. 

I was in Room 317 which was mostly fine. Unfortunately there were a few snags with the room and it wasn’t as clean as it could be. Attached pictures as an example. There was tea on the headboard that someone had spilled. Lots of grime around the shower. It could do with a deep clean and an upgrade. 

Breakfast was fine and the staff were friendly. The selection was standard buffet. 

The hotel was ok and was a standard Hilton. It would be fine if you wanted a good location. I would try somewhere different when in Bristol again though. ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/0a/16/ae/photo2jpg.jpg

When we checked in the receptionist told me the room we had on the 1st floor was small, so she suggested one slightly larger on the 4th floor and took us to both to compare.  I could see her point, so accepted the 4th floor room.  I didn't even look into the bathroom until later when I discovered that it was not an accessible-type bathroom.  At this point it didn't seem worth the hassle of changing rooms.  I have since decided that this hotel probably doesn't have any accessible rooms, and that all rooms are probably quite small.  We did, however have a nice view of Temple Gardens.  The best thing this hotel has going for it is their staff.  All unfailingly friendly and eager to help.  The location is excellent, most things in walking distance, or a convenient bus stop is outside the hotel if that is needed.  Breakfast is the usual buffet-type, with do-it-yourself toaster, waffle iron and coffee/tea.  On the whole it was a pleasant stay, but I did miss that accessible room.","1","","2018-04-30","2018-04-22","2018-04-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r574871752-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

(If I was super picky I think you could add some biscuits for the early morning tea!) The rooms facing the Templemead Garden had the best view. Back of the hotel. We looked over the road but there was no traffic noise/partying people whatsoever. My only niggle is the flashing green light on the heating knob. Drove my daughter crazy. We've had similar problems in other top hotels with the exit/fire signs. They are bright neon and keep you awake. Not sure what anyone can do about this as fire exits etc have to be super safe. We had dinner at the hotel with a full bar. The greeter/restaurant manager was French and extremely proficient. We ate pangaeus fish which we hadn't tried before and was delicious. The cheese cake was excellent. Afterwards reception drew us a helpful map and we ventured out to the harbour side. Utterly charming and I bet it rocks on the W/E and during the summer. So pretty! To do this just head out the back entrance...straight through the park, past the church, turn right. (Tesco Express 2 mins!) then keep going. River/harbour is on your left. You can walk all the way around and then back over another bridge to the hotel. Walk off all that cheese cake! There's no problems for ladies walking alone at night. We felt entirely safe. The sheets were finest cotton and in the morning the breakfast rivalled Hotel du Vin. Fresh fruit salad, eggs any way, full English, healthy muesli, croissants....smoked mackerel....excellent coffee machine. Before we left we also helped ourselves to coffee to go....in take away cups. Another mention to the gym and the computers in reception and excellent Wifi. Also the wonderful staff who 100 % want to please you. The house keeping lady beamed at us and was so happy when we said what a lovely clean room we had. I would think this is a wonderful hotel for business people but also for tourists at the W/E. We will definitely be staying here again! I've never felt so welcome or so relaxed!","0","","2018-04-30","2018-04-09","2018-04-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r572247118-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Just a 10 minute walk from some of the best restaurants in Bristol. The parking is expensive at £16 per night but in this location it's worth it. The room is small but very pleasant it has a nice comfy double bed. The room however is very hot! We slept without covers because of this.

On arrival we managed to get a space in the very small car park, it's £16 per night which I personally think is a bit extortionate. The staff were lovely and friendly on check in and made everything really easy. The hotel in central and really close to a Tesco / Pub / Subway etc so I wouldn't recommend buying food at the hotel because it's expensive for what it is. The room was clean and tidy. The bed was comfortable, but the room was so hot, even with the weather being cold and raining outside. We were on the road side of the hotel and it was quiet but not a very nice view. Can't fault the breakfast though, lots of choice from the buffet and easy to order anything particular you wanted. Again really lovely staff serving and the check out was painless.","0","","2018-04-30","2018-04-04","2018-04-04","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r570974165-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

","We arrived on the Saturday of Easter weekend at about 3.30pm after a busy day shopping and travelling up from Plymouth. On arrival the car park was full but we were told we could leave our cars on the cross hatchings down the side of the hotel. Our room wasn’t ready so were given a complimentary drink in the bar. Once we got to the room it was clean and tidy, if a little small side. We did however have a lovely view of the Temple Garden. The room was incredibly warm and the air conditioning was very noisy. Very problematic at night when the window only opens a small amount. The bed was also rock solid. I love a firm mattress, but this was even too firm for me. 

The location was perfect for us, in the evening we took the short 15 minute walk to the centre of Bristol. Ideal if you were going by train as it’s a stone throw away from the station. 

Beware if you do drive as there is roadworks on the major route to the hotel and a diversion in place. There is also a £17 charge for parking overnight. 

Breakfast was plentiful, tasty and varied for individual tastes.  Check out was quick and easy the following morning. Staff all very pleasant.  Also considering the hotel was full I heard nothing throughout the night from other guests.

Small room but perfectly formed with shower. I was on the 4th floor. It was very warm and the air conditioning was slightly noisy. Love fresh air but window only opened a crack. 
Very polite and pleasant staff who were also very efficient.  
I ate in the restaurant and ordered the steak that was rather pricy at £21 for an 8oz sirloin. Unfortunately my rare was cooked to medium so I sent it back to which a new one was returned cooked to perfection. Joined by a friend the meal came to a pricy £85 but it was convenient. 
Be warned parking £16 a day where as the Hilton double tree 500 or so yards away has free parking. 
In summary, says what it is on the tin and delivers a restful stay without the frills. Good location for centre activities.

Our bedroom was promised to have a good view but instead we were looking into an old fashioned office block. The room itself was cozy and clean and it had very good housekeeping and room service. 

The facilities is a Gym and a safe car park. If you are going to attractions then the number 8 bus is directly outside the Hotel and takes you to Bristol Zoo.

However eating Halal or vegetarian food the choice of breakfast was a bit suffering and boring with no vegetarian sausages or choices and that is the only real let down. And because of the room fan it continues to blow stale air around the room, you can turn it off but at night during none-hot weather you simply get too cold as not enough is provided to stay warm.

I have seen much better Hotels and I have seen much worse. The only reason I didn't rate this Hotel at average is because of its superb location.","0","","2018-03-31","2018-04-01","2018-04-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r570119472-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We stayed two nights.This hotel is a short walk to the train station which was great for us. 

Arrived at the hotel and greeted by the lovely reception staff very friendly and helpful. We had checked in online before hand which made the process quicker. 

We stayed on the 4th floor over looking the main road. The rooms where quite and has very little noise from outside. Our room was spacious.  We booked a queen room but was a little upset due to the beds been two individual beds pushed together, this had a crease down the middle. The room was very warm and was difficult to keep at a cooler temperature. 

We had breakfast here both days which was great. Good selection of food and very attentive waiting staff. Breakfast was busy both days but no issues for the hotel. We used the bar which again staff very attentive and friendly. The bar prices are also very reasonable and no different to the town centre.

We had a great stay at the hotel and will be looking at booking the hotel next year for Cheltenham.

Approaching the hotel, you have to do a little loop - go past the building (on your left), then there are signs for you to turn left, straight on, right and then left to go around the back of the building and into the car park. The car park is £15 pounds and you need a ticket if you want to exit and re-enter. The hotel itself is very clean, well-maintained and the staff were welcoming and professional. As gold Hilton members, we could choose from either a free breakfast or a boost of points which was lovely. Breakfast was very good - lots of choices, from a full English to fruit, waffles, and cereal. The room itself was on the fourth floor; compact but with everything you need, including a little fridge. Even though the bed was quite new, it made lots of noise whilst getting into it. Apart from that, it was a lovely hotel.","0","","2018-03-31","2018-03-02","2018-03-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r563682137-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We ended up outside a Witherspoon’s, rang the hotel and was told to put ‘Temple Rose Street’ into the Satnav, which took us to the rear of the hotel.
Parking is £16 for 24 hours, which isn’t extortionate for city centre secure parking.
We were in room 430, with a queen sized double bed. The tea/coffee making facilities weren’t exactly generous, and the bathroom toiletries weren’t the greatest I’ve ever seen. The bed was comfortable and the room itself was quiet throughout the night.
We used the fitness centre the next morning (24 hour access with your room key) which was basic but adequate.
The highlight of the stay was the breakfast which was excellent. Huge range of food catering for all styles of breakfast and polite efficient service.
The front of house staff were cheery and helpful and I would definitely stay again if in the area.

The only downside is that the car park is tiny and it got to the point where some cars were blocking other cars in. You also have to pay £16 per day for parking which I feel is a bit high considering you are paying to stay in the hotel anyway and it is the hotels own car park.

Nearly every surrounding street is either closed or have extensive roadworks going on, and although I except that this isn't the hotels fault, a simple email explaining this and a small map detailing how to find the hotel would have been helpful!! Upon eventual arrival, we parked in the fairly small carpark. Only to discover that the hotel charges £16 per night to park. Personally we felt that this was too expensive! We feel that the hotel should offer ""free parking"" as an incentive to stay here as opposed to arguably better nearby hotels with no parking facilities?? I would also like to point out, that when we received our final bill, the hotel had tried to charge us twice for the carparking! Check your final invoices carefully!! The rooms are average/ acceptable. Furniture looks like it's from IKEA and had definitely seen better days, same for the carpet. Bathroom small but functionable. Mattress was too hard, I had a terrible sleep here. The breakfast service is a nightmare. Bizarre layout. Not enough room. Very long queues. No plates/ bowls available and finally given a very hot bowl for my cold fruit salad! Felt rushed as our plates were removed the minute we finished our food. Now for the good points. We had a lovely view overlooking the park behind the hotel. 5th floor. It was also quiet. The reception staff were lovely and friendly. The same for the bar/ evening restaurant staff. It's fairly central, ten minute walk into town. I forgot to mention, I have never ever stayed in a 4* hotel, and not had biscuits on the tea tray, until now.

The rooms are smaller than at the Doubletree, but I did expect that, given the lower room rate.

This hotel is an excellent 4 star establishment, and is extremely well run by a management team and staff who seem to care a great deal about customer satisfaction.
Every member of staff made eye contact and said hello - even when passing in the corridor. That's a really good sign.
The house keeping was outstanding. Our room was perfectly prepared, spotless and very comfortable. It wasn't huge but I was in Bristol to see errr... Bristol, not spend hours in a hotel bedroom.
Breakfast offered a wide range of choices and was excellently presented and prepared. I enjoyed it hugely.

What isn't so good is that the showers water on occasion stops and a colleague complained that the shower in their room was occasionally cold. I found the heating barely acceptable with the need to have the thermostat permanently set to maximum, the setting left by the previous occupant.

Breakfast has a really good selection, but again was not very hot on all 3 mornings. We did complain and the waiter did report our complaint to the kitchen, even checking with us the following morning. It was a little better but still not hot. Even the porridge was only warm. We did not eat in the hotel in the evening partly because of our breakfast experience and partly because of the TripAdvisor rating for the restaurant.

I would have forgiven the issues with the room and given a much higher rating if only the breakfast had been sorted.","0","","2018-01-31","2018-01-20","2018-01-20","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r555016878-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Check in at the Hilton Garden Inn was swift, my status was recognised and I was given two bottles of water.

We got a room with a partial view of the park. The room is of a fair size, the bathroom had a standalone shower  and Peter Thomas Roth toiletries.

The compact room had a flat screen tv on the wall, tea and coffee making facilities, a safe, even an ironing board and iron.

Parking at the hotel has extra charges, if you want to exit just go to the reception and ask for slip which the barrier reads when you leave the car park.

We had breakfast included with our room. I thought it was rather good gnerally, we had made to order omelettes, croissants, we could make our own waffles.

I did think the juices tasted cheap and despite having a fancy coffee machine the coffee etc was rather bad being watery.

However this was a good value hotel with the Hilton brand. We walked it to the city centre from the hotel.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/e0/aa/4b/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

Food was as good as what you would get in wetherspoons across the road, curry was watery but I was starving so I ate it. Plates cleared and no offer of drinks or desserts. Half an hour later when we asked he said to order in next 5 minutes the kitchen was closed. Just got the feeling are table of 6 in an empty restaurant was a hassle for him. 

Check out fine 

Directions given by staff awful.i don't know the area have a standard line on how to get the bus to airport. 3 different staff gave 3 different directions to my group on how to get there yes it may be 2 sides of   a square but just have a set line that will stop the doubt.

The majority of our trip was fantstic and based on the service of the team, the cleanliness, the hotel amenities and he location this hotel would get a thumbs up.  
The room itself was nothing special, just your standard hotel room. This is what we expected so again no issue at all. 

Unfortunately we were let down by the main event, sleeping! The mattress was well used and was a little difficult to get comfortable due to the dips and the pillows were a huge disappointment.  After the first night I changed my pillows and thought I’d give it another go. These pillows were equally as poor. As this was our last night in the hotel we had no need to request a mattress an pillow change we just went home more tired than what we arrived.   

I’m not sure if we were unlucky and got the worst mattress and pillows in the hotel, but based on my trip I wouldn’t be returning to this hotel in a hurry. 
The main purpose of a hotel is a comfy bed to sleep in and for almost £270 for two nights this should be an absolute given.

We had read about the expensive parking, so we parked close by and it only cost us £4 for the weekend, so do your homework. Our deal didn't have breakfast either as again I thought the cost rather high, so went off to find our own.

Air con was rather noisy so glad it was November and cold, so didn't need it, but would have struggled to sleep with the level of noise it makes.

Lots of noise from corridor too at times, so sound proofing could be better addressed - I carry ear plugs at all times so I managed to get a good night's sleep. The reception desk area is a little echoey, and the desk staff soft spoken, so those suffering from hard of hearing made it a bit difficult.

Room is decent (although odd chair and sharp edged glass top desk can make finishing off some work in there after hours less than ideal).

Breakfast OK (mediocre in all areas but it's a cheap hotel buffet breakfast so that's average) 

Staff both friendly and helpful (this isn't as standard as you might assume)

Food in the restaurant is decent and the home made scotch egg was good. Avoid the burger but basically everything else is pretty good.

Cocktails OK (decent on expenses but not so much on your own money). 

WIFI good speed (which was nice)

Checkin/check out has always been painless.

The rooms have pretty much everything you would need and, despite being on the small side, work pretty well.  Breakfast is much as you would expect with a standard buffet-style layout.

The parking rather lets this hotel down.  The car park is small and clearly no attempt has been made to provide parking for everyone who is likely to need it.  That would be a little irritating but it is fair to say that there are other car parks nearby and I guess it is not uncommon for a city centre hotel.  

What is far more annoying is how inconsiderate some hotel users seem to be.  The car park has clearly marked spaces along one side of the narrow car park.  However, numerous drivers took it upon themselves to park opposite these spaces making it extremely tricky for cars parked in the genuine spaces to actually get out of their space.  I am disappointed that the hotel seemed to ignore the behaviour of these drivers leaving the car park to be something of a free for all. 

It's a shame because the hotel was fine - maybe they could consider a better way to deal with drivers who think it is OK for them to park where they choose rather than in the clearly marked spaces?","3","","2017-10-31","2017-10-22","2017-10-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r535075715-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The location is very good, a short walk from the main train station and the main shopping centre. Very good location indeed. We arrived and were greeted by the smiling faces of the friendly reception staff. Good start. We got our room key and went up to the room, which was the 'King Suite' - which turned out to be two beds pushed together to form a big bed. The hotel advert describes this as a 'King size bed' but it isn't. This became apparent when my lover and I were in the middle of enjoying some hotel rumpy pumpy and I found myself sliding down between the two adjoining mattresses. A slight irritation, but fortunately my performance did not suffer. 

The hotel room was clean, but by golly gosh it was VERY hot. We had the air con on at the coolest setting, but that did not make much of a difference to the sweltering heat. The fact the window only opens 2 inches (I assume to deter would-be suicidal types and/or rock n rollers who want to hurl furniture into the car park below) did not make life any easier. It was incredibly warm and slightly uncomfortable. That said, I can't fault the cleanliness of the hotel room. The main public areas of the hotel was also very clean, apart from one instance. By the lift there was a tray with used plates, glasses, cutlery and the remains of what looked like another guests' breakfast left on the floor. This was there upon our arrival at 3pm, and still there when we returned from a day of gallivanting in Bristol centre at 11pm. Aside from that however it was an ideal little stay. 

All in all I'd recommend the hotel to anyone wanting a hotel with a good location, and who isn't too anal about the little things like abandoned food trays in the corridors. This hotel is also ideal for anyone who's natural body temperature is at a constant cool level..like that of a fish or some kind of ocean dwelling crustation.","1","","2017-09-30","2017-10-03","2017-10-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r529545964-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Each day the rooms are immaculately cleaned and the food in the restaurant is possibly the best I've eaten in Bristol. They like to mix the menu up with their weekly specials so check them out.

The restaurant staff are especially helpful. They are always welcoming when I arrive back from a hard day at work. They take they time to get to know their guests and a special shout out to Sean/Shaun and Maria, who always go that extra mile to make sure everything is great. Seriously ask Maria to make you a cocktail ;) 

Literally the best Hotel in Bristol and having stayed in the other Hiltons in the city this is easily the most relaxed, friendly and clean. 

Its a short walk to all areas of the city centre and very easy access to the motorways and Temple Meads if you work outside the centre.

Also I work in IT, high speed free wifi = bliss!!","0","","2017-09-30","2017-09-28","2017-09-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r528103336-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The location is very good if you need to be in central Bristol.  It is a short walk from Temple Meads Station, and a short stroll to the very attractive waterfront area with it's numerous restaurants and bars.  It is a very new and modern looking hotel, and someone had the sense to provide some outside space to sit adjacent to the restaurant on sunny days.
The service provided by Annie at check in was exceptional, and all the other staff we encountered during our stay there were very friendly, efficient and helpful.  The hotel had clearly trained it's staff very, very well.
The bedroom was small but had all the necessary features.  The standard rooms had welcome touches like a mini fridge and a window that actually opens.  Though the mattress felt a little hard it was still very comfortable.
The breakfast buffet was excellent, the warm bread loaves that were provided were particularly exceptional.  A good selection of fresh fruit, fresh pastries, good quality hot items and a cooked to order egg station added to the overall ambience.  A 2nd coffee machine would be good to avoid the queues.
I hope we get to stay in this hotel again, I would be a very happy repeat visitor.","0","","2017-09-30","2017-09-14","2017-09-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r524245495-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Assuming the hotels were much the same we weren't expecting much. The hotel is in a great location, just a 15 minute walk from the old city and harbour. The reception area was light and spacious and the restaurant located just off it. We headed to our room on the 4th floor, a reasonable size and well furnished with a nice en suite. The room was absolutely spotless. Always nice to have Aircon, and we needed it on the night we stayed as it had been a warm day. We slept well in the comfortable bed. In the morning we headed down for breakfast, which was a buffet affair. It really was excellent, one of the best buffet breakfasts I've had; to my delight there were large slices of black pudding under one of the heavy cloches! The waiting staff were pleasant and attentive. An enjoyable stay in a very good hotel.

One tiny 'bottle' of conditioner (but no shampoo) and two tiny 'bottles' of body conditioner (who even uses those!).  No bar of soap by the basin when washing your hands.  
Also, I heard this strange clicking noise during the night which I thought was perhaps the heating/air con but in the morning I noticed the kettle was boiling hot and completely empty of water.

The room was a good size and well equipped with a large wardrobe, an iron and board, tea and coffee facilities and a modern flat screen TV (a good sized TV!). The bed was a little hard for my liking, but that's just a personal thing.
Location is great for walking to tourist attractions; it's very close to Temple Meads train station too, so avoid the traffic and take the train.
Only downside (there's always one) - if you take your car and you use the hotel car park, prepare to be removing sticky tree sap from it. The trees are unavoidable and your car will be covered, and I mean completely covered, in this awful goo.
But, despite the goo, I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short break or a business stay.

Service: 2","Too Much Hassle","We chose this hotel because of its close proximity to Bristol Temple Meads railway station.  After check in we went to the restaurant for a light lunch.  Although we were the only people eating at the time service was slow.  My Caesar salad was very ordinary.  I usually have Parmesan cheese in a Caesar salad but I did not detect any in this salad which was just about acceptable.  When we went to pay there was no one around to receive payment and that was another unnecessary wait.

We were there for two nights. After the first night I straightened the bed and put my night dress under my pillow.  When I went to put it on in the evening it had disappeared.  It turned up in the laundry room!  It had been removed by the housekeeping staff.

On the final morning when I got the bill there were many entries for alcohol that I had not ordered.  The offending items were removed but I would have hoped that there were procedures in place to prevent that happening.

The good news is that the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable.

I might possibly stay there again because the hotel is in a good location and was clean and comfortable.  If I did stay I would pay cash for my accommodation and not leave credit card details.  I would avoid the restaurant.

The rooms although clean are small and cramped.  People who are on the large side might not feel comfortable here.

When I booked the room I was asked if there were any special requests.  I requested a room with a bath.  It was only after I was given my room key that I was told that none of the rooms had a bath.  I dislike showers and had to put up with the situation.  The shower was hot and efficient.  The shower cubicle was of a reasonable size but the rest of the shower room was cramped.  If you would describe yourself as of large stature this shower room may not suit your purpose.","0","","2017-08-31","2017-08-07","2017-08-07","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r509690761-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 3","Nice Modern Hotel - Terrible Food Service in Restuarant **Avoid Eating There**","We went to Bristol for my wife's birthday while the harbour festival 2017 was on. We found the hotel at the last minute. Its a lovely modern hotel - close to the train station, shops and harbour, and all within a 10 minutes walk, so was perfect for us.

On my wife's birthday after shopping and meeting up with friends we decided to have a meal in the hotel restaurant because its looked modern and nice.
The restaurant is called reese's and to all future guests/diners i'd ** ""avoid at all cost""**. The food is alright don't get me wrong, but it took 2 hours to order and eat steak & chips, and some cocktails in a empty restaurant.
First of all my wife's is Celiac, but the menu in the room said it can cater for her. The clearly untrained waitress didn't know what Celiac was, let alone a whiskey sours. But she said the manager had a tablet that shows alleges to order from. While waiting 30 minutes for the tablet from the manager (which he never brought over), i got a whiskey not a whiskey sour. Learn to listen and take a drinks order.
Finally the shifty manager turned up to take our order (with no tablet) and clearly wasn't listening as i ordered the lamb and got the steak. We remembered him from earlier as the man who barged through us as we entered the restaurant. We should of know then this was going to be a bad experience. 
10 minutes before our food arrived (1hr 20 minutes after sitting down), the food finally turned up. We had basically finishing our steak & chips, and were still waiting for the drinks to arrive when my wife had to get up and ask again for the drinks. Joke!!!
I wouldn't recommend this restaurant especially on a quiet fairly empty Saturday evening- slow service, untrained staff that don't pay attention and an unhelpful manager that can't lead his staff to serve his customers/guests.
like i said **avoid avoid avoid**","0","","2017-07-31","2017-08-05","2017-08-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r509025531-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 3","Good stay at Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre with my mum","Last month, my mum came to stay with me for a few days and we decided to go to Bristol for a couple of days. We stayed at Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre.

Location:
Hilton Garden Inn Bristol hotel is located 15 minutes walk from the Bristol train station in a quiet business area. In addition, it is only 5 minutes from Temple Meads Station and 10-minutes train ride from Bath Spa. The shopping centre is located barely 5 min away so if you are planning a bit of retail therapy then look no further. 

Facilities:
Hilton Garden Inn Hotel has a 24-hours reception, baggage storage room, restaurant and a room service. Wi-Fi is available at no extra charge. The fitness center is open 24 hours a day. The Races reception serves a nice breakfast to start your day with. During the evening you can choose from a range of International and British dishes but I wasn’t impressed with their quality.
The hotel has 2 meeting rooms that can host a conference or private event for up to 60 guests and if you wish to make your stay extra special then you can request to stay in one of the rooms with a picturesque view of Temple Gardens.

Room:
We stayed in a Queen Guest Room had a nice, contemporary décor.
Our room had a mini-fridge, work desk and a chair. I addition, there was a large 32-inch LCD TV. The bed which was comfortable and easy to fell asleep in.
The bathroom was very small. Some basic toiletries were provided.

Overall:
Hilton Garden Inn Bristol hotel has simple yet comfortable facilities in addition to great location. I would recommend it to anyone who travels to Bristol on business or for pleasure.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/21/80/96/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

Once sorted we were asked if we wanted tea first so we're brought hot water with our afternoon tea being brought out around 30 mins later. Had to query ours as we'd requested plain sandwiches with no butter. They took them away and returned a short while later with what we'd requested. We also had to request cream for our scones.

Despite these few hiccups, afternoon tea was lovely, probably one of the better ones we've had and staff were very helpful.

Hotel is also great location with only a 10 min walk into the town. Only downfall was the car park was a little short of spaces and quite small.

As the weather was so bad we decided to eat at the hotel that night, wasn't overly busy which makes sense as to why there was only 1 waitress, she did her best but trying to catch her attention to get another drink and more water was so frustrating, almost went to go back to the room for some. 

When we were leaving and went to check out we handed the keys and card back to a different receptionist and just waited, never asked how our stay was , she just said yeh it's done and that's it. Disappointing considering the first receptionist we spoke to was so friendly and bubbly.

Service: 5","Nice stay in Bristol","I stayed here in May 2017 while on a solo trip through the U.K. I selected this hotel in part due to the location to the Temple Meads train station, though ironically, I didn't end up taking the train at all from Bristol.

Even before I arrived at the hotel, I had interaction with the staff and that good experience continued on-site. Although I was slightly early for check-in, I was greeted warmly and given my key. I had a double room on the side of the hotel that looks out towards the Temple Garden, which was nice and quiet. Entering the room, there was a small bath to the right. Moving further into the room, there was a small desk and office chair next to the window, a very firm queen bed, and a stand-alone wardrobe that contained the safe and clothes hanging space. The bed had decent pillows and the linen felt clean and refresh. While there was AC/heat, the window opened wide enough to provide fresh air; and so I never used the heating/cooling system. There were plenty of standard electrical outlets that were easy to reach both near the desk and at the bedsides.

The bathroom was small but since I was by myself, it was perfectly serviceable for one. (It might be tight for two with a lot of product). The shower was also a bit tight but once inside and the door closed, there was enough room to move around. The water pressure was good and the temperature control didn't drift too much. The towels were amazing, large and fluffy. The bath amenities were Peter Thomas Roth. 

The in-room wifi was relatively fast. I ate in the restaurant one night and was impressed with the friendly staff and decent food. To get to the city center, it was just a short walk (less than 5 minutes for me). There was also a Tesco Express nearby, along with a few pubs, cafes, and coffee shops. I walked around the area in the evening and never felt uncomfortable as a solo female. 

All in all, I was very pleased with my stay and definitely would recommend this hotel.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/86/96/8f/double-room.jpg

We were really pleased with our room, which was on the small side but modern and very clean, clearly designed towards the business traveler. Would have liked to have a few coat hooks by the door though. Our room had a partial view to the park and this meant no road noise at night, which was a plus. The bathroom was compact but well-designed with a great shower and plenty of fluffy towels.
Friendly helpful front desk staff fixed some small issues for us and made time for questions.
The immediate area is quiet on weekends as it's mainly office buildings, but there are a couple of pubs and shops within a few minutes walk if you don't feel like wandering too far. You can also easily walk into Bristol center, or there are plenty of buses around the hotel. Bristol Flyer airport bus stop is conveniently around the corner as well.
Overall, a comfortable and reliable option with a good price tag.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/6d/ab/40/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg","2017-05-31","2017-05-30","2017-05-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r489048110-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is well kept and spotless. Our double room was nice, basic but nonetheless suited us perfectly. The fridge in the room wasn't working however staff at the hotel ensured it was fixed promptly. The staff are very friendly, young lady called Patricia helped us with a map to direct us to where the nice bars and restaurants were. Bristol is lovely and I'd definitely return to this hotel again. The only drawback is that breakfast is rather pricey however I feel that this is down to the Hilton itself rather than the individual establishment.

The staff could not have been more helpful, all of the people that I spoke to were friendly and would try to solve any issue.

The room that we were given had disabled access with wet room and was on the ground floor. The restaurant was also on the ground floor so access was not an issue at all.

The towels were soft and fluffy. The television was large and the tea and coffee facilities provided Twinings tea.

However, the room itself was tiny with a 4ft 6 bed. The bed itself was hard and the pillows equally so. Needless to say the two nights spent were not the best sleeps. The entrance to the room was just passed a fire door which opened the wrong way, in my opinion, so when I exited the room I then had to reverse to get into the corridor. The breakfast was okay but the continental selection was meagre.

At £125 a night for B&B I thought it was overpriced.  

Had there been a Premier Inn near to Temple Meads Railway Station I would have preferred to stay there!","0","","2017-05-31","2017-05-25","2017-05-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r487711600-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Staff were pleasant and helpful and the room, although small, was clean and comfortable.  The only issue I had was that my air conditioning turned itself off after about 15 minutes but as it wasn't really hot outside that wasn't a huge issue.

The fitness room is small but nice, although it was very hot in there.

The restaurant is good, I had a lovely steak, and breakfast was a good and varied selection, and served from 06:00, which was a bonus.

All in all, a very good hotel and I would definitely stay again.","1","","2017-05-31","2017-05-19","2017-05-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r485665183-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was very clean and fresh although not particularly spacious which I expected in a city hotel, this was only highlighted by a huge chair which got in the way a few times and could not be moved easily.  

The bed was quite firm, for me not a problem but my friend struggled with her back although we both had a reasonable nights sleep, the air conditioning was left on overnight and we were able to sleep as it is a constant dim hum rather than some of the louder units.  In the morning we were horn pleasantly surprised that although we heard people chatting as they walked down the corridor we were not woken early with doors banging which can sometimes be the case.

We did not have breakfast the following morning however the selection looked good in the bright restaurant area.","0","","2017-05-31","2017-05-16","2017-05-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r484543735-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel itself was lovely and clean, as well as being bright and airy. The rooms were light and modern, and of a medium size, perfect for two. A selection on teas and coffee's were available in the room, as well as bathroom products.

We didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast which was lovely; the restaurant at breakfast was packed, and offered a lovely selection of breakfast foods, ranging from the classic full English, to pastries and waffles, to fresh fruits and cereals. I would definitely recommend adding breakfast to your stay, especially on the weekend as service doesn't finish until 11:00am, perfect for a lie-in or after a heavy night.","0","","2017-04-30","2017-05-04","2017-05-04","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r481636527-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It was only a 5 min walk towards town from the station so easy to get to.  Although it is on a main road heading into town if you had a room at the back and used the rear entrance which leads out onto temple park then you would not realise where you were.  The rooms very great and very clean with everything you could want for your stay including hair dryer, safe, fridge, iron etc.  The only downside was that we only had a shower in the bathroom and not a bath but this really didn't matter to us.  You could even open a small side window to get some air which is unusual these days.  I have stayed in other hotels in the city centre before but would definitely stay here again.","0","","2017-05-31","2017-05-01","2017-04-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r480418948-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We arrived before check in time and they kindly allowed us to leave our bags as we headed off into the city. When we checked in it was swift and effortless and off we went to our room.  

The room was clean and tidy, bathroom was compact but had what was needed. Good TV a and air con made the room nice and cool, well cold actually much to the disgust of my girlfriend !! So she turned it up. 

The reception called a taxi for us when we headed to the show and it appeared within a few minutes. 

We stayed on a dinner, bed and breakfast deal. When we went for evening meal it was early and we were very well looked after. The food was very nice, menu doesn't have lots to choose fm but what we had was top quality.  

Breakfast this morning ran till 11 so no need to be up to early. I have to say the selection was amazing, they even had a waffle machine. 

Over all our stay was really nice, god room, quality food and most importantly helpful, efficient and friendly staff. Top marks indeed.

We had a garden view room, which was very nice and quiet.  We had dinner at the hotel our first night which was very good and most reasonable.

The room was kept immaculately clean, was well equipped and the bed was extremely comfortable. We slept really well and were not disturbed by external noise at all. The shower was a good size and powerful with plenty of hot water.
We stayed on B&B rate and were impressed with the breakfasts, they were self service with a good choice of good quality cooked or cold items. 
We also ate at the City Cafe on two evenings and the food was reasonably priced and beautifully cooked, a real treat.

The king-size bed was infact two wide single mattresses (as usual at large hotels) but the seam was not particularly noticable so this was okay but annoying when you pay extra for a ""king-size bed"".

The staff were helpful and the car parking was very reasonable in comparison to surrounding car parks, they are also flexible with car parking and day parking does not seem to cost money, only overnight which is great if you want to continue exploring after check-out.

As Bristol has so many great restaurants we did not eat at the hotel so I cannot comment here, I stay at many hotels and generally I find rooms to be small but this will always be the case with large purpose-built hotels such as this Hilton. 

My girlfriend was very happy with our Valentines trip so I can definitely recommend this hotel for a quiet weekend away with your partner, the room was also well set-up for business trips with a desk facing out of the window and a decent office chair. I will probably stay elsewhere if I visit again but this is just my preference as I am always curious as to what else is available.

Overall I was very pleased with our stay and the price was good considering it was such a busy weekend, my girlfriend was happy which was the main point for me as I work abroad a lot so hotel stays are not too special to me.","0","","2017-02-28","2017-04-01","2017-04-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r471810703-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Rooms clean and adequately furnished for business or leisure use includes fridge.

We were conference delegates and returned to hotel to check in around 11pm. The night porter was very efficient and suggested we pre-paid for parking so that could post receipt under door to speed up checkout process as our company had booked and paid via Expedia. When issuing the room cards he expressly told us breakfast was included with our package even commenting it was unusual for breakfast to be included..... After a full on day my colleague and I took up the included breakfast, were welcomed room numbers taken and seated.To be honest due to building works it was not ideal the noise of drilling and sanding filled the air thank God we didn't have hangovers I thought. We had a few basics from the buffet as both had meetings, we noted other guests who hadn't got inclusive breakfast were told to go and pay at reception first. 

Imagine our surprise when the hotel decided to charge the credit cards we used to pay for parking an additional £13.95 after departure without saying a thing or contacting us. 

Despite calling several times and emailing hotel to dispute they ignore us so 1*.... Good customer service gets good reviews!

By the way your contact email address on website is incorrect according to your reception team!","3","","2017-03-31","2017-03-31","2017-03-31","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r471587698-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The lady who checked us is was polite and very helpful. 
We did not have breakfast as there was little chance we'd get up in time but if the photos are anything to go by, it does look really good so shame I was so lazy/hungover :)
The room itself was pretty cool, lots of storage, comfortable, good TV despite lacking channels. The bathroom and shower are epic - the sort of shower that hurts it's that powerful, ohhh yeeeaaahhhh! :)
I unfortunately had to rate this establishment 4/5 because the parking cost is shocking - £16.00 per night and I'm a Yorkshire lass so naturally I almost swallowed my wallet so I didn't have to pay it.. I suppose you'll pay it because it's convenient but I cannot say I was happy to pay that - even Birmingham NEC don't charge that much. 
However, I will certainly return if in the area and if I'm at a gig. Maybe swallow my pride instead of my wallet and just pay the parking without my inner monologue shouting at me to be reasonable. :)

Service: 4","Great weekend hotel!","Stayed here for a weekend in Bristol.  It was a cracking location virtually on top of Temple Meads station and as a result is perfect for both rail connections & air connections as the airport bus stops there.

Room was well sized & inviting with all the usual amenities you'd expect to find bright and comfortable, plenty of space for two adults I'd say and more than ample for one!  Only slight complaint would be that the air con is hit or miss with no discernible difference between 1 & 3 - in context it was like a vacuum cleaner in the next room so while not LOUD it would still be enough to disturb light sleepers!

The bathroom was small but functional, very bright & well stocked with toiletries for those perhaps forgetting something.

The staff were top notch respecting the guests & not being overbearing, informative of offers (breakfast upgrade) but without seeming robotic or forced!

If you're looking for a place to stay 5 minutes away from connections in & out of Bristol you're laughing, at only 10 minutes walk away from the City Centre it's spot on.  The local area is convenient with numerous shops & places to eat located around as well should the need arise.","0","","2017-02-28","2017-02-21","2017-02-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r461813761-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Digital check in was a really good idea as I could choose the room I wanted before I arrived rather than having one allocated to me.  Even though I checked in digitally, the actual check in experience was quite slow as for some reason they had not taken payment so this had to be done at that time.  The room was quite small and the bathroom tiny. The bed was also quite hard although I did sleep reasonably well. I was woken up at about 5am with deliveries arriving at the hotel. I had a park view so I dread to think what the noise would be like on the road view.  The room did have everything you needed such as an iron and ironing board, empty fridge and tea and coffee facilities.  I stayed on a bed and breakfast rate and I have to say that the breakfast was a bit disappointing. Cold porridge and only butter for toast. When my partner asked for sunflower spread instead we were told that they only had butter. It was all, well, a bit basic.  For the price I paid I didn't think it was that good value for money, particularly the breakfast and room size, although the location near to the train station was a plus.","0","","2017-02-28","2017-02-20","2017-02-20","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r461625986-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We checked in online, and that let us pick a room, which was amazing. Our welcome was incredibly friendly. The room was amazing, with innovations to make our stay more comfortable (the pivoting mirror is genius). We used the gym, which was very decent for the hotel size - dumbbells up to 20kg, a cable machine, and a few cardio machines. A pleasant check out and the hotel is perfectly situated between the station and the town centre. We paid £44 for a room for the night, and we would absolutely stay here again for the right price.

Breakfast was way above average.
Reception staff were happy to provide details of best routes to places we need to be, and even arranged a taxi for us on one of the mornings.
5 Minutes walk from Temple Meads station, and about 5-10 minutes walk from town centre.

Nice park directly outside. Spotless rooms. Friendly night porter. Relaxing bar

Absolutely faultless and for £70 peak season (Xmas) you couldn't ask for more. 

Only minor criticism is the wait to be checked in was about 15 minutes as the night porter was the only one behind the desk. The receptionist and finance assistant were doing things behind the counter but avoiding eye contact with us in the queue so they didn't have to check us in.

I woke up with my colleague and walk to the door and see what happens. I FORGOT to take ""do not disturb"" out the door (but it's that necessary to do that?) then I took it out and unbelievable thing happened. A second loud knocked my door again??!! I dialled to reception to ask what's happening to your housekeeping. NOBODY!! SAY BLOODY SORRY!! To me just said ""oh ok!! I talk to them !!!???? What is that?? After that still keep closed (bang) another  room's door next to our room often and bloody loud!! 11:50am I checked out and talk to Reception Manager. You know what? Even to be sincere to apologise  to guest who paid £120 that night I haven't got it for them just easy sorry.😠 so if you wanna pay for expensive and high quality you expected just go somewhere else NOT HERE!!

The only thing with the room was it was a little dark with all the lights on and no light over the mirror. The car park is very small and didn't see a car park near the hotel. Do not sure where we would have parked. The car park is also not included in the price it's an additional £16 for 24 hours.

It was my first time in Bristol. I figured that, if I paid the extra asked by this hotel, I would have a better than average night, as the cost was more than double the usual hotels I stay in for business. 
1. I was told when I booked on the booking line that parking would be £12.00. When I arrived, I was told it was £16.00.
2. The bathroom was very cheaply fitted out. Plasticky fittings which were coming away from the wall in places and no power shower. The shower was a flimsy affair that hung off the wall and had to be screwed into position in order to be able at the right angle for me to stand underneath it. Then the water just trickled out of it and it took me approximately 45 minutes to wash the soap off me. 
3. The bed was solid as a rock. No comfort and no sleep. 
4. The room was small and the coffee making facilities were barely adequate.
5. At breakfast (I arrived at 8am, so was not even remotely late) the croissant basket was empty. I asked if there were any more, as I was having a continental breakfast and already had the cold meat and cheese. The woman in charge told me in abrupt manner that there weren't any more and I could have a pain au chocolate instead. I told her that it would not mix to have a sweet pastry with ham and cheese. She just shrugged dismissively. She exhibited no customer skills at all. I feel that, in a city the size of Bristol, they could have an arrangement with their baker and have the ability to fetch more croissants if they run out so early.

Anyway, the upshot of it was, I complained about these issues on their email address. The very next day I was sent an email of apology and an assurance that they would pay back the full price of my accommodation. They even stated the amount they were going to pay and that it would be at my address in 5 to 7 days. I sent an email accepting this offer. 
A few days later I received another email asking me to send them a copy of my statement showing how much I had paid. I answered, telling them I could not get to a scanner for a while in order to comply with this request. Now they are telling me that unless I do this, there will be no refund. Needless to say, I am appalled by this double cross.

This wasn't made apparent to us when we booked, and when we asked if we could change rooms to one with a bathtub, we were told there weren't any bathtub in all the rooms and refused. This is the first time I have ever asked to change room in my life.

The hotel is quite nice, modern and clean.  Parking can be a pain at times but I got a space every day last week. A short walk out the back of the hotel takes you straight to city centre. The hotel has a small but functional gym which I also liked.  

My only complaint was the quality and price of evening meals.  Not a massive menu, which is ok, but the price for portion size seems unfair.  Anything with vegetables seemed to get the smallest portion of vegetables I ever seen. Additionally I over heard restaurant manager telling a potential xmas booking she didn't know how to book xmas dinners, and bluntly told the person on the phone we have turkey, when obviously asked what was in the menu.  Some restaurant portion control or revised pricing, and a customer relations course for evening staff and this would be a lovely hotel.  I would still stay again but probably eat out.

I can safely say, I will stay again. 
I arrived to friendly staff on reception, who greeted me with a smile and waisted no time getting me checked in. 
The room was clean and nicely decorated, with tea and coffee making facilities. 

I didn't try dinner at the hotel, but the breakfast was amazing. Plenty of choice and just what you need to start your day. 

The room was always cleaned to a high standard and the cleaning staff always greeted me with friendly chatter when I passed in the corridor. 

Checkout was quick and simple and took a lot less time than I thought. Which meant I could get an earlier train than planned. 

I may be needing to come back to Bristol in the future and I know where I will be staying :)

Common in most cities but at £16 for up to 24hrs - it's ridicules!!!

There are alternatives, you can park down the road in a public car park and only pay until 6pm or park on the road around the corner. But if you want some security for your car - pay the £16. 
I paid only because I wasn't comfortable leaving my car exposed on the streets, but that's where they have you. 

The hotel might have the Hilton name but it's no Hilton hotel, more like a holiday inn express. Small rooms, very comfortable and good standard, extra small bathroom with shower only. 

The reception staff are friendly but shy away from comments about the parking charge. 

Room service has a £5 try charge, the prices are high as you expect from a Hilton. 

If you book with the hotel directly, you are supposed to get free wifi-which you do, but so does anyone in the hotel-do they think we're stupid. No benignity to book through Hilton Honours!!!

The bathroom was small as other reviews have stated but was more than adequate for the two of us. Our room was the city view as opposed to the park but we had no problems with noise and didn't hear a thing despite building sites being close by. We were able to get a space in the car park where we left the car for the weekend as most places are within walking distance or a short cab ride away. We will definitely stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in the future and look forward to going back.","0","","2016-11-30","2016-11-08","2016-11-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r435583473-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 4","Nice and Central - Everything You Need","Our foursome of two couples used this as an overnight stop en route from London to Cornwall travelling by train.  We booked standard Queen Bed, Parkview rooms and found these nicely appointed and very functional, both for our quick overnight stay and for longer stays.  The hotel is 5 minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads rail station (using the short cut route, 10 minutes otherwise) which was a prime reason for selecting it but also was a short walk to the ""floating harbour"" and other sights in Bristol.  We would definitely book this hotel again when we next visit Bristol.  

Particulars are as follows:

Location:  As noted, this hotel is well located for those travelling by train as we were doing.  It was not hard to find and is mid-sized.  It has a nice view of a park (Temple Gardens, I think) which houses the ruins of a former Knights Templar church, Temple Church.  The park is nice and quiet and enjoyable to walk through and see the substantial remaining ruins.  We found a large range of restaurants and fast food places nearby as well as ATMs.

General:  The hotel is quite modern and in good condition with a reasonably spacious breakfast/dining area and bar and a compact but serviceable front desk arrangement.  (Although the late afternoon sun hits desk staff in their eyes and hotel management could well consider adding some tinting to the windows on the park side of reception.)

Room and Amenities:  The room was not spacious but also not cramped.  In particular, it was well designed and kitted out, being sufficiently large to accommodate a couple of large suitcases.  It had a comfortable bed, a desk, two chairs and adequate storage.  The bathroom was fine, with shower only but it was a good shower.

Cleanliness:  No complaints on this front.

Breakfast:  Was included in our room rate and was much more extensive than we expected for a chain, particularly for the good price we paid for the rooms.  There was both cold and hot buffet options along with some opportunity to order freshly cooked eggs of select varieties.

Staff:  Staff were cheerful and helpful.  Our traveling companions had a problem with plumbing and were immediately moved with staff help to a nearby and better class of room.

Would we stay here again:  Absolutely with no hesitation.","0","","2016-10-31","2016-10-29","2016-10-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r432680626-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Did not want to pay £4 charge for delivery of sandwich . The menu does anything from chips to sandwiches to steak . The sandwich was nice snd you get coleslaw and a few Crisps for £7. 

We did not do breakfast but I had a quick look and it was quite nice.

The car park we used it from fri at 830pm on arrival to Sunday it was £16 in total for us this was OK as we never moved the car all weekend to keep out spot ( if you move it you could lose it) if the hotel us really busy best to keep your spot , they did say if we lost it we'd only is for the day we used it and when you check out at 12 you can keep your place all day . Ideally it should be free parking but many hotels charge now. 

The hotel location is perfect right near the city , we booked an amazing Itallian meal at a close restaurant 10 min walk away it was the best and the town is safe I felt comfortable walking about. 

Make sure when booking you chose this Hylton as there is another close to it but it does not look as impressive do choose Hilton garden city centre . The bar closes when the last guest leaves so another good thing . 

Would I stay again most definitely and I'm fussy so this was a great choice for us .

The room was spacious & quite well appointed, the bed comfortable. There was a real shower rather than standing in a bath. I feel that hotels are generally terrible at breakfast, once they have your money from the room rate it becomes a cost reduction exercise. A this hotel however, they seem to make an effort, the buffet was fresh & constantly attended, eggs were cooked to order and there was also a waffle station for a hot alternative to the standard full English.","0","","2016-10-31","2016-10-16","2016-10-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r428365587-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Can't fault the hotel (except maybe bar prices, but you expect to pay more).  Very clean, nicely decorated rooms.  Everything you need and more.  One of the most comfortable beds I've slept in.  I'm usually a bad sleeper but had the best nights sleep in ages.  Food was really nice, especially the breakfast.

Very quick check-in and helpful friendly staff.

We booked through GB Tours and for the price we paid we didn't expect to get such a nice hotel.  Didn't get to see any of Bristol though as it was only a stopover.

Sleep Quality: 4","A good hotel near Bristol Temple Meads train station","This Hilton hotel is part of the Hilton 'Garden Inn'  brand and is perhaps a little more basic than a standard Hilton.  It is located in the business district of Bristol. It is a short 10 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads train station (the main train station to London) and the hotel does have a small car park.  

For this visit I checked-in online (so I could select my own room) and my key was ready for me.  All the rooms on all the floors are of the same standard, and my room was absolutely spotlessly clean.  It had the usual facilities, but a little smaller than you might expect. The bathroom just had a shower and was particularly compact.

I had a quick meal at the bar - an omelette which was ok and came with either chips or salad.  Again it all feel a little basic, in most hotels omelettes would come with both.  The Merlot was perfectly drinkable.

The room was reasonably quiet, the bed comfortable and I got a decent nights sleep.

Breakfast was a hot and cold buffet with bespoke eggs if you wanted.  The food I had was good as was the coffee.

Check-out was quick and efficient.  The staff were all friendly.

Overall a good stay.","0","","2016-10-31","2016-10-13","2016-10-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r427650046-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel car park I did find a little expensive at £16 a day, if you're a guest of the hotel paying over £120 a night this should be complimentary or charged at a much lower rate. Reception staff friendly and efficient. Rooms are small but comfortable, great for business travellers as spacious desk space and comfortable chair to work from. Beds comfortable but pillows a little to soft for me, woke up with a stiff neck. Showers powerful, again bathrooms very small but has everything you need. Iron and ironing boards in the room which for business travellers particularly is very useful. Big TV in room with plenty tea and coffee making facilities. Didn't use bar or restaurant so can't comment on these. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty, busy with lots of people running around but that's unavoidable. Internet was fantastic, you could even stream Netflix it was so good. 

My only real negative (apart from soft pillows and expensive parking) is the house keeping staff are very noisy so I'd be apprehensive to stay here for leisure if I was hoping for a lie-in. As I was on business I had to be up early anyway but this would really annoy me if I was hoping to sleep in.

The parking lot is not large enough to handle all the cars, so people park anywhere which make it difficult to get your car out of a proper parking space. I couldn't believe the size of the room. This goes back to the London hotel room sizes of the 1970. As usually, Hilton seem to have a problem with hiring people who's first language is English.  Also. to get two face cloths in a Hilton brand hotel in England is a challenge.  Their breakfast is a buffet, but you can order the eggs the way you like.  I ordered an omelet and it took them 20 minutes to make it.

Frankly I found the staff rude and preoccupied with things other than their guests. When I went to leave the hotel that evening nobody answered the intercom to let us out of the hotel meaning I had to go back to reception queue up and then be rudely dealt with again. The receptionist didn't even look at me or speak to me when I asked for her help, she simply passed me a car park token. 

The Bristol half marathon was being run the next day and on returning to the very small car park there were no car parking spaces. We parked on the street later to have my car towed away. I don't blame the hotel for that but if you have got a small car park acknowledge it and if there are local things going on then provide information to help aide your guests.

The hotels in Bath were so expensive, this seemed like a reasonable alternative, since there was a regular schedule of trains to both  the Bath/Stonehenge areas and this was much cheaper.  I was not as impressed with this Hilton property as I thought I'd be, though it was clean and convenient. It was about 100 yards walk from the train station (exit out towards the wharf, cross the parking lot, take a diagonal through the plaza and it's across the street---there was a lot of construction when we were there, so there might be an easier route...). This property was kind of sparsely decorated--that Scandinavian look--but it was comfortable and friendly. 
Check in seemed a bit busy --but it turned out one of the clerks was on a break---which we found out when we went to our room and found the A/C was not working. Tried to call the front desk (no dialing instructions in the room--had to guess what to dial) and no one answered for 5 minutes. Finally gave up and went back downstairs to inquire---desk clerk said she couldn't check because she'd have to look in the back room and the other person was on break...leaving me standing in the lobby waiting to find out if I had to change rooms....eventually she was able to check and found out the A/C had been turned off in the room (!) and enabled it for our use.
She mightn't have bothered--we ran that unit at full speed/as cold as it gets for 2 days and it never dropped below 80 in there. I know we Americans generally are used to A/C and cooler rooms--but this was really uncomfortable.
The room was clean; the beds comfy; the bath  really nice and I loved the fridge in the room. Just wish it could have been more a more comfortable temperature for sleeping. 
Breakfast was not included, but if we chose the option at sign in, we could get access to the buffet for less than 10BP per day---after looking around near the hotel and finding very very few options, we chose to go with the buffet. Probably worth it since we could eat a big breakfast and skip lunch during the day.
All in all, not a bad hotel. Friendly staff, felt safe to walk around at night, and there are several pubs and cafes nearby (but we were there on banking holiday weekend and several things were closed for the holiday). Short walk to trains.","0","","2016-08-31","2016-09-25","2016-09-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r422110441-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Arriving 17:30 we were allocated rooms and despite the fact we were all in same party we were split up over the whole hotel, we were on the first floor as well as my brother and his wife.
My brother has a walking aid and when we arrived at the first floor it was Impossible for him to reach their room, why? At 6 pm the corridor was blocked with numerous trollies as rooms were still in the process of being made up!  At 6 pm in the evening!!! 
The hotel room was fine as expected for this type of Hotel,
As we were with a tour we had a set meal to start at 6:30pm, however, the meal left much to be desired. The ""school dinner line up"" was inefficient to say the least. My wife and I are well travelled not only in UK but worldwide.
To serve a pate with dry white or brown bread (NOT TOAST) was a first, the bread had obviously been open or hours as it as dry as a bone. The main course left many of our tour participants speechless, the large pork chops were so dry and cold they were curling up. The so called mix of vegetables in one serving dish were steamed and thrown together in a watery mess, these were cold as well, my wife and 2 other from our 6 person party had pasta again barely warm and this was at 6:30 pm at the start of the dining period. There was a fish dish; however, no one was taking this as they did not have a clue what it was!! No indication at all until I asked the staff.  The gravy was totally ruined, if a chef in an Hilton restaurant can't make gravy without massive big lumps of ""BISTO"" gravy mix then they should be in another job. The desserts were laughable cheap supermarket cheesecakes!! These had also been left out for hours as they disintegrated when you tried to put a piece on the plate all the other items were cheap supermarket cakes.

We realise there is a budget for this type of trip, however, if I can go to our local pub and have a 3 meat carvery with 5 types of vegetables etc, etc for £4.50 it puts a Holiday Inn restaurant to shame.

There were only 2 coffee sachets and 1 tea bag in the room with 2 small milks so have a cup on arrival but not in the morning seems to be the policy in this hotel.

The female ""manager of the bar area was very helpful and nice and friendly, again bar staff require training how to serve a pint, not so full with no head that it spills as soon as you pick it up!!
I have contacted the tour company as well as many others on the trip and they are aware of the number of dissatisfied travellers as they have already had numerous complaints.

The breakfast was the normal hotel type and was very nice.","1","","2016-09-30","2016-09-06","2016-09-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r415275972-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

As we had gone  as a coach party, dinner was provided. I have had better canteen dinners that what was served there. I understand that as a city hotel it caters more for business people, but if they cannot provide an adequate dinner service then they should not say they will do it.

Washroom was tidy.
Be aware ! Parking around this area is very tricky, with restrictions in place, ALSO the hotel offers a very expensive over night parking of £ 16, so ideal if you are at your own.
These days some constructions work is going around this area, so at times you need to travel a bit longer than planned sat nav route.

All I wanted from the evening was rooms service, tv and sleep.
The tv was not working and despite several calls to reception no one gave me an explanation as to why not an apology. I ordered a pizza which was served in a pizza box with salad on top - was thin and tasteless and sent back. I was asked to chose something else but declined. Eventually, at 10pm, I walked down to reception to ask about the tv, they told me there was only service in half the hotel so they moved me. Shame they couldn't have done that on my first call.
The tv worked fine and I was offered a nightcap as way of apology, which I accepted!
Aside from these issues the hotel is in a great location & breakfast was good.
Parking is paid for in the hotel, but they must give you a ticket to get out, which was forgotten when I left and I had to 're-park and return to reception! 
There is a Doubletree and Hampton nearby so in future I will opt for these first.","0","","2016-05-31","2016-08-16","2016-08-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r406246620-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The interior is very pleasant, the rooms have user-adjustable air conditioning (very helpful in all seasons especially Summer!). The food quality was superb & the Breakfast Buffet is especially good value for paying just a small extra amount. I managed to get my room swapped after e-mailing the Hotel in advance so that I could stay next to other people I knew, which was very much appreciated. Unfortunately, I can't give my stay 5-stars as my departure was met with challenges - you pay for the parking in advance but there is no notification/obvious notification that Reception needs to issue you with a Barcode Receipt that needs scanning to open the exit barrier; this I only discovered when I tried to leave and, when pressing the Help button on the exit barrier was connected to a telephone line that was asking me to press buttons on my phone to reach different teams; this needs revising as it's not providing a service. There was a lady behind me in the queue who had a receipt & directed me back to Reception to get one, but she appeared to of been issued one which had expired (they're typically valid for 30 minutes) - so when I walked out with my valid ticket I gave mine to her and I walked back into Reception to then collect another exit ticket for myself. This part of the Hotel estate has been poorly setup and needs urgent revising; if it was Winter and/or Raining then this would lead to people's visit being completely tainted. Recommendation: Guests NEED to know the procedure & the Help Point at the exit gate needs to actually provide Help, not just connect you to an automated line that asks you to press buttons where this quite clearly can't be done","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/5c/5c/2b/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

It is great they speak many languages, as she was Hungarian and so is my partner. So they spoke in Hungarian which is fine. But she never once greeted me in Hungarian or English. She also did not give me any information and I had no clue when breakfast was or for how long.

However the rest of the staff were sublime. The morning staff and breakfast staff were so helpful and friendly and the breakfast was fantastic.

I had stayed there many times some years ago now.

Check in took far too long, with only one receptionist available. She was busy dealing with a man complaining about the lack of WiFi in his room, the iron burning his shirt and numerous other things, leaving the queue to grow longer by the minute. This was particularly annoying as I was in a hurry to get to an event. 

Other than that relatively minor issue, I have no complaints: the room was fine, I enjoyed a decent breakfast and found the staff to be pleasant and professional during my stay. 

I'd use this hotel again if it wasn't quite so expensive.

Upon check in a lovely lady named Charley told me that the car park was full but that they were recommending parking across the road in a public car park which was free until 8am. This for us was the best choice anyway as we were getting up early. The hotel car park is £16 which I wouldn't want to pay anyway given the option. Room was clean and basic. My one issue would be the shower. After a long day I just wanted a hot shower but couldn't for the life of me figure out the temperature gauge. It had no arrow to tell you which way was up and to me was just to frustrating. When left to my boyfriend he figured it out with a bit of patience as it was taking a very long time for the water temperature to change. All in all would stay again ","0","","2016-07-31","2016-07-17","2016-07-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r393580452-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

There was a stand up shower rather than one over a bath which I liked but may be a bit annoying if someone was over for leisure and wanted a bath. Its great that there was parking right outside the hotel but worth knowing there's a car park behind the hotel that's free after 6pm as the parking in the hotel is really expensive and got full quickly. Also at the moment I couldn't get to the hotel off the main road (the way the sat nav took me) so had to go round the back - no fault of the hotels of course but worth knowing for the moment!","0","","2016-07-31","2016-07-14","2016-07-14","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r392759101-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I've stayed at this hotel numerous times for work and each time, it just continues to frustrate me and have notified our travel team to seriously consider removing them from our preferred supplier list. 

1.) Car Park - Stop letting non hotel guests park in the carpark. And prohibit parking on the white lines - why have restrictive lines if you don't care who parks there?? .... That's right; you just want £16/24 daily fee
It is a bloody nightmare getting in and out of spaces - a car was scraped but driver drove off as the hit car shouldn't have parked where it did but Mario (hotel manager) doesn't care one iota.  Most business guests like myself have larger, expensive cars. 

2.) hotel rooms - blooming basic and nothing special and NOT worth the daily rate.  Tiny, quite worn looking and you You can't swing a cat in the bathroom and the toilet is awful. 

3.) LED TVs, they have been installed for over 8 months now and the signal and reception is still dire and missing the bulk of FREEVIEW channels 

4.) WIFI - a snail can move faster than that speed. 

5.) Charges your credit card as well as invoicing the Company account

6.) the food wasn't overly great in the past but has improved a great deal but the price of the breakfast on top of the room is extortion considering what is on offer

7.) Trees in the carpark will leave your car with a horrid sticky substance all over it - BE WARNED 

Until the above issues are address, I will no longer stay here and will continue to use the Novotel next door for the office or will go further into the city and stay at Radisson Blu, Marriott or DoubleTree. 

This hotel in my view is only suitable for business guests and that's at a push.

Find yourself a cheerful hotel in the old Temple Meadows (shortened to Meads) off Victoria Street leading from Brunel's Great Western Railway to the Bridgestow bridge (the old bridge giving Bristol it's name) and hard on the brutal inner city ring road.  Buy it and put it into the Hilton brand and in the process loose a little of the independent spirit of the City Inn brand that provided brilliant business class experience for Holiday Inn prices.  The walled garden across road from front of hotel is an oasis of calm in England's 8th largest city.  Give a good welcome - charge £16 for parking overnight !! and a breakfast to suite all tastes.  Good consistent quality - ideal for overnights but suspect a little longer would prove too bland and experience.","0","","2016-06-30","2016-07-04","2016-07-04","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r389269896-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It was clean and had a comfortable and spacious bed, along with some excellent storage and seating in the room. The bathroom was also a very good standard. I was unsure of a couple of things, firstly, the pricing of the car park (£16). The company website through which you can make your booking isn't very clear as to the rate being overall or daily, to the extent I thought this was an overall rate. The front desk also suggested the same but a bill was posted to the room stating £16. I complained and it was refunded which was admirable but I'd like to see the website updated to be more clear as it effects people's pricing of their night's stay. Otherwise, breakfast was quite nice for myself but the salmon option wasn't well received by my girlfriend. For example, it was supposed to come with brioche and it came with brown bread instead. I did enjoy my full English.

We chose the hotel as it is a Hilton Garden Inn and we are Diamond HHonors members.  The location was great - we could walk from the hotel to the train and be in Bath in less than 20 minutes.  

As for the hotel itself, our room was very clean and the bed exceptionally comfortable (a given from my experienced with HGI).  The room was, however, a bit on the small side.  Comparable to a Hilton Garden Inn I have stayed at in New York City, where you are accustomed to small hotel rooms.

We had room service the first night at the hotel.  The food was ridiculously good for room service.  We visited the bar that night as well - the service was excellent.

We ventured out of the hotel the second evening; the location was perfect for seeking out many great restaurant options.  

The staff at the hotel was was superb.  We needed to do laundry and, as the sundry shop was out of detergent to sell, they kindly brought us detergent, for no charge. 

The Bristol Hilton Garden Inn is highly recommended.","0","","2016-05-31","2016-06-18","2016-06-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r383782370-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The bathroom looked tired and run down. There was no room to swing a cat!
The hotel gave the usual tea coffee gratuities, no water, no biscuits.  There were not the usual dressing gowns and slippers I usually receive in HH.
Breakfast was repetitive but eatable.  I did order dinner via room service, the phone is not compatible with hearing aids and I could not hear anything the person was saying. They came to my room to take my order. When the food arrived it was 'ok'. I'm not a fussy eater by any means.

Check in was absolutely fine. I was expected and my room was ready. She asked how I was. Helped me find a sandwich. 

The room is small and not as nice as it looks on the website but certainly fine. It's currently (June 2016) surrounded by scaffolding which noisy or really a problem but kind of just feels like it's surrounded by scaffolding. 

The shower is fine. 

The bed isn't huge but it's ok, the mattress isn’t amazing and I didn't sleep well but that was probably only 23% the mattresses fault. Breakfast was fine! Lot's to choose from. The very friendly breakfast lady made me poached eggs and showed me how she got them like that. 

The cereal comes out of one of those cereal crunching machines that you know I hate. 

The iMacs are gone and this is now a soulless city hotel, where thankfully the staff are excellent and that nearly makes up for it.","2","","2016-05-31","2016-06-16","2016-06-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r383103048-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It was a shame there was no bath, as I much prefer them to showers, and the double bed seemed quite small. It was quite firm as well- which I didn't mind, but my husband didn't like.

The breakfast was the main event, lots of lovely food and plenty of it. Try the waffles, they are lovely. The location is good as just a short bus ride from Cabot circus (unless you're feeling energetic!) and close to the station, didn't hear the traffic but did get woken up by some roadworks on the Friday.

It's nice enough, not amazing but then we weren't here to lounge about the hotel so it was fine.","0","","2016-05-31","2016-05-30","2016-05-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r377928389-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The staff were incredibly helpful and polite throughout the stay and definitely did all they could to make the stay enjoyable.

We checked in using the Hilton honours app which was incredibly simple and enabled us to choose a room and meant check in was incredibly simple. The room had everything you needed, however the bathroom was quite cramped, and a few areas were incredibly dusty. The wifi was patchy and slow so difficult to rely on. Dinner was amazing and the portions were huge and breakfast was good. The only downside was I had almost finished my breakfast before I received my gluten free toast!

The room was fairly small but very comfortable with everything you could want in it. The breakfast was good but there was a limited selection. The only issues were: 
1. The car park is very small and getting into spaces is difficult. There are roadworks taking place outside the hotel and the road leading to the car park is blocked at one end and so I went round the block a couple of times trying to work out how to get in.
2. The breakfast area is quite small and when I went down at 8.00 there were no tables and those that became free were not cleared quickly.
3. After breakfast, as I was getting changed a member of staff burst into my room without knocking or checking there was anybody in there. Not a nice thing to happen.
4. The air conditioning kept switching itself off after an hour or so and the room was stifling when I woke up.","0","","2016-05-31","2016-05-20","2016-05-20","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r374945666-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is very well placed - only a few minutes walk from Temple Meads station.
I loved that with The Hilton, you can check in online and choose your room!

The lady at the front desk was super friendly on check in.  We were on the top floor with a park view.
The room was smallish but clean and modern.  There were the standard facilities - plus some convenient extras such as Iron & board in the room, and an empty fridge for you to keep your own food in if you want.  Good shower pressure too.

We hadn't paid for breakfast but changed our minds in the morning - there is a cafe attached to the hotel.  The breakfast was top notch! Excellent eggs and bacon.  The staff in there were super friendly too - trying to convince us to eat more!

Feedback from the rest of our party who were also staying at the same place was equally positive. 

Highly recommend for a short break in Bristol!","0","","2016-04-30","2016-05-05","2016-05-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r370454596-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The welcome at reception was great and although we had to wait for our rooms this was fine. We had reserved 5 rooms in total including the 4 I had booked myself. We had been advised that there would be no water at the hotel for the first few hours after arrival, although this notice was only 2 days before arrival. We were not able to have a shower before going out in the evening or flush toilets ect and we were not compensated for this in anyway. Unfortunately due to the short notice and needing 5 rooms we were unable to book elsewhere to stay which appeared to be the suggestion of the hotel.
This saying the hotel was clean, modern and well equiped and the shortness of water did affect us but did not ruin our stay. What did ruin my stay was the lack of sleep. We were in a 1st floor room above reception and the noise through out the night of groups of men swearing, shouting, arguing, talking excessively very loudly, taxi's pulling up, beeping horns, doors slamming inside and outside the hotel and below my bedroom was completly unacceptable. I phoned down to reception in the middle of the night to complain about the noise and they explained that they had already spoken with the gentlemen and understood what i meant, so they would approach them again. However, the noise continued and i spoke with reception in the morning who acknowledged my complaint in a professional manner. The breakfast choice and quality of food was excellent and so were the staff members in the restaurant.
I have no complaints with the hotel other than the noise and the lack of water and would have given 5/5 if it wasnt for these aspects.","2","","2016-04-30","2016-05-02","2016-05-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r369501309-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Pros:  The hotel is easy to get to by car though parking might be a little tight.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The rooms are clean, reasonably spacious, have ironing boards and irons, and fridges (all essentials for long business journeys).  Big TV with reasonable sound!  The showers are powerful enough and the heads are not fixed to the wall (I hate weedy showers and fixed heads).  The air conditioning is good enough to keep a room reasonably cool.  The bar has a few interesting beers and spirits in, alongside the usual blandness.  Dinner was acceptable but nothing to write home about, breakfast was very good (if you like full English) with reasonable variety, the coffee is acceptable.  The town centre is only around 5 minutes walk away, with a variety of places to eat and drink.   On the negative side, not very much to report:  The beds are oddly lumpy but that hasn't stopped me sleeping deeply on those rare occasions when I do.  The wifi coverage is hit or miss (mostly miss when you are in your room) and performance was patchy.  Not enough free power sockets in a room and not well positioned (at the desk I had to unplug the kettle and the lamp so I could plug in my laptop and stuff - not onerous but a pain when you then need light or a cuppa as well!).","0","","2016-04-30","2016-04-19","2016-04-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r365553197-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I must say the front staff and the breakfast crew are lovely very friendly cheerful and always happy to help in particular the lovely lady who does the eggs.

Room was clean good size
Perfect location everything is very local 

I have one small complaint in regards to room service 

The first night the food was ok however the second night I rand for about 15mins before someone picked the phone ordered same salad as first night I was very disappointed with the presentation, portion few ingredients were missing and the chips was cold.

I paid almost £13 for a bowl of salad and this is what I got 

It's not letting me add the pics 

I would defiantly not recommend the room service food you can literally walk 5mins down the road and you will have a wide rang of options and several restaurants

We arrived at the hotel to find the worlds smallest car park. There are not many spaces though you can park opposite the spaces on white lines, however it is very tight.

My OH chose the room via the Hhonors app before checking in. Check in was quick and easy, and the receptionist was helpful and efficient. The room in all was small but had a modern toilet room and shower, we were also very pleasantly surprised to find a heated mirror. The room had a hairdryer, desk and mirror, wardrobe, tea making facilities and a fantastic HUGE TV opposite the bed. More light around the mirror area would be appreciated as at one point I ended up aiming the reading lamps over towards me.

Our bed however did not match the rest of the room. Whenever my OH rolled over in the middle of the night I felt as though I was experiencing a theme park ride with bouncing and loud noises, at one point I thought I'd broken the bed from sitting down to fast. Both of us woke up with sore backs and necks, we may have just been unlucky with the mattress we had.

In all it was a decent hotel for the money, we paid for breakfast in the hotel which had quite a large selection buffet. If it wasn't for the back breaking bed and the tight fit carpark I would have definitely rated it higher.","2","","2016-03-31","2016-03-27","2016-03-27","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r359064386-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It's wonderfully maintained. Perfectly clean and fresh. Newly refurbished and (most) of the staff are a credit. The rooms are lovely but TINY just about manageable for a single person but in no way a queen room with barely enough space for one person to move around and no way to open the wardrobe without some serious furniture rearranging but again as a single traveller that was manageable and the rest of the hotel was great

Breakfast was very nice and the resteraunt was fresh and airy

Sadly the deal breaker for me and the reason I had to cut my visit short and move hotels was the beds.. I was sleeping alone so I can only imagine the problem would be exacerbated if you tried (God knows how) to fit on two people! Although the pillows were comfy enough it was the single most uncomfortable bed I have ever come across. So hard and lumpy I barely slept for 3 days and when I did wake i was in so much pain in my back and throughout my body (and im only 31 years old with no history of back pain) I was forced to run to boots for heavy painkillers and take these by the bucketload each day. I did comment on this to the staff and they did tell me all the rooms are the same and my room was actually an upgrade.. 

It really is a shame because it is a FABULOUS hotel and with such lovely staff but if you can't sleep its not viable for me at least. If you are a lone traveller and comfortable with very very very hard beds and no need to no move during the night you might be ok with it but until the beds are remedied I won't be able to return.

Bathroom had good quality fittings, a powerful shower and a good selection of premium cosmetics.  The room had good soundproof windows as we couldn't hear anything from outside.  Large flatscreen TV wall mounted in front of bed.  We didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that.  Reception staff were friendly.  They also had a 'pantry' area with drinks, alcohol and snacks available for purchase 24hours and I believe there was  a room service option.  We read about the parking costs beforehand so were not surprised and I believe £12 for 24 hours is quite responsible for Bristol city centre.","0","","2016-01-31","2016-03-22","2016-03-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r357627954-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The heating in the room didn't seem to be up to much and the Internet, whilst free (a really great thing) kept cooking out.

The next day when we asked about Clifton and how to get there, she could not have been more helpful..
The room was on the 4th floor, very quiet up there, large bed, lovely shower, plenty of bathroom amenities , good size T.V , tea and coffee making facility. All in all a very nice room. 
The breakfast buffet was excellent, plenty of choice and food to order, all very hot.
Local transport for the area is outside the door or very near while they are doing road works.....","0","","2016-02-29","2016-02-17","2016-02-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r348562034-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

This is very much a loud party hotel, women were screaming from 2am in the morning until 6am, behaviour you would expect in a cheap hotel not of a Hilton standard:
The beds were uncomfortable and hard, the heating didn't work nor did the safe or refrigerator and I had two rooms and they were both as bad as each other.

There were a few members of staff who were helpful but other than that their was nothing else to write home about!","1","","2016-02-29","2016-02-17","2016-02-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r348485443-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The location is fab and the room was large, comfy and a treat to stay in. I'd give constructive feedback by noting the following

1. The conditioner provided in the room had been used and was nearly empty (not an issue as I had brought my own however)
2. I was in a room close to the lift and the sound of the lift arriving was a bit annoying, although it stopped before it got so late that it would disturb my sleep
3. Although there is free internet, the signal in my room was so poor it didn't work properly.

Onto the good points though, the reception team were wonderfully friendly and helpful with all my questions and the location was fab and the bed comfy, which is really enough from a hotel to sleep in and nothing else. I might have expected more had I been travelling for pleasure and not business but that is splitting hairs.","0","","2016-02-29","2016-02-16","2016-02-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r348277945-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I chose this hotel for convenience to the office, the evening restaurant and a conference venue I was going to the next morning. When I arrived I remembered this was actually the hotel I stayed at before eight or nine years ago when it was branded a Park Inn. I remembered it then as a very comfortable hotel.

This time I was disappointed. The check in was ok but took ages and had the other more experienced receptionist not intervened would have taken even longer. The room wasn't huge but that wasn't a problem for a night's stay and it had everything I wanted other than a slightly bizarre half locked but empty fridge. It had a comfortable desk chair too. My main complaint about the room was that the wifi was appalling - kept dropping out and the speed was excruciatingly slow when it did work. This would have been a significant problem had I been staying for longer and wanted to work in the room. Also the room was very stuffy - the traffic noise meant I couldn't sleep with the window open and the air con refused to drop the temperature much below 21C. This led to a poor night's sleep.

Breakfast was ok but nothing special. The staff were very friendly though.

Overall I won't be returning. I am sure there must be more comfortable business hotels when I next stop in the city.","0","","2016-02-29","2016-02-13","2016-02-12","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r347289066-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The bar was well stocked and the breakfast was great. It's nice to find a hotel who offer more than plastic cheese and wafer ham as the continental choice

I'm glad I didn't arrive by car as a couple of colleagues struggled to park

The good:
The Staff: really helpful, friendly and professional.
The location: 12 minute walk from Bristol city center 
Breakfast is all you can eat buffet
Park view rooms are quiet

The bad:
I supposedly had a Queen evolution room, but it is in my opinion just a fancy name for ""very normal double room"".
The bed was squeaking like a pissed off squirrel. 
The choices of channels on TV were extremely limited.
The bathroom supplies (shampoo, etc) were below average
The room, and by extention the hotel, didn't have any classy feeling to it, and resembled what you get at a 3 star chain, for twice the price (and it was on offer).
Breakfast: Eating as much as you want often comes at a price: you need to forget about quality. And that breakfast wasn't a exception to the rule.

The ugly:
A painfully slow internet connection
£12 a day parking that you cannot book. It's first come first served. It was full both days.
Empty minibar. You have to go out of the room and buy your drinks near reception

 Conlcusion:
Was it horrible? No. Again, staff were really good - without them this review would have been a 2 star one. But it wasn't a unforgettable experience either. I've stayed in cheaper 3 star hotels that had more class.","2","","2016-02-29","2016-02-09","2016-02-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r346303197-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We managed to get a parking space but i can imagine that can be a bit of a fight at times as its limited.
Its off a very busy road in but you couldn't hear a peep when inside. We came in at peak time so it was a pain to get to - meaning we could see the hotel for 15minutes before we could actually park up - try get there out of peak hours.

It doesn't have the biggest of dining and bar area but the staff were very attentive. The breakfast in the morning is very very good - excellent selection as well as international selection. A chef is on hand to make you something to your liking which is always good.

The room was modern, clean and comfy. The bathroom was on the small side but the shower made up for that - its always a danger in hotels that the shower just dribbles on you but this was not the case - full force to wake you up with a steady temp.
The tv reception was off as they has just had maintenance so not the best but i was out on the cocktails so shrugged that off - im sure they would of helped if i persisted on that matter.","0","","2016-01-31","2016-01-30","2016-01-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r343727956-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We were due to stay in York but at the last minute had to cancel due to the floods so quickly found an alternative city to visit. We chose Bristol as there is so much to do and Bath is only a short train ride away. We booked two rooms via booking.com, for 28 and 29 December, we decided to book the best rooms available as it was a post-Christmas treat so booked the queens rooms with park view. The park is small but could make out the cardboard boxes/homeless tent. There is a car park on site for £12 a day so were able to leave the car safely for the duration of our stay. The train station was only a few minutes walk away with regular trains to and from Bath.

I had to provide my credit card details to confirm even though we were paying by cash - fair enough. On arrival we confirmed we would be paying separately, one couple by debit card and ourselves by cash. We were told they needed to pre-authorise my credit card but payment would be due when we checked out, again no problem.

We decided to put the cases in the rooms, quick freshen up and meet in the bar to decide a plan of action. The menu looked appetising but when we paid for the first drink it was so expensive we figured we would be better dining out at one of the many lovely restaurants in Bristol.

Unfortunately I was unwell so didn't do as much as we would have liked but still We had a lovely stay, the shopping choice is great and found a couple of lovely places to dine. The choice down by the river is huge.

Bath cathedral is lovely and we had an enjoyable stroll around.

Sleep was bad but being unwell didn't help so maybe on another stay I would have found the room more comfortable. Breakfast was great with a varied choice.
 
We checked out and paid for the rooms plus parking charge by debit card/cash as per our booking. We visited Bath that day leaving our car on the car park and went via train and really enjoyed the walk round the town, and our visit to the baths which really is a fab museum and well worth a visit. We ended our visit by dining at at Grillstock smokehouse in a converted railway vault. We were served quickly and really enjoyed the burgers/pulled pork. Not the best restaurant I have ever visited but it was quirky and the food was good.

We returned to the hotel, got in the car and returned home thinking all in all we had had a good visit. Then I noticed my credit card had also been charged by the hotel for one of the rooms. I called and was told they would look into it and get back to me. When nobody returned my call father a couple of days I sent an email with all the details and explaining I had paid by cash yet my card had also been chargedI received one back the following day saying they would look into it and get back to me. Finally I sent another email to the manager expressing my disgust at the customer service and asked them to get the police in to check the cctv so they could see us paying by cash. I then received an email from the manager 9 January, saying the police weren't necessary, they could see that I had paid cash and it was an error that the charge hadn't been cancelled from my credit card and that is a pre-authorisation amount. I was told the transaction would be cancelled and that it is normal for it to take 10 working days to be removed and that the manager will be in touch to let me know when it will appear in my account. Tonight (12 January) I called my bank to check it is a pre-authorisation transaction and they said it is a debit transaction that I will be charged interest on. I then emailed manager again. 13 January email received from the manager saying their finance officer is now looking into it. 28 January - No further contact received and no refund and have now been charged interest by credit card company on the transaction so now reported to credit company, maybe they will have better luck than me getting money back

Have to say it soured the visit and if I return to Bristol it will not be to the Hilton.","1","","2015-12-31","2016-01-29","2016-01-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r343513912-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Check-in was slow and I saw queues at the front desk quite often. Efficient processing but understaffing problem. Should have fast-track mechanisms for online pre-check-in and for HHonors elite members but no such mechanisms evident. At least the free internet meant I could work while I waited to check in.

Room is a good size. TV is good although I would have liked more channels. Bathroom is a bit cramped and has a weird shower door that makes getting in an out a bit difficult. I stubbed my toes a couple of times in the room - layout could be better and/or slippers provided but didn't see slippers. Breakfast is good - typical selection of food for a UK hotel. They do a nice gratis espresso at breakfast if you ask for it.

Hotel is close to the main train station about 5' walk. Location was convenient for me given where I was visiting. I would stay here again.","0","","2016-01-31","2016-01-28","2016-01-27","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r343235228-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

My last stay however was rather disappointing as the hotel now appears to have a lot of relatively new and inexperienced staff.
Never got or was offered the complimentary water, as expected as a silver member.
Shower in room was cold until it had ran for over five minutes, good luck with that if you're in a hurry.
Finally there was little or no power in the shower.
Good to hear that the chap checking me out was sorry about that.
Think I will be looking elsewhere if I have the option..sorry about that.

Reception was quick and easy, staff did not seem to know however how to go to the city centre (Arnolfini building), was told I could not walk there (too far) while I discovered I was 7 minutes from it. Another staff fortunately stepped in and gave me directions, which was good. Hotel location is therefore great, not far from the old part of the city but very quiet. Room was hyper clean, compact and I really appreciate the big flat screen tv and amenities in bathroom. I had asked for a high flirt and was given a 1st floor room. Thought street level noise would be annoying but was surprised by the quietness of the room, probably because of the double glazing. Door's lock was a bit too hard, closing doors would each time make a bit of noise which was slightly unpleasant. Hotel provided free newspapers and the highlight of the stay was the breakfast buffet, fresh, lots of variety: pastries, fruits, English breakfast ingredients, the whole lot, yum and at 13.95 pounds it was a great deal, particularity on cold winter mornings! 
I advise people to take the back door an walk thru the park, you'll be amazed by the beautiful Pisa-tower like church.","0","","2016-01-31","2016-01-24","2016-01-24","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r342277204-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I only had coffee for breakfast, but those around me seemed to be eating well. The coffee was the proper stuff too...none of your button pressing espresso machine ersatz coffee here.

This one s OK, it's a building that has been through a couple of hotel guises in recent years. The rooms are quite small, but furnishing level is practical and OK. Shower took ages to get warm, just a minor thing. Other wise room fine.
Breakfast was good for a buffet style.
WiFI worked OK in the room and was free.
Only downside was parking charge, why oh why does a hotel need to charge £12 a night for the use of its own car park ??","1","","2015-12-31","2015-12-27","2015-12-27","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r335212781-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Why?  Well the location is great; handy for the station, great for walking into town, the rooms are comfortable and clean (although I am not a fan of the shower in room 230 which has a mind of its own), the food always looks and tastes fantastic but more importantly because of the staff!  I have never met a more friendly team in a hotel, even at 0615 hrs when I checked out this morning I was greeted with a smile and a pleasant conversation at both reception and in breakfast.......it is not what is expected but it is very much appreciated!  Thank you for making my 2 or 3 night stays in Bristol so simple and I look forward to seeing you all again on the 4th of January!

I drove from Blackpool, took about 3 and a half hours, easily reached the hotel because of the convenient city centre location. Medium sized onsite car park just front of the hotel another convenient. £12 charge acceptable. 
On my arrival welcomed by friendly reception staff. I booked a room under the points and money reward scheme, cost me 12,000 points and £32.85. I requested for upgrades as per my diamond status, but unfortunately receptionist told all rooms are same, but as per my wish allocated a room at the top floor. 
My room number 520 with a view of the small park called Temple Gardens, just behind the hotel. As usual Hilton standard room is spotlessly clean. This hotel acquired by Hilton from Mint hotels with another 7 hotels in 2011 and after full refurbishment opened on April 2012. Still the room and the furnitures are kept in fine condition even after three years. Bathroom is average sized with a shower. All amenities provided. 
When Hilton took over these hotels from Mint, rooms installed with Apple iMac, instead of TV. (Hilton GN Birmingham, HGN Glasgow still got iMacs). Actually iMac screen is so small and it's not a replacement for a TV in a bedroom. I mentioned this to Hilton when I stayed those hotels, and they replied me near future they are considering to replace with TV sets. Here iMacs replaced with wall mounted TV sets. Thanks. 
I had my dinner and breakfast at the hotels restaurant City cafe. Breakfast is fine, but dinner also ok but the staff so exhausted and attending to arrange next day's breakfast even at 8.30pm! I wrote a separate review about this. 
Checkout done smoothly. Overall my stay at this hotel is fine. No complaints and nothing special also! Just a clean budget hotel stay!!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/d2/90/48/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg","2015-11-30","2015-12-21","2015-12-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r334296613-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Staff were pleasant at breakfast and especially cheery when we ate in the hotel restaurant.

My room itself was pleasant, though perhaps just slightly too small for the furniture inside it (one large chair didn't seem to have any real place there) but this of course was not something that mattered. I enjoyed a decent night's sleep.

Very reasonably priced which included breakfast, which was self service but very good. Plenty of choice and the waiting/restaurant staff were superb. Totally attentive without being in your face, and cheerily efficient. The rooms are not luxury, but for what they are, they are very good. It was spotlessly clean, and the room had nice little touches that some other more expensive hotels lack, or you have to ask for. You get a full size fridge, which if you like a glass of wine after a hard day's sightseeing, you can buy one in advance from the nearby Tesco and it is nice and chilled when you are ready for it. There was an ironing board/iron and a hairdryer. There are plenty of mirrors, and more importantly, plug points near the mirrors so that you can see when you are styling your hair. So many hotels don't do this, you have to move furniture and unplug lamps, but not here. A large flat screen TV was welcome. The bathroom was a shower room, a bit cramped when you got out of the shower, but the actual shower was roomy and worked well. Hated the easy chair in the room - it was too cumbersome for the size of the room. The only Eason I did not give this a five score was the hard bed. I stayed 2 nights and by the second night I got a bit more acclimatised to it, but the day after the first night saw me with a sore hip and lower back pain, which is not something I normally suffer with. I would return, it ticked a lot of boxes. A well run and reasonably priced hotel in a prime location, what's not to like?","1","","2015-12-31","2015-12-13","2015-12-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r332503284-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

A tip for the breakfast all the same. Get your egg before getting the bacon, blackpudding, bread and coffee beacuse the lady who cooked it, took so long cooking it that everything went cold.
Apart from that, lovrely hotel.

A very functional and absolutely soulless hotel but with decent facilities -  proper tea and coffee and glasses rather than plastic beakers.  The shower room even had flannels.  It is a hotel built for the car with views one side of the cars whizzing around the inner ring road, and on the other side of a massive car park - despite only being a short walk from Temple Meads station.  Room was fine, if you like views of dual carriageways and traffic lights.

The hotel is in a perfect location. It's a very short taxi ride from the train station and in close proximity to the shops; literally a few minutes walk. Plenty of restaurants and pubs within walking distance and a short taxi ride to livelier bars and clubs.
 The hotel itself hasn't been open long and everything is clean and fresh and well maintained with excellent facilities. We booked this hotel at a very reasonable price for a city center hotel on a Saturday night.
 The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and they made sure we had an enjoyable stay. 
Our room was brilliant. We had a room on the top floor which was modern and spacious and had everything we needed such as shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and moisturiser in the bathroom, iron and ironing board, kettle, air-conditioning and heating, comfy beds, black out curtains and free wifi. Breakfast was served up until 11am and was delicious.
An absolutely perfect stay. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitelybook again next time I'm in Bristol.","0","","2015-11-30","2015-11-17","2015-11-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r327317437-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Bad point out of the way, the hotel is in a great location, 2 minute walk from the train station and 10 minutes from the main nightlife and harbour-side area. Local convenience store back towards the train station (just before Weatherspoons). Head towards the harbour-side for a Tesco express, Subway etc.

A comfy bar area with sky sports was ideal for a few beers while catching up with the sport. A very good outside area for food or drinks, it was ideal for evening drinks before leaving the hotel for the harbour-side.

Friendly staff and good service, as expected from the Hilton chain.

Rooms were compact but as we were out (or in the bar) most of the time no real issue.

Breakfast was excellent, coffee and tea self service and hot food choice really good, nice pastries as well. Didn't use but there are vending machines for snacks 24 hours (hot and cold).

I would recommend the hotel for exploring Bristol and would stop again (hopefully though the rooms would not be so hot).","1","","2015-08-31","2015-11-16","2015-11-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r327232823-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Check Inn: When we arrived at 10.30am our room was not ready, so we parked up and came back at 2pm to check inn. The check in was smooth. 

Rooms: We had a queen room with a garden view; the room was well sized and very clean. They have great faculties such as tea/ coffee, shower, bath, hairdryer, iron and board. My only grumble would be that there was no hand wash in the bathroom for you to wash your hands, just soap. However, there was a selection of shampoo, conditioner and body wash, which was complimentary. 

Breakfast: The breakfast selection is excellent whether you want cold or something hot. There was an excellent selection of cooked, continental. You have to make your own tea and coffee. I thoroughly enjoyed the waffles on my final morning. 

Bar: There is a bar area at the hotel, unfortunately we tried to have a drink here but the cocktails were not made well at all and we had to complain about them. Therefore, we chose not to drink in the bar area again. 

Wi-Fi: The Wi-Fi was very poor!

Overall: A great stay. The hotel is very close to the city centre, just a short walk to the shops, restaurants and bars. I would definitely recommend the hotel and plan to stay again in the near future. We even stayed an extra night due to loving Bristol so much… 

Room Tip: We stayed in room 228.","3","","2015-10-31","2015-11-01","2015-11-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r323664677-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Arrived at 18.15pm on the Friday night and was pleasantly surprised to find parking spaces. Check-in was handled efficiently and we were given a 5th floor room. Rooms are small, particularly the bathroom(shower only), but they are finished to a very high standard. Only a 10 min walk to the main shopping area's and loads of bars and restaurants within easy reach. Highly recommended.","0","","2015-10-31","2015-10-12","2015-10-12","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r317985652-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The sandwiches where tasty but fairly standard.  The scones freshly baked with plenty of cream and jam.  It was my wife's birthday and this was celebrated with a modern twist on a birthday cake.  Towards the end our grand daughter wanted some more of the delicious strawberries and the staff went the extra mile creating a stunning sweet especially for her.

Recent trip room was uncomfortably hot, air con noisy and not very effective and switched off after a short time so so kept waking up far too hot.  Couldn't open the  window as although I'd asked for a quiet room I was given one facing the busy road.  Noisy creaky bed was rock hard.  I like a firm mattress but this was ridiculous.  Previous Apple media replaced with a large wall mounted TV which can't be angled to view from desk/chair.  Dreadful Muzak playing outside rear door so no point in trying to go outside from the noisy bar to make a phone call.  I used to enjoy staying here, but there are other similar priced hotels nearby which offer bigger rooms and a decent night's sleep.","1","","2015-09-30","2015-10-01","2015-10-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r315482509-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Our other friends came by train and this is an excellent location for this because its only five mins from the train station) the rooms are not massive but perfectly adequate. Good in room facilities. Fairly comfortable bed. Bathroom a little small. The only drawback I could find is that the room got quite hot and the window only opened about an inch. The staff were all friendly and helpful especially the Hungarian barman who was a star, especially when faced with eight people all wanting many rounds of cocktails (yum) all in all a good and happy stay.","0","","2015-09-30","2015-09-28","2015-09-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r314422037-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

You guys really do put the Double Tree second. Superb customer service, great food with some novel presentation too. Comfortable and well appointed rooms that still have a biscuit with the tea and coffee in the room, lovely little touch. Loving the huge screen TV, that's much better! A better selection of fine wines to compliment a well thought out menu which does represent really good value. A beautifully prepared and presented buffet breakfast still offering something for everyone. What's not to like?

Nothing that I can think of other than some may find the rooms a little on the small side and I don't really need two chairs -which would create more floor space.

I do like the fact that you can put clothes and personal items in to drawers and cupboard space you can close, I'm not a fan of this open plan nonsense that you find in Premier and Travelodge. And this Hilton Garden has the cleanest bathrooms and best design of user friendly shower of any hotel I have ever used!

So, my hotel of choice, still, and I have tried them all. Well done guys!

The location is a good spot for shopping and just about walking distance to the older city of Bristol, but could be deceiving if you haven't visited before and you could end up having to get a taxi...

Upon arriving our room wasn't ready so we headed out for an afternoon in Bristol, on foot, and found ourselves in the middle of a business district rather than Bristol city centre, we were about 10minute stroll from where we needed to be.

Arriving back our room was ready and we have a great view over the garden, worth requesting as the other side faces a busy dual carriageway.

The room was clean, the bed is tiny, I'm 6ft and my feet hung over the end. The TV didn't have freeview working efficiently but this was something that didn't bother us. There isn't bottled water in the rooms so be prepared to tap it, or head down and buy some in reception. 

The bathroom was clean and well maintained. 

We had a late lunch/ snack at our room and that was great, same with the drinks very reasonable pricing on beers and wine.

Good Points 

Clean 
Tidy
Friendly Staff
Good Pricing on Beverages 

Bad Points 

At £149 for a double room then paying £25 for breakfast, and a further £12 to park I thought it was very expensive for what it is, the rooms are smaller as is the bed and much less comfortable of those such as Premier Inn etc 

It was disappointingly basic for the price, and I'd stay in a Premier Inn over this hotel again if I had the choice, or for £200 I'd chose a different hotel

Parking is limited. They advise you to park in the municipal car park next door. Great! But beware they don't emphasis the fact that if you're not out there at 8am to put a new ticket on you will get a fine. We saw about 6 cars on Sunday morning all with tickets. More care please.

Not a great place at weekends as this is stag and hen hotel central. Lots of loud, drunk people in the bar and next morning at breakfast. I wouldn't mind but once you've seen one inflatable pen!s you've seen them all.

Seemed like acool idea to put Mac computers in all the rooms (doubles as TV) but the Mac remote is not very reliable and was a constant frustration.

Buffet breakfast was really good and would have been enjoyable had it not been for the large swathes of still drunk hens/stags constantly going in and out for ""quick fags""","0","","2015-09-30","2015-09-16","2015-09-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r310990559-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Well up to the standards expected from the lower rate Hiltons, (Doubletree/Garden Inns) Close to the station at Temple Meads, ( a bit of a hike for the elderly with baggage, special needs, and a bit too close for the cost of a taxi), and not too far from the City Centre. A bus stop outside the hotel is very useful, especially for getting up to Clifton, (and back). Facilities basic but everything you need. There were two restaurants we wanted to try in Bristol so we didn't eat there at the hotel. Staff as always at the Hilton, friendly, helpful, and efficient. If I was to return to Bristol, I'd definitely stay at the Garden Inn.

One small thing. Just down the road is the Hilton Doubletree. Very close to the Garden Inn. 10PM on our second night someone was trying to enter the room. We looked through the spyhole in the door, and saw someone looking very confused. When I opened the door it transpired that he had the same room number at the Doubletree and had mistaken the entrance to the hotel. It was laughed off and with good humour. Perhaps clearer signage for the hotels and some kind of warning at entrances? Just an idea.","0","","2015-08-31","2015-09-15","2015-09-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r310506989-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Overall, I enjoyed my stay but there were one or two things that seemed out of place for a pretty expensive hotel.  The breakfasts on offer are actually better during the week than at the weekend.  During the week, an additional menu of five or so items is available of about five items, which can be freshly prepared for you, these items include kippers and omelettes but the menu is not available at the weekend.  Although, I have to say that the buffet itself is pretty extensive and will suit most tastes, it just seems an odd omission.  Also the cleaning of the rooms is pretty erratic.  On Sunday afternoon, I returned to my room and 5.30 pm and the cleaners had just used bleach in my room and were finishing up the cleaning.  I will add that the cleaning and housekeeping was always well done but there did not seem to be any consistence concerning the time that the cleaning was completed.  Normally, with most hotels, there seems to be a cut off point at about 2pm or 3pm, so that I guess the guests can go back to their room and have a shower before dinner.  The Reception staff were nice.

I found my stay in the hotel okay but not exceptional.  For some reason, I expected more.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/ee/56/14/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg","2015-09-30","2015-09-15","2015-09-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r310414212-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Our room was very much in the old City Inn style, including Apple Mac, with a few updates. We enjoyed the view from the room which overlooked the small park at the rear of the hotel and thought it possibly quieter than rooms at the front. Room was very clean with all the little touches we expected i.e. good toiletries and proper glasses.

The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is because the room was stuffy, the window doesn't open very wide and the air con was quite noisy (for me) and the hair dryer is poor quality.....either burns your scalp or is cold, a decent hair dryer doesn't cost much. 
We're looking forward to next years trip to Manchester and will definitely go Hilton!!","1","","2015-08-31","2015-08-27","2015-08-27","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r304167999-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I woke up at 1am and the room for far too hot even with the air con set to manual and the coldest setting.  It made the nights sleep very broken and uncomfortable.  Sleepily fumbling around to find the window at 2am and my mate waking to see me in my pants near his bed, was not the ideal situation to be in.  The blood drained from his face, a deadly silence fell on the room and for a brief moment, our friendship died.

anyway, overall it was good.","3","","2015-08-31","2015-08-25","2015-08-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r303137636-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

","I booked this hotel through my booking agent and paid a very reasonable £95 for B and B.

Arrived late at night and was checked in swiftly by 2 very polite and helpful front desk team members.

Room was good quality, bed comfortable, everything worked in the room and was very clean and tidy. Aircon if you leave it on can be noisy so had to get up through the night and turn it off but not a big issue really.

Breakfast was very relaxing and the food was very good. Plenty of choice and it was a help yourself style of service.

All in all a great stay however just one thing took the edge of my stay, a £12 parking charge that I wasn't expecting.

My invoice came through the door and when I looked at it I was surprised to see the charge.

My booking agent didn't mention it and nor was it mentioned when I checked in.

I suppose most hotels charge something for parking now and either hide it in the room rate or charge separately but £12? Really that much for an overnight stay when I have paid for my room and food and drink in the bar?

I think if I had been told I would have been prepared and even a small charge of £3 to £5 would have been more palatable.

This may be the normal charge around Bristol city centre but I hope the team at HGI Bristol City Centre review their charging structure.","1","","2015-08-31","2015-08-25","2015-08-24","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r303113610-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was clean and comfortable with an ;-)'s, ours had a view over the park, very nice.

Breakfast was very very good but does finish at 10am. We also ate in the bar last night which was lovely as well.

The staff are fabulous and friendly.

We stayed here on purpose as we were visiting to do the Shaun the Sheep trails, this was a massive hit but a bit exhausting. 

We will definitely be back because we didn't get chance to do the normal touristy things we would have done.

The room itself was small but comfortable however I could not sleep very well due to a continuous noise from behind the wall. I was told at the reception that if this was not air conditioning (which it wasn't) they could not do anything, which was quite disappointing given the level of service one would expect from Hilton...
Also, there were no biscuits provided in the rooms (I know, everyone is going healthy these days but I love my hotel biscuits!) and the hot chocolate was only replaced 2 days after I drank it. Only 1 herbal teabag was provided. On the third morning, I discovered that the shampoo provided, which was half-used and which I was planning to use that morning, had been removed and not replaced! Luckily I had my own to use but this was an unpleasant surprise.

The breakfast was OK but I found the choice rather limited, particularly with my egg intolerance...

On the other hand, the location is fantastic, 5min walk from Temple Meads station and the city centre, and no noise from the street bothered me at any point even though my windows faced that way. 

All in all, an average stay for a high price - will choose a different hotel next time.","0","","2015-08-31","2015-08-16","2015-08-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r299925035-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

My shower was cold on the first morning, even though I ran it for a quite while it was freezing and only just slightly warmer on the second day but better in the evenings.
Nice quiet hotel at night even though my room was on the car park and main road side.

Used as a base for a trip to Bath as I booked late and all the reasonably priced Bath places were booked out. 

Key points;
- Close to Bristol Temple Meads station (walking distance)
- 10 mins or so walk into central Bristol
- Immediate area is drab, a busy road, office buildings with not many shops
- Perfectly functional rooms but nothing special
- The fish at the restaurant was actually far better than I expected

Nothing wrong with the hotel and it was more or less what I expected for the price.

I arrived late on Sunday night and the staff were lovely. The room was clean and spacious and had everything you needed, the bedding was changed regularly and it was cleaned every day. The breakfast was very nice with lots of choice and the evening meals again had plenty to choose from and were delicious. All the staff in the bar cafe could not do enough for you.

My only real criticism would be the noise on the restaurant at breakfast. There is music playing that you can't really hear but it is loud enough to sound like a constant hum. And the chairs make a racket when people move them.  Both of these could be easily sorted.

The room sizes are generally good, on this occasion mine (216) overlooked Temple Church and gardens park. As it's at the back of the hotel I didn't hear any road noise at all. 

The room was pleasant, bright and clean so all good. At the Garden Inn they have Apple iMac TV/PC's in the rooms which are good. They can take a bit of getting used to if you've never used one before but decent enough.  WIFI is also complimentary throughout the hotel. The rest of the room amenities are as you'd expect and a good standard. The bathroom was a little ""compact"" but clean enough so again no complaints.

I used the fitness center which was fairly small but all the equipment looked in good order and was fine. 

The City Café Restaurant food was good. I had the Black pudding, pancetta & pea puree to start followed by the Chicken Supreme. I was impressed by the quality of the food and the staff in all honesty. Everything was cooked really well and the price very reasonable. 

Breakfast was the traditional buffet style but again the food was well cooked and well presented. As I sat and ate my breakfast the chef came out and changed the food a couple of times, for me that's always a good sign as very often food is left out and dries up or gets covered in water from the dome lids they use.

Overnight parking is a hefty £12.00, in most hotels these days this is free for residents although I guess that's what you get in a City center with limited space.

Overall a good stay and I would go back.","0","","2015-07-31","2015-07-16","2015-07-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r289512389-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I have stayed in many Hilton hotels so was expecting this short trip to pleasant and comfortable. 

Check in:
Check in was ok, but the lady on reception was a little abrupt when I refused to leave my card details for extras. I never do this and always pay as I go. Never had any issues with this in other hotels. But she most definitely seemed a bit annoyed when I politely declined. 

Room:
I was in room 216 which was very small for a double but nicely decorated, modern and clean. The TV is apple and took a fair amount of tinkering with to simply put the TV on. I have an iPhone and iPad and I still struggled to figure out what to do for a while! 
 
Restaurant:
The service was extremely slow and I was the only person in there for the first 30 mins. The waiter didn't know what the soup was and had to run off to ask. I was sat waiting for my drink and menu for a while. I ordered a mushroom and leek tart to start which was very nice but it all went downhill from there... The main was awful. I ordered the sirloin steak (£6.95 supplement) which was served with chips, tomato, mushroom and watercress with a peppercorn sauce. I asked for my steak medium-well and it arrived rare. Blood was spilling onto the plate when I cut into it and it was a really fatty grisly piece of steak. The chips were most definitely frozen and still a bit hard in the middle, then the peppercorn sauce was really watery and lacked flavour. It all mixed in with the blood on the plate which looked awful. For desert I had my eye on the apple tart-tatin served with ice cream. I placed the order and again waited a while. Another waiter came over and asked me if I wanted to order so I told him that i had placed order but it hadn't arrived yet. When it did arrive it was not at all what I was expecting! It was a slice of cold apple tart served with berry coulis and what seemed like squirty cream from a can! So I ate some of it but by this point I'd had enough. 2 minutes later the other waiter arrived with an apple tart-tatin with the ice cream that I had asked for!!! The waiters seem very confused and don't seem to understand the menu or what customers ask for. 
Breakfast was not much better, I was greeted by a waitress who lead me to a table and disappeared never to return. She didn't explain to me that everything was self service (including tea and coffee) or offer to get me tea or coffee, so I sat for a while waiting to order drinks then noticed the hot water and coffee station beside the door. The food at breakfast was ok, nothing special. The staff at this hotel could do with some customer service training so that they deliver the kind of service expected at a Hilton hotel. 
I would not stay here again. ","0","","2015-07-31","2015-07-14","2015-07-14","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r288875335-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The aircon was a waste of time - was set on a timer so kept switching off throughout the night and the room was very hot. The aircon was noisy and to be honest not that cold anyway. The bed was extremely hard but the pillows were perfect. Overall for the price we paid it didn't exceed any expectations, I have stayed in many Premier inns and have to say I prefer them, the quality and standard is just as good if not better and the price can be very good if you get a saver rate. If had the choice in future I would definitely opt for a different chain rather than the Hilton. You are basically just paying for the name in my opinion. There was also a query with regards to my bill, I booked via booking.com and on arrival the receptionist asked for my card to verify, after checking my pending transactions I noticed that they had added an extra £26 to cover any ""extra"" costs and when I asked why they said it will be refunded but could take a few days, in meantime this did affect my available balance, bit of a bummer if on a budget weekend and needed that little bit of cash.","0","","2015-07-31","2015-07-14","2015-07-14","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r288836584-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

When we arrived the car park was almost full but we managed to find a space. The receptionist gave us a warm welcome and allocated a room on the 5th floor overlooking the small park at rear of hotel. As we headed off to the lift I commented to my husband how she had excellent customer service skills. I appreciate the balance of helpful, friendly and efficient. 

Yes the room was small but very clean and well equipped with everything we needed including an iron and ironing board. When out and about in the city we just want somewhere clean and comfortable to come back to. 

The bar, restaurant and outside area were fine and again the waiting staff were lovely especially the lady with red hair who suggested 'a nice chilled glass of Prosecco' to revive me after my day out! 

We enjoyed breakfast, it's self service even for tea and coffee, no problem and all the usual choices plus there is a waffle machine and a chatty lady cooking the eggs to order.

It was £12 to park the car and we think that is acceptable for a city centre. The sun shone and Bristol was buzzing with several events on including the Shaun the Sheep trail. Overall very happy with this hotel, a big tick for customer service and yes we will return.","0","","2015-07-31","2015-07-13","2015-07-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r288520602-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We chose this hotel mainly because of the price, both booked in the Hilton sale.
As Hilton honor members we checked in online the day before and picked the rooms we wanted and check in time (we went with 3pm as this was the earliest).
On both occasions the room was not ready which is disappointing when you have selected the room and check in time the day before. 
On the first stay they phoned up and got the cleaners to get the room ready while we waited. On the second stay they ended up changing our room when they couldnt get a hold of anyone. This was a shame but did not ruin out stay.
The rooms are quite small but have everything you need.
There is also an empty fridge in the room which is useful. The shower was also very nice and powerful. 
Breakfast was great, lots to choose from and everything was very nice.

It would also have been convenient for the shopping area and main bus routes if we had wanted them.

We received a very friendly welcome at reception, the room was fine (and soundproofed, so quiet at night) though the bathroom was very small, and the buffet breakfast was one of the better ones we have had in hotels, and well-organised.  The very Bristolian lady doing the fried eggs was quite a character and rather different from the usual bland staff one finds in chain hotels.  

This is a modern building with a high standard of decor - we had no problems at all and it was a relaxing start to our holiday.","1","","2015-06-30","2015-06-29","2015-06-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r283809194-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

 We were facing the road and had no trouble with traffic noise. 
We went down stairs to the restaurant for evening meal as we had both been working that day and travelling there we just wanted a quiet relaxing evening. Good service with a good choice of food.
We then went into the bar area and had a drink good service again. 
The team at this hotel are very good,. 
We had a good nights sleep in the comfy room. Good breakfast with the same friendly staff from the night before. Plus from the chef lovely lady.  Nice choice. 

Bad area very cramped to get to the self service buffet. 

Good position of Hotel  only 10 mins walk to the shopping centre or train station. 
After being out all day shopping and sightseeing, thought have a lovely shower before going out to eat., My personal flannel  different colour to their white towels had been taken from the shower cubicle they couldn't have thought we had left as other items was left there. Plus the bath mat which was theirs. But why !!!!  i had informed reception and they phoned housekeeping they put two white ones  there then for next morning reception staff said take one home. I didn't. 
That was only something small but i do expect my own property to be safe in the bathroom.  With the tight fit in the breakfast area this is why i classing a 4 star not a 5.

We had a large selection of teas and could choose coffee if we wished, a selection of cakes on a cake stand which included small slices of cheesecake, millionaire shortbread, berry tart, scones with cream and jam plus a selection of finger sandwiches such as ham and tomato,cheese and pickle and salmon. We liked it so much we stayed after for a fair old while just reading the papers and chatting which we enjoyed. There is a lot of food so you might not finish it all but the waitress kindly let us bring a cake or two home in a paper bag which she brought over for us. The view also I nice because there is a charming small park just outside (Temple Park I think it might be called) which I had never seen before visiting this café. I can strongly recommend a visit here - even when I visited the ladies, a member of staff who was visiting it at the same time smiled and said 'hello'.There were a few customers apart from us so it was not crowded or too busy. We went to a very exclusive hotel in London recently for tea and it was a lot more expensive for a lot less.

It's small but comfortable. Clean, but lacks attention to detail. 

A twin room is really cramped and there is no room for a second suitcase. We spent the 2 nights stepping over my suitcase on the floor.

We didn't get two towels and unfortunately didn't discover this until too late to ask for another one. Unfortunately the same happened the next day despite leaving a note for house keeping.

Our room also wasn't cleaned till way after 4pm. They also didn't leave any normal coffee. I did get some brought up on request very promptly though. I suspect this is just a housekeeping issue. 

Anyway. If you walk out the door on the left  (facing reception) you can take a stroll through Temple gardens to Victoria st, and from there the old city is a 10 min walk, which is really convenient. 

The breakfast is great and the staff there are really friendly, quick and helpful, ","2","","2015-06-30","2015-06-21","2015-06-20","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r281731336-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

In my view it is not really a residential hotel more a stopover similar to a Premier Inn though the restaurant food is a step up but the buffet breakfast is just that and pretty basic.
We booked a Queen Parkview for 4nts but were surprised by the cramped size of the rooms. So enquired whether there were larger. Apparently there all the same however if you have an easy access room there is considerably more space. But and its a big But the beds in easy access are only standard double. The Management were apparently genuinely unaware of this but persistence paid off and they actually went and checked and found I was correct. 
I am pleased that they very graciously conceded this and assure me arrangements are underway to make all beds Queen-size.
If you are aware of these points and can get a reasonable price comparable to other similar types of Hotel its well situated run by very pleasant staff and spotlessly clean.
Thank you all for what turned out to be a pleasant if a little cramped stay.","0","","2015-06-30","2015-06-19","2015-06-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r281386694-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Hotel is clean and modern. Welcome was friendly, although bit of a slow check-in, so had to wait a while as queues had built up (I find this part of hotels a real pain when you're tired after a long journey - some hotels need to put more resources into the check in process - this one did OK). I agree with one of the previous reviewers about the toiletries made in China - that is poor, when the hotel should be supporting hopefully local manufacturers, as well as the 'non-green' cost of transportation too. Apple imac TV is intended to be impressive I guess, but sometimes simple is better - i.e. a normal TV with a decent sized screen? Free and very good WiFi is great to see, with no annoying sign-in pages. 

I would use this hotel again, as positives much outweigh the niggles.","0","","2015-06-30","2015-06-18","2015-06-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r281179235-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It's very cozy and welcoming, with friendly staff. 
Instead of a TV, there's an Apple Mac in the room which is great because you have access to the Internet rather than just on your phone. If there's nothing you want to watch on TV, you can turn to YouTube, Netflix etc. 
The fridge was a bonus. 
The room was clean, light and airy. One small thing, only one chair is really needed - for the computer. As nice as the chairs are, they're a bit chunky and take up space. 
There's also a 'pantry' down in the lobby, full of necessities, food, drink for a reasonable price. I thought this was a good idea, especially if you're feeling lazy and don't want to walk to the shops. 
Overall, lovely hotel and we'll be returning again soon.","0","","2015-06-30","2015-06-18","2015-06-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r281117016-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Clean and room ok. However I awarded this hotel a very low review and this is purely for something that I feel very strongly about. The toiletries in the bathroom were made in China. It is very difficult to see this as it is very small print. Now China are very good at lots of things but not really that good at cosmectics or toiletries. Also it it not very environmently friendly to have it sent from so far away. So come on Hilton lets have something like Molton Brown or something similar for a Hotel that is charging £109 per night for room. I did use some of the shower wash. It was bright orange and of poor quality.

Sleep Quality: 4","Good, modern, well maintained city hotel","I've stayed here quite a few times now when working in the Bristol area and find this to be a nice, clean, bright and well maintained city hotel.
All of the staff I have come into contact with (front desk, restaurant, bar and room service) are polite, friendly, helpful and efficient.
Whilst some of the drinks are a bit pricey, they are no worse than other hotels in the area.  The food is always good quality, including that offered for room service and for breakfast, for which there is plenty of choice.  A nice touch at breakfast, which is the usual self-service offered by most city hotels now, is having a chef on duty at the food counter who will cook a fresh omelette or eggs to your liking.
The fairly recent introduction of self-service tea and coffee at breakfast would benefit from having some pots available to put the drinks in, rather than having to return to the table where the urns and tea bags are each time you want a re-fill.
As mentioned by other reviewers, there is only limited on-site car parking available, which can be an inconvenience at times since the nearby car parks are not the easiest to use in light of having to continually renew 'pay and display' tickets.
I've never had any real problems with the free Wi-Fi, other than it dropping out sometimes, but that has only been on quite rare occasions.
Whilst the rooms are not particularly large, and the bathrooms are quite compact, they are clean, well-kept and certainly have all the facilities you are likely to need.
I, like others, prefer the rooms at the back of the hotel which overlook the park, but these seem to fill up quite quickly, even by the time I arrive on a Monday.
This is a really nice place, very conveniently located for where I sometimes work and I have enjoyed all my stays here to date.
Would I stay here again?  Yes, definitely; I've already booked my next stay, and just hope that I can find a parking space and get a room overlooking the park when I next arrive.","0","","2015-06-30","2015-06-07","2015-06-07","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r278478053-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Wasn't best please after negotiating the smokers clustered in the doorway when the receptionist was rather more keen signing me up to some loyalty scheme rather than checking me in. A quick recce of the room and then down to the restaurant for a late evening supper. Turning up unexpected seemed to be more than the restaurant staff could cope with despite the fact that the restaurant was around only one-third full. Eventually managed to get seated and presented with a menu and then promptly ignored - after several minutes of fruitlessly trying to attract some-one's attention had to get up out my seat and go and interrupt a lady who was clearing tables so that I could order something to eat. Food when it arrived was very good (delivered hot and fresh to the table - a pity the quality of service didn't match the quality of the food) - waitress service for the rest of the meal was also very good and delivered with a smile which is always nice particularly at the end of a rough day. An early start the next day meant having to miss out on breakfast - tea and coffee facilities in the room were fine as was the comfort of the room itself. Would I stay here again - most likely yes as the location is okay and the comfort of the room also - I would hope though for more welcoming service in the restaurant.","0","","2015-06-30","2015-06-04","2015-06-04","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r277877616-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We checked in with a very pleasant young lady who was very charming and she wished my wife in advance for her birthday.
When we got back to our room that evening we were pleasantly surprised to find a couple of slices of cake in a plate with 'Happy Birthday' written across the top of the plate. A lovely touch.
The room was clean and well stocked with added benefit of a fridge in the room. We did enjoy our stay at the Hilton in Bristol and am sure we would use them again should we go to Bristol again.","0","","2015-05-31","2015-06-04","2015-06-04","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r277774877-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Obviously a recent revamp with new carpets, paint job and furniture, plus iMac in the room (with a small sound system) which did the trick - much better than a below average widescreen TV on the wall personalised with your name and muffled sound.

Nice super-king (instead of the single I'd been told) plus sensible lighting controls. Yes it did feel on the warm side so A/C was on all night. Free and instant wi-fi worked well (why don't all hotels have this as standard?)

OK food with above average service in the restaurant, but decor a little bland.

Front desk good and smiley, all good I guess. Would book again.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/06/b3/91/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

There is on site parking as well, for a £12 overnight fee.  This seems to be the average throughout the UK, so it is what it is.

The hotel has an internal (non fire escape) staircase that provides access to all the upper floors, in addition to the elevator.  For those who do not like waiting for the elevators, this is a welcome feature.  

The rooms are well equipped, but sized a bit on the small size.  The Apple computer which doubles as a TV is a nice touch, along w/ the built-ins that are rather functional so that makes up for it.

All in all, a good deal.  I would stay there again.","2","","2015-05-31","2015-05-28","2015-05-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r275360859-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The breakfast in the morning was perfectly cooked and the ""make your own"" waffle machine is a nice touch which I've not seen in other hotels before.

Although my room had an Apple Mac computer for TV and Internet, the free wifi in the room was temperamental and slow when it did work. As I don't like using my work systems on shared computers this caused me a little grief as I was not able to work as quickly as normal.

£12 for the night nights parking was consistent with the area and with the town centre a few minutes walk away I will definitely be back (though I will ask for a room with better wifi)","0","","2015-05-31","2015-05-27","2015-05-26","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r274936492-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Check-in was fairly quick and I received a good service from staff there. The room was a good size - it took me a moment to go round switching the lights on to see what the room was like. 

Good storage, fridge, safe and wifi connected easily. 
not entirely sure how I felt about the gimmicky iMac situation - I'd probably have preferred a bigger TV - but I can see the benefit to those who have not travelled with a computer. 
The bathroom was very average, though I Liked the folding door.

Unfortunately I didn't get on very well with the bed. The hard mattress was difficult to get comfy on and the duvet was too thin.

I checked out using express checkout and still am yet to receive the invoice for the nights stay. 

I doubt I will be booking a hilton experience again.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/f9/4c/ef/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

","We cannot rate our experience highly enough. We rang and made a reservation for Wednesday evening, when we arrived at the restaurant they could not find our reservation and it turned out our voucher was actually only valued on weekends anyway. The situation was handled smoothly and very efficiently and we were offered a table and redemption of our voucher.

The three course meal was absolutely wonderful and the service perfect. My partner had pate and I had a savoury tartlet to start, which were both full of fresh flavours, we both had chargrilled salmon as our main, which was amazing and for dessert we had tart tatin and chocolate fondant which were both lovely.

A great thank you to the two ladies who looked after us, for their attentive and friendly service and patience sorting out our voucher issue. We'll be back!

Rooms are small but lovely - great if you're out for most of day. Staff are efficient, friendly and helpful. Unfortunately things like amenity let this hotel down.
  3 Examples include:
* no umbrellas on rainy days - they could sell you one though! Which of course you would leave behind if you were flying in/out. 
*cheap nasty toilet roll that is better suited to a 1 star hotel.
*no pots for tea or real coffee in rooms or dining room or bar.
I know these are small things but these things impact.","0","","2015-05-31","2015-05-15","2015-05-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r272168819-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is a classic modern city type property. No grand entrances or lobby, however the staff on the desk were super efficient and most welcoming.

The room was very clean, you have a fridge which you can stock yourself - but I found the offerings from the vending machine downstairs expensive and the sandwich I bought was basic and stale.

Having stayed at a couple of Marriott establishment's  recently - where it appears the policy of the hotel chain is to provide beds which are best described as marshmallow-esque - fine if you like that sort of thing - I prefer a harder mattress. This was perfect, not rock hard - but firm and I slept like a baby.

If you walk through the garden style small park at the rear entrance of the building, in about 90 seconds you are on a road with shops, pubs and the route into the town centre.

The other access to the building is a duel carriageway with little to offer.

It's about a 15 minute walk into town - which was enjoyable on the warmest day of the year thus far.

Parking is additional twelve pounds - which the website did not state.

The Cafe bar attached to the lobby had a contemporary décor feel to it, but again the prices were a tad above what I would expect to have to pay for their offerings.

All in all a good one night stay","1","","2015-04-30","2015-04-30","2015-04-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r269064185-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Breakfast was well cooked and had plenty of choice although did vary slightly during my stay. It was still good even at it's worst. A colleague said the evening meal was excellent although I did not experience that myself.

The worst part of my stay was the Apple TV in my room. Not many channels unless you accessed the internet and then I found it didn't always want to work properly, mainly because the software was 4+ years out of date and the computer kept asking for updates it couldn't complete.

This hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the railway station and close to many businesses/offices.

The staff there (especially Anne, Jane and Laura) made our stay even more special. We were welcomed by Laura who handled our check in and check out flawlessly and even contacted me about something (a small lapel pin) which I had lost there. She later mailed it to me!  Anne, from housekeeping, kept us impeccably neat and clean throughout our stay and Jane, breakfast chef and Bristol native, made the best tasting and friendliest served eggs (""here y'are m'darlin"") we've ever had. The room was well designed but a bit spartan space-wise, although It helped to have at hand a nice big mac for our in-room tv and pc combined. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Obviously the business travellers had already discovered this gem, because while we were there vacationing for several days, during the two week days we spent there, business men and women packed the place solid.","0","","2015-03-31","2015-04-25","2015-04-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r267885900-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Also people had parked in areas that were not spaces, which made getting in/out of spaces very difficult. We were charged £12 for 24 hours, but there is also another car park round the back, which I believe is not owned by the hotel. We arrived at about 1.30pm and there was a very long queue at check in, where they were checking in a large group. This took up most of the reception area so it was very messy and noisy and we ended up waiting 20-30 mins for check in. The room itself was quite small, but very very warm. We had paid extra for the ""park view"" room, but this was nothing more than a bit of grass in a small area next to a church which does not even exist anymore! Definitely mis sold that and would not recommend paying extra for this. The air conditioning doesn't work very well and half the time, didn't even seem to be on as it kept turning itself off. Bathroom was small as well, but the shower was powerful. Although the Apple TV looked good, it was too small to use as a TV as well. I have neck problems, so when I saw the pillows were too soft for me, I called reception and asked if they had memory foam pillows. I was told they only had synthetic or feather pillows which were already in my room - both were so soft combined with the soft mattress meant my husband and I had a very bad back and neck in the morning! Very surprised the hotel did not have more of a variety of pillows, thought this would be quite a common request especially for Hilton hotels and even more so, as another hotel chain even offers a pillow menu to choose from! The hotel did not seem to keep the large group on one floor, as they were very noisy in the middle of the night and woke us up a few times talking and running up and down the corridor very loudly. Breakfast was ok the next morning, but again due to the large group, there were not many tables available and the queue for the food was very long. The location of the hotel is just outside the main city centre, so does take some time to walk in - maybe about 10 minutes, depending where you wanted to go. The area itself is very quiet and not much around. Overall, only ok stay, would have expected more from Hilton and probably would not stay here again.","0","","2015-04-30","2015-04-25","2015-04-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r267846577-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was of a good standard and the glazed windows kept out all of the traffic noise from outside, allowing a good night's sleep. Unfortunately I was not able to use the hotel parking due to it being full and had to use a city council operated car park instead. Other than that, I would stay again.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/bd/e8/c4/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg","2015-04-30","2015-04-22","2015-04-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r267337429-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was smart and well decorated in a modern style, with an Apple PC in the room to be used (and abused!). 
Only minor complaint was that the A/C wasn't very cool at all, and although that was not especially a problem now, I imagine that it would be when it gets warmer. 

For the price paid, it was good value - but there was nothing outstanding to warrant the 5th Star.

Great breakfast, although a bit of s queue, but only because all the eggs are cooked fresh to order.

I rang to complain and was spoken to by the duty manager frank 
He gave no apology and even suggested it is a bar and it happens and just dismissed the complaint
If this happens they give a guarantee if they don't keep u satisfied then don't pay so I rang down and spike to reception again and said frank dismissed my complaint and I was not paying 
He then came to my room and agreed to take my food off the Bill and change my room so to avoid the noise from this group

The hotel and its interior are lovely, very modern, well designed and clean. Room was tidy and included everything it said on the description of the room when booking, such as hairdryer, tea/coffee making facilities and toiletries (which were replaced every day once used). Plenty of space for everything i.e. size of the room, plenty of drawer space. Nice big soft bed for a lovely night’s sleep, each room is sound proofed so the only noise you could hear outside was people in the hallway and opening/closing room doors.
The only issue we had was the parking. The car park is tiny!!! We arrived around 7pm on a Friday evening and managed to have the last car parking space. When we were checking in we were asked if we drove/how many nights we would be staying and was told we would be charged £12 parking fee per night. The following morning we wanted to explore but had to go back inside to ask at reception for a car park barrier ticket to actually leave the hotel via car. When we came back in the afternoon no parking spaces at all, this resulted in us having to search for another car park nearby (luckily the hotel is near the city center). We were warned by the friendly lady on reception that we might have trouble getting a space on our return and if so to try the car park around the back (not owned by the hotel), which was a maximum stay of 4 hours at a time plus a fee – obviously no good. She also informed us that they would happily refund any car parking fees if we were unable to find a space – no hassle at all; they even invoiced the refund for me for my bank records and delivered it to our room.
I would recommend the hotel as the staff were lovely and the room and location was great.","0","","2015-02-28","2015-03-23","2015-03-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r261224604-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I have stayed several times already at the hotel in 2015 and will be continuing to do so throughout the year.

The rooms are excellent: clean and stylish, as is the breakfast. The fitness room is also a nice bonus and the location is handy for the station and a short walk from many pubs and restaurants. However the thing that really makes the hotel is the staff - from the friendly greeting at reception to the housekeeping staff to the bar and breakfast teams, everyone is so friendly, professional and welcoming, and all look like they really enjoy being there and part of the team. It is really refreshing to see and has meant I would never consider trying another hotel in Bristol. 

I followed up with a stay in the Birmingham Garden Inn last week and whilst the facilities are similar, the hotel is let down slightly as it does not have the same buzz about the staff: they could learn a lot from all at Bristol. many thanks.","1","","2015-03-31","2015-03-22","2015-03-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r261132027-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

There are a couple of significant negatives however. Don't bother bringing your cat as you wont be able to swing it, not even a kitten.The room size is tiny,the  bed size which is equally tiny is just a double, standing in the bathroom, I could touch all four walls and the car park is likewise tiny, so don't expect a parking space as there probably wont be any.

Upon arrival the reception were so friendly that you really felt welcome from the get go, it is a clean and welcoming entrance and a Mac on the reception to for you to use for emails if need be. The were very informative and really gave us all the information we needed. 

Upon my request / booking I asked for a quiet room and that's what we got. It was quiet all the time which is rare these days in a lot of hotels. 

The room, although upon first entrance looks small really isn't At all. It's for a lot more space then you think and the computer chairs, and the Mac really made a lovely touch. The windows are big and have lovely views and the bathroom is clean modern and very nice. 

The only little thing I would say is that one of the chairs in the room was in the centre of the carpet and would be better placed at the side as it is too heavy to move and if you get up at night it may hit your foot or walk into it. I found the bed a tad hard at first but they are actually very comfortable. 

We also had dinner in the restaurant the staff were very friendly and the food was lovely. Really recommend the muscles as the Hilton really know how to flavour them well. 

Overall a really nice hotel, welcoming, such nice staff and if you want somewhere which is near the city centre but also far enough away to be relaxing I really recommend it ","0","","2015-03-31","2015-03-11","2015-03-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r258894164-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

","I stayed here the night before an exam which was taking place in the building next door. I was looking for somewhere I could revise and have a good night's sleep and this hotel provided this. I was in room 109 overlooking the main road but I found there was no disturbance as the windows are well soundproofed. I slept really well in the comfortable bed, even with pre-exam nerves. 
The room was pleasantly decorated and I was impressed with the TV system, quality toiletries, powerful hairdryer and well stocked tea/coffee making facilities. 
There were a few aspects that could be improved to have made this a very good stay. The bathroom door and tiles were dirty in places and I had to clean them with toilet roll. The bathroom door could actually benefit from being repainted. There were hairs in the shower. The skirting boards were topped with a layer of thick dust. I also found the room to be too warm and the air con system too loud and ineffective. 
On the plus side the staff were all friendly and helpful. I had dinner in the cafe/bar which was tasty and reasonably priced, and breakfast was good too. 
I will return in January for the night before my next exam.

Only had a couple of problems, the duvets are super thin. And the heating/air con system noisy. Also the bed is on cannisters, it moved with every movement. And as a restless sleeper it was quite irritating. 

Also a big flaw. I rang earlier in the day to confirm they accepted my bank card (not everywhere does). Was informed they did accept it so not to worry. Only to get there and have it declined with ""bad format"" because they don't accept that card type. Not an issue, paid cash. But still embarrassing and frustrating.

Rooms are on small side with very small but compact en suite. TV is integrated into Mac PC in room, This results in small , 24 inch screen , very slow when changing channels and poor picture quality.Heard another guest in bar complaining about TV. Please put normal TV in rooms. Surprised that there was no bath robes or slippers , no mini bar or heated towel rail in bathroom.These are usual in 4 star hotels.
Car park was full so had to park in public car park just across road.This shuts at 6.00 pm so your car stays in there until 7.00 am next morning. All in all , perfectly adequate hotel but more three star than four.","0","","2015-02-28","2015-03-02","2015-03-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r257244224-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms are of an average size for city centre and very well equipped including air conditioning, ironing board and Mac computer amongst the usual items you would expect. Free Wifi and the bed was very comfy but suffered from the thin duvet syndrome you tend to find in a lot of new hotels.
If I was being picky, the bathroom was on the small side with not much room to maneuver. No bath either.
Didn't eat here in the evening but the buffet style breakfast was very good.
There are parking spaces available that you have to pay for although they were full so parked in a pay and display just down the road which is free between 18.00 and 8.00 payable before and after that. Beware I think the barrier is locked at night.

Wouldn't recommend ","Not a good stay,  with all the options on bristol I won't bother with this hotel again.
We were kept waiting in reception for half an hour with all our bags whilst they struggled to find out booking and said without a confirmation email we wouldn't have a room and they were fully booked! Rooms had been paid for in advance so was worried about where my money had gone! Eventually they realised they had booked another guest in already under our name! Throughout this half hour there wasn't much reassurance that the situation would be resolved, no refreshments were offered whilst we stood at the desk for half an hour eventually after really complaining we were offered some vouchers for a free ""house wine "" at the bar which we then struggled to drink as we were now running late for our dinner reservation! 
Also their car park was full do they recommended one just down the road but the payment times are between 8am an 6pm everyday and you can't pay in advance meaning after a night out in had to get up at 745 get dressed and how back to the car to put a new ticket on!!! Seriously unimpressed with this from a supposedly 4* hotel!  
The cleaners had clearly been taking a rest in our room as when we got in there was a random piece of lemon cake on the bed (no other selection of biscuits or cakes in our room or our friends so assuming it wasn't ment to be there!) it was next to the TV remote on the side of the bed with a nearly empty bottle of gator aid on the side and a still slightly warm hot water bottle in the bed!!! 
Also no bottled water in the rooms and was £1.50 for a small bottle from reception,  again for a 4* hotel charging £130+ per night in find this and really poor effort! 
And don't be fooled by the name it really isn't city centre, I wouldn't suggest you could walk to the city centre for the restaurant /bars you need a taxi!

The hotel itself is perfectly located to town center and easy to access from the M23, the rooms are very clean and bright. We had dinner with friends in the restaurant and we were all very impressed with our meal, the food is beautifully presented, very tasty and prices are very reasonable. The staff were very professional, courteous and welcoming throughout.  We had had a similar experience at breakfast were once again we were very well looked after by the breakfast staff and the food was very good. 
Thank you for a great weekend. Looking forward to our next visit.","0","","2015-02-28","2015-02-12","2015-02-12","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r253865010-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The bed was the worst bed I've ever slept in!!!!!!!!

It was so hard that I saw every hour tick by. I ask reception if we could move to a softer bed after night one but they didn't have any, the lovely receptionist did say she could get someone to put a quilt over the mattress. But upon our return from an evening out that didn't happen. :( so 2 nights of little sleep!! 

£24 for car parking at the hotel is extortionate and really needs to be lowered. And the food & drinks in the bar were too expensive!! £4.70 for a single short and mixer!! And £15 for a burger and chips (with shop bought coleslaw and plastic cheese)!! I'd understand restaurant prices in the restaurant but not in the bar!! 

That said the service was excellent, the staff really friendly (the lady making the eggs for breakfast definitely made my day, she was polite and funny)

The hotel has everything that can be expected of an economically priced hotel. The lobby is clean and modern and staffed 24 hours. There are good lifts to all floors. There is a restaurant on the ground floor, which also serves breakfast. 

I stayed in a room on the 3rd floor, it was quiet and a reasonable size. The room was equipped with a comfortable bed, alarm clock and iMac, which doubled as a telly. There was free internet access, both wired via the iMac and wifi. There was air conditioning. The room was clinically clean. 

The bathroom was equipped with a spacious shower but no tub. There was a range of nice toiletries to sample. 

The staff were friendly and welcoming and efficient and professional at all times.

The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads Station and about a 20 minute walk from the harbour area, where restaurants and so forth can be found. 

All in all I found my stay to be completely faultless and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a problem-free, comfortable stay.

First impressions were of a simple unsophisticated hotel and a very efficient and friendly welcome from the front desk staff. The best rooms are at the back looking over the ""park"" and we usually go for a high floor as they seem quieter. The room was well furnished and although small, the bathroom was more than adequate with a good shower and quality toiletries. There was a free safe, fridge, tea and coffee and even an Apple Mac computer that doubled up as a television. I did find the bed too firm for me, but my husband slept like a log. There was a bit of confusion over the pillows, as I had requested foam instead of the feather ones. Unfortunately housekeeping didn't know the difference between the 2 and had to make several trips to our room, and even then we were left with 2 feather ones.
The package we were on included breakfast and dinner, which did not disappoint. Although we were the only ones using the restaurant between 6.30 and 8pm. The food was well cooked and presented and again the staff very attentive. Breakfast was the usual fayre and again well presented with eggs being freshly cooked and staff on hand. 
There are no real negatives for this hotel, although the parking at £12 a day could be an issue at the busy times as it is quite limited. We will definitely return to this hotel next time we are in Bristol.","0","","2015-01-31","2015-01-26","2015-01-26","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r251071120-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

What you would expect as a frequent Hilton customer - ironing board in room, tea and coffee, complementary water and toiletries.  The in room TV was an Apple computer and had Sky Sports and full browser, very impressed with this! Good location close to main train station and still within 10 minute walk to the main centre. Only minor point for me was breakfast - scrambled egg was full of cream and almost pureed! But then again, the leisure traveller may like this but for someone who stays 3 nights a week, you get a bit sick of the full cooked breakfast.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/39/e5/90/apple-tv-with-sky-sports.jpg","2015-01-31","2015-01-20","2015-01-20","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r250205638-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 5","Great Hotel, Superb Service & Excellent Food","This was my first visit to the Hilton Garden Inn Bristol. After my journey by train to Temple Meads Station, the hotel is just a five minute (or less) walk away.

It is a modern design, with a bus stop outside the hotel, which takes you in to the city centre. It is also a stop for the open top bus service that runs from March to December.

I was warmly welcomed to the hotel, my Hilton HHonors silver status recognised (a nice touch) & I was in my top floor room (5th floor), within moments. I suspect this was aided by the fact that I had checked in online via the Hilton HHonors app on my phone & had chosen my exact room.

By the very nature of the building, space is at a premium, so bedrooms are compact (if you want a large bedroom space, this hotel is not for you), but more than adequately serve their purpose. A small, but well equipped bathroom, comprises a power shower, toilet & sink. In the bedroom you'll find an excellent bed, iron/ironing board, hair dryer, tea & coffee making facilities as well as an Apple Mac TV/Computer (left over from when the hotel was a City Inn/Mint Hotel). With free, workable WiFi, you could not ask for more. After all, you are not staying in the room 24/7. Two bottles of water were waiting for me in the room, in recognition of my Hilton HHonors status.

Rooms are spotless, but that has to be said for the entire hotel, which is looked after with care & attention to detail.

I had booked a dinner, bed & breakfast rate, as this served my needs. I went down to dinner at about 7.30pm, was warmly greeted & shown to a table. The restaurant had a very pleasant atmosphere & there is an adjoining bar which also serves a range of snacks.

My three-course table d'hote meals on both nights were excellent, with great portion sizes, & were chosen from a range of options offered. Food quality was superb, as was presentation. Where relevant, food was served hot, as you would expect. Beverages are not overly expensive, a plus for a city centre hotel.

Breakfast was offered buffet style, & a member of staff shows you to a table & goes through the wide range of hot & cold options on offer. There is a menu offering cooked to order dishes as well. A chef offers excellent service at a live kitchen, cooking eggs to order. Her interaction with guests is quite brilliant & is a must see if you can.

For both mornings I was there, I opted for the porridge, followed by a three egg omelette (with cheese, mushroom & tomatoes). Both were piping hot & served separately, as well as being cooked to perfection. 

Staff are very attentive, continuously bringing round a choice of tea & coffee. Nothing is too much trouble.

The hotel is located within easy reach of all that Bristol has to offer & can be reached by bus or on foot.

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, as it ticks all the boxes you may have, as well as offering very decent room rates too.

Well done to all members of staff. It's a pleasure to be looked after by such caring people.","2","","2015-01-31","2015-01-11","2015-01-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r248853500-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Some might find the double beds not quite big enough...just a thought. The location is fairly good, if you know where you are going! The car park is tight, but we managed it ok.

While this hotel doesn't have a pool and is a little further from town it is more modern and well equipped and has free wi-fi so get's my vote as the better of the two.

Rooms are not huge but have everything you need and are well laid out. The inclusion of an Apple iMac for TV, internet and computing is a great idea and a real winner with me.

The bar and restaurant are again not huge but food was very good when I stayed and service was excellent. In fact staff across the whole hotel were really friendly and helpful.

I didn't use the gym so can't comment.

Car parking is limited and while I just about managed to squeeze into the last space I'm sure those arriving later than me had to follow directions to nearby fee paying car-parks.","0","","2014-12-31","2014-12-15","2014-12-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r244526392-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We were quickly dealt with by reception and made our way to our room via the lift. The room was excellent, everything was immaculate and clean. There was all new equipment with a computer doubling up as a TV, a sophisticated radio alarm system and telephone. The bathroom was well appointed and clean. The beds were very comfortable with a choice of hard/soft pillows. Despite facing the main road we could not here a sound from the traffic due to the very efficient triple glazing. The evening meal was a buffet with a choice of soup or pate and then a choice of 3 main courses followed by a large portion of fruit salad. There was a wide choice of things for breakfast but I didn't like the coffee! I was perfectly happy with my stay at the Hilton but some other members of our group complained of some rowdy people making excessive noise from 10pm until 2am in the morning which kept them awake. However they did not complain to reception who I am sure would have sorted the problem out.","0","","2014-12-31","2014-12-08","2014-12-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r243528687-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Very good location. Barely 10 min walk to Cabot Centre. 
If I have to provide a critique it would be the limitation of parking places at the hotel site, when special occasions are taking place. That said, the staff does direct you to a free overnight public car park around the corner.

Rooms are a reasonable size and are very well equipped - an iMac in the room provides TV/radio/internet/etc. Bed was very comfortable. En-suite shower rooms are small but fine.
Parking is advertised but space is limited - we had to use the public car park behind the hotel, which actually worked out cheaper than the hotel's parking charge.

The IMac was a welcome and useful feature as was the free wifi. The chair in the room was very comfortable for desk working and after a quick google I will have to save my pennies for one! The fittings in this Hotel are 1st class Grohe, Porcelanosa, Matki &  Apple amongst others and yet the room rate I paid was very reasonable.

We were on the park side with a view across to the ruined Temple Church. As with many Bristol hotels parking is a chargeable extra (£12) and its not a large car park - we were lucky and got the only space on a saturday afternoon. 
We had a Queen Room Park View - an upgrade (thanks!). The room was a reasonable size, had a shower but no bath, a fridge for storing goodies if you wished, free WiFi and a Mac for TV / entertainment/ info. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and we didn't hear a thing from any other guests.

We were served by a fine gentleman named Courtney who took time to speak to us.

The following morning we had breakfast in the hotel which was lovely. The lady at the egg station (Jane) was a delight and brightened up my morning with her spirit, passion and energy.

Overall the staff were friendly and attentive and my only feedback to the hotel is that the check out process was longer than I expected.

Reception was very friendly and welcoming.

The twin room was pretty pokey but clean, modern and fresh. It's a good job we knew each other well as it was difficult to get to the wardrobe on the far side of the room without having to dodge out of the way of each other. I guess a double might have a little more circulation space. The aircon was rubbish - even on its coolest setting it didn't cool down much and was a bit fuggy when we woke up. I've just reead the last four reviews and they all say the same - clearly something the management ought to sought out - when we mentioned it on check out the check out guy didn't bat an eyelid. The shower was a bit feeble, not much power or volume of water but it did the job.

Despite those issues - which given it's supposed to be a 'four' star hotel and it cost us £140 I don't expect - we had a good stay there. Staff were friendly and efficient, wifi worked well (hooray, a hotel that doesn't charge for wifi and it actually works!), the breakfast was very good (fresh, rather than all from a catering pack!) and we both had a very comfortable night's sleep. 

Will stay there again, gladly but would look for a bit of a deal on the price if I could.","0","","2014-11-30","2014-11-08","2014-11-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r238785892-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Upon arrival the lady on reception (surname Bennett) was very friendly and chatty and remarked on our anniversary and offered us a glass of champagne in the bar. We thought this was a nice touch, however was a little disappointed to be told once inside the bar that they had run out of Champagne. This I did not believe, it was probably more of a matter they had run out of house Champagne. Instead we were each offered a glass of wine. 

We stayed in one of the Queen Evolution Park View rooms. Admittedly the room was smaller than we expected, but it was very contemporary in it's styling. The bathroom was also on the small side, but acceptable for our short stay. The bed we thought would be too firm to enjoy a good nights sleep. However neither of us woke up with aches and pains and both had a pleasant nights sleep. The linen was of a good quality and spotlessly clean. We also liked the Mac TV/Computer set up. The air con in the room didn't seem to work, it made a noise but didn't seem to do much else. However, we didn't have the need to fully utilise this and therefore didn't hinder our stay. 

We paid for breakfast to be included. Breakfast had a vast selection of hot and cold options. However, be careful of the sausages, I had 3 sausages and 1 was raw.

Don't overlook the hotel website when booking this hotel. We found a better on their website compared to what the likes of booking.com etc were offering.

Others mention the convenient positioning of this hotel, near Temple Meads rail station.Visitors armed with a pass will find buses are in abundance and stop right outside the hotel, taking you into the centre of town. We travelled in to the hotel by bus from Devizes and find the Hilton Garden Inn hotel great for us.
Breakfast, buffet style - one of the best, the fruit is mouth watering and fresh. Hot dishes are well catered for though as with any busy hotel dishes require constant topping up, patience again.
One thing should be considered by management is the `pathways` staff use to get to the kitchen, because they cross over the very same that persons use when attempting to reach the foods.
Must mention that these staff work extremely hard and are very good at giving you what you want and clearing `done` dishes. The `Breakfast` manager, again there last year, is so cheerful, inviting and well organised.
Did not have evening meal so cannot comment.
Bedroom -  Air Con, could blow a little colder. Windows, you can open them, great if you're claustraphobic like me.
En-suite - was sparkling clean. The shower was perhaps the safest we've used, floor is as it should be, non-slip. Room 515.
Staff - it was noticeable that staff at Reception, and serving in the Breakfast area were working here a year ago, perhaps a sign that management has got it right.
Reception - at times very busy, this is a bustling vibrant hotel, so patience and tolerance is often required by visitors and staff. Receptionists are multi-lingual.","0","","2014-11-30","2014-11-04","2014-11-04","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r238045930-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was well appointed, although a bathtub would have been most welcome. We were not offered an upgrade, as requested at the time of booking, so we soldiered on, but, the breakfast was fabulous and the atmosphere was very relaxed with outdoor  dining offered for smokers as an option. 
We were greeted by a very helpful and friendly staff in the bar/dining room by a very welcoming yung man, named Peotr who concocted for us two delicious cocktails and attended to our needs with the utmost professionalison as one would expect from any 5 star hotel.nhe was friendly and helpful.  Our second evening was delightful with a lovely meal served by a smiling lady by the name of Grace, who had us giggling in no time, and served us a sumptuous meal, it was a wonderful weekend, with lots of laughs and giggles , thanks to the serving staff in the bar and dinng room, many thanks, we had a lovely time","1","","2014-10-31","2014-10-31","2014-10-31","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r237329958-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Check in was easy and the rooms although small are clean  and after all when you are a tourist you are not spending all your time in a bedroom. It was an added bonus to have an onsite guest laundry as well. 
  The buffet breakfast is quite good but it is two young ladies at the front desk Lucy and Adele
who really demonstrated the service one comes to expect from a Hilton hotel. As we were unable to process our boarding passes (as we are not comfortable with doing that) they went out of their way to accommodate us by taking care of it for us even though it is usually the job of the guests. This was done with both efficiency and a courtesy. Well done!","0","","2014-10-31","2014-10-27","2014-10-27","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r236637461-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Amenities were good quality, size of the room small, wireless worked ok wich is refreshing for a hotel, and free!
Breakfast in a small room but sufficient for the number of guests and with enough choices and nice service from staff. Reception was very helpfull. Parking was full but found that other cars find a way to park outside the normal areas, which is tolerated, so there are more spaces than the ones one would think. Also possible to park outside for free on Sundays, so one can save for a cider in the local pub :)","0","","2014-10-31","2014-10-21","2014-10-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r235591831-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Have stayed at this hotel over the last few months and it clearly demonstrates 'best practise' in many areas.Accommodation,food and facilities tick all the boxes but its the people factor that stands out above all the rest.
i was priveleged to witness the restaurant and bar staff's genuine duty of care with a non sighted guest over 2 late dinners.Nothing was too much trouble and it was humbling to see such sincere professionalism.
So well done to Paulo,Alex,Juan and Aga who have excelled in customer care and should be recognized for their efforts.
I do not usually write reviews but this team were exceptional to say the least.
Following on from last week I discussed the introduction of alternate 'real ales' from the local area as the lager range are not my choice (its an acquired taste!) with Courtney ( a learned student of beer) from behind the bar.Thank you for refreshing attitude to further improve the Hilton experience.

Due to getting a new job and the training overlapping I needed to see if i could see the dates. I contacted the hotel prior to travel and spoke to both Maz and Kriztina who went above and beyond to assist in this matter and are most certainly a credit to both the hilton and the hotel. Prior to arrival I had mentioned it was to celebrate my Mams Birthday on arrival they had placed us a lovely cake and complimentary vouchers for a drink in the bar, a very lovely touch. The lady on reception Annie couldn't have done more to help during our stay and was always on hand to help. The hotel is fairly easy to get too from the hotel with the airport bus stopping directly outside the airport and dropping off right outside the hotel, this is £11 return and an easy journey. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk out of the main centre and Cabot Circus. The rooms are nice, comfortable, very clean and were the usually Hilton standards, the toiletries in the bathroom are also a nice touch and every room has an I-mac which are good for a bit tv / music. The rooms aren't huge but they are all you need for a stay, we had 2 chairs in our room and in all honest would probably have been better with 1 as this took up quite a bit of space. The only negative point was when we arrived we had a problem getting our toilet to flush, we did mention this on our way out and the girl on reception said she would send someone to have a look, when we returned it appeared to the be the same, it did not spoil our stay but it was a little annoying. We opted for breakfast for our stay and very glad we did, there was a vast choice, staff were very friendly, food was delicious and there is also fresh eggs and a waffle maker available. The wifi was also free and really useful.Overall the hotel was great, and the staff are a real credit to the place. I would recommend this hotel and would stay again.","0","","2014-10-31","2014-10-16","2014-10-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r234680094-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We were allocated a room on the 4th floor looking out onto the main road. Even though it was a busy main road, the room was very quiet. We had a twin room, with fridge and safe, very comfortable beds, crisp white bed linen, and very comfy pillows. There was a large chair in the bedroom, which we had to keep moving around to get to the wardrobe. Our toilet was not flushing properly, we did report this to reception, but it was not fixed whilst we had the room, however as we didnt spend a lot of time in the hotel, it did not spoil anything, it was just an irritation. The breakfasts were very good, lots of choice and, served hot. With eggs cooked to order. The staff in the restaurant were all very nice and polite. One lady in particular, who worked on reception, was so lovely, I think her name was Annie Lundgren, she took an interest in where we had been sightseeing, gave us loads of hints and tips, helped us with buses, she was very knowledgeable. And she certainly went out of her way to do all she could to make our stay a good one. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Would recommend if you're happy to be a bit out of the hustle and bustle of the city centre.

Check-in was efficient and quick. The rooms are very clean and modern with an Apple TV/computer which is useful if you need to work. The rooms have fridges, which is a rare and appreciated commodity, as well as lovely toiletries in the bathrooms. The bed is also high up and exceptionally comfy. Only downside is that the windows don't open (or at least mine didn't appear to) and the air conditioning isn't that effective.

Only had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and it was fine. Nothing truly exceptional aside from the waffles. The bar looked nice but wasn't that big so can't imagine relaxing in there for too long. The meeting room facilities were excellent and staff were very helpful.

All in all it was an excellent place to stay for what we needed and I wouldn't hesitate to go back.","1","","2014-09-30","2014-09-29","2014-09-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r231552940-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room lights (bedside) weren't plugged in and I couldn't untangle them to plug them in ,the night light didn't work .all these are details that make it a 4star and should be in place , a good housekeeper should stand in the room after cleaning and ask her self would a guest find the more comfortable than home could they navigate around in the dark . Overnight parking was 12.50 and the hotels spaces are in an adjoining NCP it's difficult to navigate from this to the hotel reception .we were offered a special deal for the evening meal £20 inc wine ,we would liked to have read through the menu in our room ,but there wasn't any menus in the room , or magazines or any other Bristol literature ,I've never experienced that in  a city centre hotel .this hotel needs to try a lot harder ,I was visiting on a complimentary night ,with them because I had complained previously .about an Xmas party booking ,they haven't  improved at all ..sorry to say .","0","","2014-09-30","2014-09-27","2014-09-27","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r231148924-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is located only a few minutes away from the centre of the city so it is easy to walk to the attractions. The room was lovely and had all the facilities we needed. We thought the breakfast was fantastic and the service there was very good. All the staff we met were very friendly and efficient. 

Unfortunately. when we arrived to check-in a large hen party of around 30 people was also checking in. They were very noisy at this time and a little noisy during the night. The staff did their best to check everyone in as efficiently as possible but the lobby was crowded and we had to queue for a little while. They had also plastic glasses for champagne, which were left lying around broken outside (but were cleaned up quickly). Obviously the prospect of the noise and disruption slightly spoiled the rest of our stay. I think that knowing hen/stag parties are allowed at the hotel would make us slightly reluctant to stay here again or recommend it just in case we were unlucky enough to experience it again. My partner was also disappointed the usual Hilton cookies or fudge were not available on check-in. These are the reasons I have only given the hotel 4 stars. 

Tips for things to do
We ate at an Italian restaurant called Bella Vista, which was less than 10 mins from the hotel on the river and had a fantastic evening.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/9b/0b/49/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg","2014-09-30","2014-09-21","2014-09-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r230127492-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Arrived to a group of 4 (men) playing football outside main entrance with a golf ball whilst swigging from a bottle of vodka and cans.  Had to then sit in reception for half an hour whilst upwards of 20 hens checked in.  During this time the golf ball kept hitting the glass door of the hotel which alongside the noise from both inside and out made us very uneasy about our upcoming stay.  The 'stags' then proceeded to their 5th floor room, one very nearly vomitting whilst waiting for the lift.  Once my partner checked in I was mortified to find we were on 5th floor and then even more mortified to find we were next door to stag do which was clearly audible from corridor.  We did not even open room door but rather returned to reception.  The lady at reception was incredibly helpful and offered us another room on 5th floor which we would have to wait half an hour for.  Given two rooms on 5th floor were taken up with stag do we were not keen on this idea.  Next offered 4th floor but informed most of hen party on this floor 'and they were worse than the boys'.  By this time we had lost the will to check in at all and so cancelled the reservation and left.  I realise no hotel can be responsible for its quests behavious but to allow people to check in swigging alcohol and obviously drunk at 4 oclock in the afternoon is surely asking for trouble.  As I said the lady at reception tried to accommodate us even offering to try and book us at another Hilton, however by this time we really had seen enough and decided we were better off at home.","3","","2014-09-30","2014-09-15","2014-09-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r229000879-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 3","Room was pleasant but smaller than expected.","I stayed at this hotel on 28th August 2014. We arrived before our check out time which was meant to be 3.00. I had booked through last minute.com and requested an earlier check in. When we got there they seemed to be quite behind with the cleaning of the rooms and hadn't really made any effort to try and accommodate the request made through last minute.com. However the receptionist said she would sort the problem and to sit in the cafe and she will let us know when our room would be ready in about 30 minutes. We were pleased with this but after about 1 hour waiting in the cafe i went back to reception and the lady had gone and someone new was there who said was very unlikely. After explaining my frustrations after about another 20/30 minutes we were shown to our room. 

One of the 2 lifts was being repaired and so the wait was long, as we were on floor 2 and only had an over night bag we took the stairs which was fine.
The room was so much smaller and darker than advertised in the picture. This was very disappointing as the picture on the website was stunning. I have attached their picture and then mine.

I am sure if i hadn't seen the picture i wouldn't have been so disappointed but i was and the bathroom was incredibly small. As small as what you may have as a downstairs bathroom. You definitely couldn't fit more than one person at a time.

All of this aside, the room was quiet and we had a park/garden view which was lovely, much nicer than the other side which was a road and a carpark. Bed was very comfy. Room was a little warm and the air con which we had to keep on sounded like a helicopter landing in the room.

The TV was a mac computer which was ok, maybe a bit difficult for some people to use but it did the job.

A good location, we managed a walk into down and a ferry back which is the best way to travel.
I would say if you were travelling alone this room would be ideal. For a couple a little small.

I have to say however they did give us an extra hour free late check out. I think it should have been £15 per hour after 12.00.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/91/58/c7/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

Hotel was full, a number of hen and stag groups were staying, but these didm't spoil our stay. We had a room at the end of a corridor which may have avoided passing traffic overnight. We also had a room on the back of the hotel, I think they refer to it as a ""garden view"" and we found this to be very quiet. We may have got this due to our HHonors Gold status which was recognised through the free breakfast. We did have to surrender the 750 points we would've earned but I'd rather the breakfast which is valued at £15 per person. Wouldn't have paid this for the breakfast, but it was very nice to have it (cooked English breakfast). Rooms are well appointed with Apple Mac used as the TV. Connected to JBL speaker system which you can play music through when getting ready for a night out. Shower pressure a bit poor, but ok for a one night stay. Air conditioning in the room was ok. Didn't manage to get it properly cold, but it wasn't as hot last weekend so we were comfortable.
Rooms are small, but ok for 2 people. We had friends round for pre-night out drinks and it was a bit cosy with 4 people in.
Car parking space is limited and expensive at £12 for 24 hours. We went for it, but there are little alternative choices. Left the car in the car park on the Sunday to walk to Cabot Circus and utilise the full 24 hours.
Through no fault of the hotel, BOTH lifts were out of order. I saw some elderly residents struggling down the stairs on Sunday morning. We are young, fit and healthy and were thankful for our level 1 room. 
Would recommend staying at the HGI Bristol City Centre. A Clean, tidy, well priced hotel for the facilities.","0","","2014-08-31","2014-09-01","2014-09-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r225918216-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The good news: it still has the same ambience - clean, smart (albeit small) rooms with an Apple Mac for TV, surfing, films, etc. The staff were helpful and friendly.

The less good news: what made the City Inn special was the outstanding quality of the food. The food is still good, but not as good as the old days. However, we had a good rate that included breakfast and evening meal. The other downside (apart from a shortage of parking which cost £12 per day) is the bland wall-paper music that plays continuously in the lobby.","0","","2014-08-31","2014-08-28","2014-08-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r225079914-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms are quite standard and nothing special but they were clean which is the main thing, there are imacs in the room instead of tvs and very nice toiletries in the bathroom.  The beds are comfy, however I would recommend bringing your own pillows they are very hard and about half the size of a normal pillow?? At breakfast they wouldn't accommodate us in the main breakfast room as there were 8 of us even though they could have moved tables instead we shoved out in the bar area which meant we had to walk past people waiting to sit down to get our breakfast.  Breakfast was average, what you expect from a hotel breakfast. All in all a nice hotel and a good location from the centre.

Sleep Quality: 3","Serviceable, but fine","I used to live in Bristol and decided to stop over in the City as part of a longer trip - this was a fairly last minute booking (am Hilton Diamond so chain of choice).  The location is relatively central, but the hotel does sit on a main road and is not in one of the nicer/older parts of Bristol but an easy walk to most of the City. The biggest issue on arrival was lack of parking with few other choices nearby - luckily a car left and I grabbed their slot, but paid a hefty price for the privilege! 
Rooms are relatively small and in need of a refresh, but I did get a higher floor at the back so that was fine and fairly quiet (late Friday night) although the room was hot and I needed to keep window open. 
Breakfast on Saturday morning was very busy and the buffet ran out of various items while I was trying to get served - I did spot a not so silver service event - the 'chef' bringing out supplies of baked beans noticed some spillage on the rim of the dish, so kindly used his finger to swipe them back in with the rest of them!! 
This hotel is fine, but I'm not sure for anyone spending more than a day or so in Bristol this would be the ideal base - definitely felt more like an overnight place. I also noticed that pricing varies - room was £129 when I booked relatively last minute, I've seen other reviewers with much lower prices so I think my rating/review reflects this.","0","","2014-08-31","2014-08-25","2014-08-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r224233088-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

On the minus side the bathroom door would not lock and it took several goes to flush the toilet. £12 for car parking is also excessive. Can't comment on the food as we ate out. Would probably stay there again.","1","","2014-07-31","2014-08-19","2014-08-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r222835216-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The breakfast was reasonable although only served until 10am on weekdays. The tea and coffee was sat stewing on a table and the tea tasted of coffee. Would be better if hot water was provided with tea bags. 

The less good points were the street noise on Saturday night (even on the top floor) and some early morning maintenance work. The room was also not as comfortable as it could have been - pretty small with an out of proportion 'princess and the pea' type bed and two chairs taking up space. As leisure travellers, we would also have preferred a proper TV which you could turn off from the bed to the iMac.","1","","2014-08-31","2014-08-18","2014-08-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r222716565-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The second evening a group of boys checked in (stag do?) and were extremely noisy shouting and slamming doors.  The staff at reception were excellent when we asked to be moved, fearing what they might be like in the early hours of the morning!  However, our new room was next to the lift so we spent all night listening to the lift mechanism.  So a real mixed bag - can't blame the hotel for the other guests and they dealt with our request really well.  However, they did have other hen/stag groups staying there too so if that's not your thing I might think twice about this place.  Suggestion for the mgt team - perhaps have a quiet floor or co locate large groups on the same floors?","0","","2014-08-31","2014-08-11","2014-08-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r221097901-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Free wifi in the rooms, however the connection dropped literally every 30 seconds, on every device I tried to connect, and so was next to useless.

The bed was too hard, as a result I did not sleep very well on the 2 nights I stayed at the hotel.

The tea/coffee had not been restocked since the previous occupants departure, something I didn't realise until early the next morning when trying to make a morning cuppa. So I had to go without until I ventured into the city centre.

The parking was £12 per day too, which I found quite expensive. I think I could have managed to get cheaper parking using publicly available car parks. There were not enough parking bays to fit all of the cars in, we managed to squeeze the car in a non designated bay however.

This is the kind of place you stay in if you are not planning on spending very much time at the hotel.","1","","2014-08-31","2014-08-03","2014-08-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r219271806-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

","The location of this holt is great as it's halfway between Bristol Temple Meads Station and the Cabot Circus Shopping Centre.

It's a modern bright airy building and the rooms are well equipped eg air con, fridge, iron, safe, facilities to make drinks and the highlight for me an iMac with a large screen to use as a TV.

The bed was huge with crisp white sheets and loads of pillows. It was quiet too which resulted in a great night's sleep.

In the morning I enjoyed a hot powerful shower and followed this up with a hearty breakfast in the very pleasant dining room. There was a great choice of food from fresh fruit and cereal to a full English breakfast. It was all available from the buffet although there was also the option to order other dishes eg kippers or smoked salmon and egg.

All the staff I encountered were pleasant, helpful and efficient.

Only stayed one night as I was on a work related trip to Bristol but on the basis of this visit I would definitely stay here again.

However, my pre-arrival requests which included an earlier check in were met and our first visit to a Hilton hotel was a very positive experience. Good, standard size room which fitted all our requirements - good bed, quiet position, in room safe and excellent bathroom facilities. Only a shower is offered which suits us perfectly but if you do this the shower system must be of a sufficient standard which this most certainly was.

For those arriving by train the hotel is in an excellent position for those who don't mind the walk - it is only about  10 minutes or so. Tip: Leave Temple Meads station by the exit marked 'Temple Quay', walk down the path, turn left into 'Friary' and walk to the end to join Temple Way. This cuts out out a fair chunk of the walk including a cobbled section outside the other exit. 

The pre-arrival problem above was addressed during our stay and following completion of a standard hotel online survey - got a personal response from the hotel which I wasn't expecting.

An excellent stay in a very good hotel but please, please answer your e-mails. I hope our next experience in the new Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo is equally as good - we have waived our favourite London Hotel to try this and hope we don't regret our decision!!","0","","2014-07-31","2014-07-28","2014-07-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r217948595-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is a very short walk from Bristol Temple Meads - exit the station from the back exit rather than the front and you are literally across the road.  The hotel is on Temple Way, so it is up and over the bridge to the city centre, quite close to the Cabot (cabbot?) circus shopping centre.  If you exit the hotel at the rear, and walk through the church yard, out the other side is a quaint pub and also a tesco express.  If you fancy a walk, keep walking and you will soon find a bit of Bristol Character.  

It is a great hotel for commuting as the train station is so close, but check where your offices are as there doesnt seem to be much nearby, although close to the city centre

Rooms are all clean and straightforward.  The staff are helpful and friendly as can be, i havent had any problems.","1","","2014-07-31","2014-07-14","2014-07-14","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r215442291-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Walked back to hotel through the historic streets of old Bristol.  There is an interesting park and ruined Church at back of hotel.  Sunday morning we walked all around Bristol Harbourside, brilliant coffee at Bordeau Quay Restaurant.  Water taxi back to centre of Bristol and then a bus to Museum to view the latest Banksy picture.  Visit it before it is sold!  Walked down Park Street and visited The Severn Shed for a coffee and cake and walked back to the hotel for a siesta followed by dinner.

It was also very quiet and overlooked the park behind the hotel. The breakfast was good. On the downside we did not receive a very warm welcome. We arrived early and were just told to come back at 3pm. There was then a big queue and check in was slow. The car park is also very expensive (£12 per day) and small.I would recommend looking for somewhere else nearby that is cheaper. It was 15 mins to the centre of town. If you want to be right in the action there are closer hotels. Overall a good base but we thought it was rather expensive for what we got.","0","","2014-07-31","2014-07-14","2014-07-14","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r215362287-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We arrived at approx 7pm on Friday night. There were no spaces in the car park, however when I went in to ask where else we could park was advised we could park on the white crisscross lines as others had. This was fine, the only slight irritant was getting a phone call on Saturday, when we were out at an attraction the other side of Bristol, from the hotel asking me very politely if I could move my car as another car could not get out. When I explained our situation and asked which car was blocked as we had checked with the hotel we could park there (and there was ample room) it turned out the muppet in the White Audi who had arrived after us the night before (and parked so close to my car I nearly had kittens) had been blocked in by someone just arriving, when they then moved they could get out. Therefore not our fault and easily rectified, the receptionist was very apologetic. 

The room itself was on the fourth floor park side, was a nice size, clean and well presented, the Apple Mac and complimentary wifi was also a real treat. 

The bed was comfy and pillows snugly, the air con worked gone and was easily adjustable. The first night we did hear some sirens and I did wake up, but we then found out the end window behind the curtain was open, once closed no outside noise. 

We did have a problem with the iron not heating up, but when I rang reception they were more than happy to bring up a replacement. 

We also had breakfast, there was a good selection of hot and cold food, the first morning was quieter and very pleasant. It was a bit different this morning being much busier, it felt more rushed, we also missed the friendly local staff we'd had the morning before. 

The location of the hotel is ideal, a couple of minutes walk to Bristol Temple Meads station, and a 15 minute relaxed stroll into the centre. 

We really enjoyed our break in Bristol and will return. ","0","","2014-07-31","2014-07-13","2014-07-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r215203215-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Rooms are reasonably sized for European standards.  The breakfast is fine if you are a gold member and they include it, but I would be mad if I paid £10 for it.  My main complaint was housekeeping.  I complained about them leaving only one towel and rather than address the problem the front desk told me there should be another towel in the wardrobe (there wasn't. ) I ended up needing to leave a note each day asking for a second towel.  They also did not change out dirty glasses. I had to go to the bar each day to ask for a clean glass to drink from. Not really the level of service I expect from a hilton.","1","","2014-07-31","2014-07-13","2014-07-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r215181761-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

There is a bus stop either side of the road with regular buses. On arrival on the Hilton ( which was our first time stayed in a Hilton ) the inside was very small but clean and tidy, we went to the desk to drop our bags off as our room was no ready yet, I have to admit it wasn't the best welcome seems we had to ask for something to say she had oue bags, but she was trying her best, we also decided to have the breakfast which was 10.99...  The room on first look was very small, but was amazed by the Apple TV, but shocked there was 2 chairs in the room ( specially when there was not much small space) the room wasn't very clean or in great condition but the bed was clean and tidy... The rooms needed a good clean and a freshen up, also the air con didn't work very well.. We was on the 4th floor so we expected from the pictures the room would be bigger and at least clean. After spending all day in the town, we went back to the room for a good night sleep, unfortunately  me and my husband found the bed very un-comftable  , mattress was very hard and springy and the pillows felt old and it was really difficult to get comftable on them, when we went down to the desk to enquire about a bill for the breakfast that had been pushed threw our door we did mention we didn't  have a good night sleep, we was asked what the issue was and I mentioned that pillows and the husband the mattress, we was advised we could of asked for a quilt to go underneath the sheet to make it softer, but it was a bit late seems we was only staying one night, and I wasn't willing to walk down to the desk at 2am for the quilt to go under the sheet, The breakfast was ok, I liked the waffles but the breakfast was loop warm, felt sorry for the staff as they seemed to be running around a lot to serve a lot of people. 
The hotel it self was lovely and clean it was very small, and not what I expected from a Hilton, it reminded me to much of a holiday in ( obviously with out the mac )

Check in was quick and simple, we arrived at 3pm and there was no queue. We stayed for a stag do and the hotel were very accommodating. There was also a hen party staying so they had no issues with taking group bookings. 

The room was clean and comfortable with plenty of amenities; kettle, tea/coffee, fridge, safe, iMac computer/TV system and hairdryer. There was also a number of electrical sockets within close proximity to mirrors - we often find that the hairdryer never quite reaches! The bathroom was on the small side but had a great power shower!!

Breakfast was definitely worth having, especially when you get the B&B deal. We noticed that you could buy it at check in for around £15. All the usual stuff, plus a waffle maker which we made full use of.

Having booked this in the Hilton sale, the room was £66 including breakfast which was very reasonable given the alternatives for a Saturday night. We would definitely recommend the hotel and would use it again in the future.","2","","2014-06-30","2014-06-30","2014-06-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r212902677-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Annoying","Stayed here for two nights and there are a lot of positives, the hotel is nicely located, close to Temple Meads railway station and about a 20 minutes walk from then quayside attractions. It's a modern, clean hotel, rooms are small but well equipped and it generally has a quality feel.

However, for what you get it's expensive, the first night was paid for my company, and then my wife joined me for the second night,  we paid £120 for the room, with a tiny bathroom, you pay extra for breakfast and parking, so our total bill was £154, for this you don't get a pool, or gym and the bar area is small.

Only used the restaurant for breakfast, which was typical buffet style and left a lot to be desired, cold and not fresh at all. The staff had all been on the Hilton 'Have a Nice Day' customer service school, and said/ did all the right things but not a glimmer of interest in their customers.

Overall a very disappointing stay, actually quite annoying, but if you want a sterile, no fuss hotel, you'll enjoy it.","0","","2014-06-30","2014-06-29","2014-06-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r212648823-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Check in was quick but when we got to our room it was like walking into a sauna despite the air conditioning unit being set at zero and fan off.  Tried turning it down to -3 and adjusting fan speed but it still threw out hot air. After eating out and coming back to the room, breaking out in a sweat as soon as we entered, I contacted reception. The receptionist came up, tried to adjust it and told us she would reset it back at the front desk and it would take a few minutes to settle.  No it didn't.  Phoned reception and was offered another room. I was told the unit had been switched off but it was still belching out hot air so obviously a fault somewhere. I couldn't have slept there so thank goodness there was another room available.  It was absolute bliss walking into it. Would like to say the staff dealing with this were very helpful and polite throughout.  The hotel itself is very clean with great facilities and a fabulous breakfast and I would definately stay here again if I was in the area. I took a star off as, when we went to dinner (unbooked) I was told there would be a 25 minute wait. That's nothing I thought. After waiting 30mins we were given a table and a menu and then ignored. No-one asked if we wanted drinks. After another 30 mins I had to go and ask someone if we could order. We eventually started eating an hour and a half after we came down.  The restaurant was busy but if we were told at the start it would take that long we would have walked to the harbourside to one of the many restaurants making better use of our time instead of sitting bored. The food was delicious though!!","0","","2014-06-30","2014-06-28","2014-06-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r212505708-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We arrived fairly late (around 9pm) and the hotel car park was full so we parked in the overflow which charges hourly from 8.00am (although free overnight).
The reception staff were great, making check in very quick and explaining our various options (with map) as to how to get to the Uni.
The room was very clean.  The applemac was a nice touch although does not have the best picture quality.  The beds were extremely comfortable and all the linen clean.  The mini bar is not stocked and you can go down to the foyer to buy what you need for a relatively reasonable price.  The hotel has Neutrogena products in the bathroom.
The breakfast was served from 6am and was the usual buffet arrangement which was good.
I was able to move the car to the hotel car park in the morning and the reception staff adjusted my  parking fee (normally £10) accordingly which I thought was a nice touch.
The hotel appeared to be accommodating mainly parents with potential students for the Uni or business people and is ideal for both. 
This hotel is not one to book for a holiday but for an overnight or short stay in a convenient location in Bristol (just off the motorway but in the city) it is ideal.","0","","2014-06-30","2014-06-25","2014-06-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r212073445-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is lovely, in a great location- close to the train station and town centre.

The rooms were very plush and came well-equipped with hair dryers, irons toiletries, shower caps etc, although a little on the small side. We only needed the rooms for a bed and a shower though so the size of the rooms  didn't concern us.

We checked in Saturday the 21st June and checked out on the 22nd. Check in was smooth. And easy. 

All staff were attentive and friendly a willing to help when necessary. 

I can't comment on evening food or lunch as we ate out.
Breakfast was delicious with a huge selection of food, waffles and branded cereals. 

The only issues we encountered with our stay were:

1: The cost of parking (which we were not informed about upon booking) £10 a day!!! Glad we were only there for one night. I believe parking should be inclusive of the price of the hotel. 

2. Myself and my friend who shared a room had issues getting into our room after out night out. Both of the keys didn't work. We could understand if one key didn't work, but both? Unacceptable. Especially as my friend returned back to the hotel  before me and had the issue first (resolved by going to reception at 2am) then I came home later at 3.30am and had the same issue- I didn't think to go to reception, so knocked to wake my friend up to let me in. Really not on. I know I probably could have gone to reception but I shouldn't have been in that situation in the first place... The keys, or at least one of them, should have been working anyway. 

3. My biggest gripe- the air conditioning!!!! It was horrendous!!! I would like to say that it was just the room that I stayed in but as we were part of a hen party we paid for quite a few rooms and everybody had the same issue, the air conditioning did not work in any of the rooms. I can understand that England isn't known for hot temperatures but the weekend we stayed at this hotel is was two very hot summer days on the Saturday and the Sunday. It made sleeping very uncomfortable. I would not return to this hotel unless I knew for definite that the air conditioning was fixed. 

We were charged £25 deposit per room in case of any damages. I don't know if that was just because we were a hen party or if that's a general rule. 

I can't comment on 'value for money' as I didn't book the hotel for the group. I would imagine that for 17 of us, a lot of money was exchanged. 

Overall it was a pleasant stay but especially as we're coming into summer now, the air conditioning really does need addressing.

I did originally find the £10 per day parking charge a little high but as we were able to park there all day and all night, I suppose it's not bad for a city centre. 
We were greeted by friendly staff upon our arrival who gave us advise on the best routes to take based on where we had told them we were planning to go. We were also provided with maps which was handy. 
We were staying on the 4th floor which an elevator takes you to. The room is fairly small but it was plenty big enough for myself and my partner as we only really slept and got ready there, the rest of the time we were bury exploring the wonderful Bristol! The room has everything you could need and the toiletries were plentiful and to a high quality. The shower was amazing once you get the temperature setting right! The iMac was handy however my partner did watch the football on night and didn't think much of the picture quality. The WIFI was easy to connect to and we didn't have any problems with internet connection the whole weekend. There was a small fridge in the room which was great as we had brought food and drink with us for the room. 
The bed was SO COMFY I didn't want to leave it. Soft, squishy pillows and a lovely firm mattress! It took us a day to figure out the air-con but once we did, it worked perfectly and really cooled the room down which was lovely when the window only opened a little as standard in hotel rooms! We didn't have any issues with noise from the traffic but we were at the back of the hotel overlooking the park and not right next to a main road as it is at the front. Room service was great the one day we did have it but I personally find it a little unnecessary to have it every day so we left our Do Not Disturb sign most of the time. 
The hotel is in a great location, about a 10min walk to the city centre which was nice as it meant we weren't right at the heart of all the hustle and bustle! There is a lovely park right opposite the hotel which is next to some very beautiful church ruins. Once you get your bearings in Bristol, it is very easy to get to the city centre, train station and many other local attractions. 
I would stay at this hotel again if i was visiting Bristol and would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to visit for a short break.","0","","2014-06-30","2014-06-17","2014-06-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r210735389-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Good things first:
- excellent location
- reasonable price
- great breakfast
- room service quick with very tasty food.

Not that good:
As the staff are particulary friendly and helpful we found the lady on the check in quite rude (I think she was polish).After breakfast we went to ask if late check out is possible, she answer us "" yeah I need you to charge for that tho"" and didn't even ask for how long we needed to stay.

Apple Mac's are nice perk once is worked, what is not quite case. Mouse and keyboard wasn't working correctly so we used our own. 

As someone previously mentioned the beds are quite hard.For a first time I had really bad sleep at Hilton due to very hard mattress.we woke up more tired as we went to bed.

Air-con  not functioning properly.

The second time was not so good. The wifi didn't work, and I needed it to work in the evening so I was offered to move rooms, I did explain to the receptionist that I had room service coming so id like to eat and then move. She still insisted on coming up and moving me, and at the Same time the food arrived mid move. This meant it was cold by the time I came to eat it. The chicken burger was very chargrilled and didn't taste of anything but charcoal. They did refund my dinner in the morning which was a good gesture. It's a lovely looking and clean hotel (although very small rooms and bathrooms) and it could be lovely but they just seem to be missing something.

One or two problems, wake up calls at 6am Saturday  though I hadnt requested them, and the banging of the doors countless times by the hen party on the same floor but after calming down especially about the early calls and reception initially telling me it would be another guest trying to contact me, until I got the automated voice informing me I had ordered it, but obviously had not, I thought it was a nice hotel, great shower, room a little small if there was 2 sharing for 3 nights but very clean.
Handy little fridge too, and safe, along with the usual Hilton extras.
I had a park view, if you can call it that, but at least you are around the back and not facing the major road at the front.
Restaurant seems popular, 2 AA rosette, didnt try it, breakfast same, but I preferred to walk through that small park to a Subway where breakfast is only £2-£2.30 with a cappucino included.
From the train station it is only a few minutes away if you take the right route, ask where the Wetherspoons is, from there just stay left from the outside area, you will see the hotel as you walk around the corner.
Bristol itself is a great place to visit, lots of great real ale pubs which suits me.
I would stay again here, if I got roughly the same deal of £50 a night (originally booked for 2 but wife couldnt make it) over the weekend.
One final mention, the staff are very pleasant and overall very helpful.","0","","2014-05-31","2014-06-02","2014-06-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r208590149-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The Hilton Honors features you get in other Hiltons are not evident here: free bottled water first night only, daily newspaper either the FT or the iPaper, no real choice.

Very handy for the station and the airport bus stops right outside on the inward route. Not cheap – for a much lower class Hilton - but as I was on Hilton Points it was not a big deal. I was glad not to be paying, though.

Reception was efficient and reception staff all very pleasant. But are these people only to be sourced in eastern Europe these days?

Downside – the breakfast was dire. Dreadful service from quite pleasant and charming young staff – though the room was not even half full. It took ten minutes for the worst cup of coffee in the world to materialise. It was supposed to be a cappuccino but was indescribable; it tasted of diesel… Two poached eggs requested arrived hard and without toast. 

Ghastly piped muzak, of which only the thumping base was audible. Suggestion: if you are staying and need breakfast – go to the Yurt across the road by the station. Half the price and ten times the quality. And the music there is truly cool.","1","","2014-05-31","2014-05-23","2014-05-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r206743116-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Modern and well-equipped rooms with most everything you could want.  Nice range of toiletries and the bathroom was clean, stylish and effective.

Slept well in a room overlooking the park, no issues with aircon and a nice touch if you were staying longer is the fridge is empty if you want to bring your own drink/snacks etc; good idea.  Only used the Apple Mac for television and worked OK - terrified I'd lose the tiny little remote control though!

Only knocked a point off for the car park which is very small, expensive (£10 a day) and a nightmare to get in and out from; I had to reverse the whole length of the car park before attempting to turn around.

Location isn't bad, a little too far out for me but we saw areas of Bristol we'd never seen before, and it really isn't too far to walk into town (10  mins max).  Bottom line is I'd stay again at the same rate.","0","","2014-05-31","2014-05-23","2014-05-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r206738461-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We had just a regular room but we were emailed a week prior to our stay to say we could have upgraded the room for only £10 for the night.

Really enjoyed the stay overall, the hotel had a newly refurbished feel and was clean and modern. 

Car parking wasn't an issue as we got the last 2 spaces, although I had to park on some chevron'y type area which I doubt should be used in ideal circumstances! I'm not sure where we would have parked if the chef hadn't come out to give up his space! 

Staff were friendly and polite, especially the chap who worked in the coffee bar! We had a relaxing few hours sitting in the bar / lounge catching up over drinks which was really enjoyable. 

We caught a cab to harbourside which was only £6-7 although we'll know for next time that the hotel is very well situated to the city centre and I think a 20-30 minute walk would take you pretty much anywhere you needed to go. 

Although my room was 'compact' it had some super features, an iMac with free WiFi, fridge, safe and decent shower. Personally the bed was a little hard for my liking so I didn't have the best night sleep but something like that is very subjective, so shouldn't affect a choice in staying there. 

I also found my room too hot and despite figuring out the air-con and popping it on full, it didn't seem to make a difference. I tried the window but that wouldn't open far enough to create a breeze. 

Breakfast was good. I asked for poached eggs which were cooked to order and were lovely. Speciality coffees could also be requested, and although I didn't have one, the waffles looked and smelt amazing! 

Would definitely return.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/e4/33/2e/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

The bathroom clean and stocked with nice shampoos shower gels and fluffy white towels . Plenty of seating in the room and storage .

Plenty of hen parties there and the receptionist was at pains to point out if we experienced any problems to call reception immediately as there were staff on all night and would deal with any issues immediately . Which as a woman on my own was very comforting . 
The staff were smiling and seemed happy in there work .
Breakfast was ok for £10.95 tinned fruit was a little disappointing but a small gripe really . Staff again always I hand to fill up coffee or tea .. 
Would stay here again as it's in a great location for shops and main harbour side ..

It was only when I insisted that the purpose of a fridge was to keep food and drink cold did she agree to get somebody else to look at fridge. Man came tested fridge and then brought a replacement. Man did not say one word to us. Think he may not have spoken English. Parking at hotel was £10 a night. There were not enough spaces for guests to park.  On second night someone had driven through the barrier into the car park. Barrier was not replaced during our stay.  Breakfast was ok. Was within easy walking distance of Bristol city centre. There was a German Christmas market in town which was very festive. Would stay here again due to good location.","0","","2013-12-31","2014-05-12","2014-05-12","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r205266693-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

While checking in we paid car park £10 and booked breakfast £10.95 each and then was told the price for that would be £35.90, when my husband questioned the price saying it shouldn't be that much the receptionist became sarcastic and started counting out the price to him only to be embarrassed that my husband was right and we was over charged as it should of only £31.90. We had booked a meal deal with the hotel and was told that the restaurant was fully booked so we would have to eat in the bar absolutely fine don't mind doing that. Got to our room which was clean and tidy few stains on the carpet and room is quite small but in all fine. Got ready then went down to dinner only to be told when we got there that restaurant was full and all tables in the bar were booked so we couldn't have dinner there that night so went to reception to speak to them and was told I will find out if you can have dinner in your room with out the service charge, but if we wanted to eat in our room we would of stayed at home so if we couldn't eat there can we have the money back and were go eat else where, then the woman came out of the bar saying she didn't realise that we were residents and thought that we had just turned up there with a voucher for dinner. Dinner it self was nice but small. Next morning went down to breakfast which was very nice after breakfast we went to check out walked up to reception asked to check out and gave the woman our key card then she just stood there staring at me but not talking I asked if every thing was ok and was told yes you can go now asked how we get out of the car park she said oh year your need this then threw a piece of paper on the desk and turned around. 

IN all hotel its self is very nice and food is good but the staff are very stuck up and rude will not be returning to a Hilton hotel again would much rather go to a premier inn or jury inn where the staff are much more helpful and friendly.","1","","2014-05-31","2014-05-11","2014-05-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r205076164-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room we were directed to looked great, classic modern, clean and well equipped. On closer inspection we found one of the lights wasn't working. The response by staff was immediate and very apologetic.  Even though it was quite late, we were moved to another room. Once there, we had to contact management again because the computer was having problems.  This was quickly resolved and we were given complementary drinks. Again, the staff were very polite and helpful.   In the morning the handle on the bathroom door became detached from the door when my husband went to open it.

By now we were wondering whether we would be labelled ""awkward Guests"", but no.  The staff were brilliant.  We were allocated another room for our second night, where we enjoyed a very peaceful, uneventful stay.  

So, many thanks to all involved for your care and consideration during our visit.

The rooms are very small yet modern and clean. All have an IMac yet ours wasn't working in the first room do we were moved to another.... The IMac in that room had an issue of a noise interference which the hotel staff tried to repair whilst we visited the local bars. The issue wasn't repaired so we were therefore given a complimentary breakfast which was well received. 

A negative noticed with this hotel was the small selection of goods sold in the foyer.... A Youngs frozen fish pie £8 as well as £5 Tampax in stock seemed a little extortionate in my opinion. Particularly to charge such high prices for ladies essentials is outrageous- visitors don't forget to take your own necessaries and any microwave meal you may wish for.

Sleep Quality: 1","OK, if you can sleep on a concrete bed!","Probably one of the most uncomfortable beds that we have ever slept on - the Head Office buyer of these beds needs to sample the goods before he / she buys, before subjecting unsuspecting guests to a very unpleasant night, we'd have probably slept better lying on the floor!

We arrived at around 14:15 hrs on a Saturday 26th April, (we knew that check-in was from 15:00 hrs,) mind you it's a good job we did arrive early, since there were just two parking spaces remaining in the car park! We queued at reception for 10 minutes whilst others checked in, to be told, when we arrived at the head of the queue that 'our' room was not yet ready, we were told to go away & come back at 15:00 hrs. Funnily enough the 15 or so people behind us in the queue were subsequently checked in to their rooms without a hitch, why we couldn't have been allocated another room I just don't know? 

At 15:00 hrs we subsequently rejoined a queue, to be told again that our room was still not ready? You can imagine our reaction, apparently the room we'd been allocated had the two singles pushed together & a member of housekeeping staff had yet to get around to separate them! We advised the receptionist that this was exactly what we wanted (we'd requested a twin so that we could indeed push the beds together,) what we didn't want was a 4' 6"" small double bed, which is exactly what you get with a 'double room' apparently.

The room allocated to us, No. 221 front road facing room, had triple glazing, so zero road noise, however the issue we had was a lack of fresh air, whilst there was a small window that opened by few inches the resultant road noise created another problem. The room had an air conditioning unit, which regulated the temperature quite well but using it (as with any air-con unit) while trying to sleep gives you quite a dry throat so this had to be turned off.

In terms of room size it was no larger than a standard 'Premier Inn' hotel room & certainly not much better although around twice the price of a standard 'Premier Inn' at £89.00 / night, the only 'extra you get as part of the deal is an 'Apple imac TV/PC, so all in all not a great stay I'm afraid & especially for the price paid, suggest you go to 'Premier Inn' & 'a guaranteed good nights sleep or your money back' - appears this is not offered by Hilton Garden Inns in the UK, only in their sister hotels in the USA!","0","","2014-04-30","2014-04-28","2014-04-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r203102998-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

This meant it was at the back of the hotel away from the trafic at the front and was supposed to have views over the garden. Turns out that we were charged for a room that had a view of a car-park and the noise of the hotel's own music being played to anybody who happened to be passing out on the street complete with the smell of smokers gathering just below our window in the evening. In the morning you have the noise of delivery vans and refuse lorries. I didn't know I had being charged for an upgrade so just put up with the room as with a city centre location you can't expect the peace and quiet of the coutryside but to only find out at checkout that you had been charged for a ""better"" and ""quieter"" room with a ""view"" came as a bit of a surprise.","0","","2014-04-30","2014-04-24","2014-04-24","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r202656842-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Good points

Good sound proofing - we weren't disturbed by noise from the corridor or neighbouring rooms
Good air conditioning - was easy to keep the room at a comfortable temperature
Fridge in room - handy for keeping a few drinks chilled
Room cleanliness was good

Not so good -

Small and hard bed - why oh why do hotels scrimp on bed size? The bed was double which I find too small for me and my partner to sleep comfortable together.  We also found the bed hard
Parking charge - at £10 a day parking was a bit pricey

Location wise it is about a 10 minute walk to the main shopping areas and bars.","0","","2014-04-30","2014-04-22","2014-04-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r202290949-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We managed to get a good weekend deal with evening meals and breakfasts for both days. We had to pay £10 per night parking but we were made aware of this beforehand so it was not a surprise. The hotel is fairly modern and is in a good location to be. 5-8 mins walk into town through a nice park then over the river and 5 mins walk to train station . The room we had was on the 5th floor, nice room and very clean, no probs with room at all . The evening meal was from a set menu with starter, main and a desert . Very limited choice to be honest but again, this was expected as it is part of the ""package"" we paid for. Very tiny portion of chicken with 4 tiny half potatoes. Not enough to make u feel full up. We did not have the meal the next night as we decided to eat out, lovely Italian just through the park . Breakfast was very nice, buffet style and this was very good. Sausages need cooking more however, I saw 3-4 other people had not are there's either. Very pink in middle. Other than this I can honestly recommend this hotel. Will defo go back to Bristol and when we do, will stay at the Hilton Gardens for sure .

The hotel is conveniently located for Temple Meads Station, which is only about a 5-min walk.  There are frequent trains between Bristol Temple Meads and Bath Spa. My room was modern, clean, and had all the conveniences (coffee, tea making facilities, safe, fridge and love the Neutrogena toiletries). Lucia at reception was always smiley and helpful.  As people have commented, the rooms are indeed on the small side but that didn't really matter to me, as I traveled on my own. They have a small gym which I used a few times during my stay.  I would have preferred a normal tv versus an iMac as it's not really suited for watching tv shows and I never used it as a computer - but this is a minor comment.  I would stay here again.","1","","2014-04-30","2014-04-21","2014-04-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r202139510-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Fab Apple TV and comfy desk chair, I would have been very pleased with this if travelling on business.
The room was boiling though, and the air con just created a dry mouth situation which was worse than the heat. I struggled to sleep on the first night because of this.
I used the hotel gym which was deserted and well equipped, but on day two went running outside rather than the treadmill and found a brilliant route down along the harbour side to the ss Great Britain. Far more scenic than the gym wall :0) 
We ate at Marcos olive branch which was just through the park. One of the best Italian (technically Sardinian!) meals I've ever eaten, with great value and service.
We booked through Hotwire and got our parking free. We arrived early and spaces weren't an issue. Later that evening the car park was rammed.

They were expecting us eat our evening meal at 8pm including the under 10s that were on board, but after some persuading they changed their minds.  We had no menus, they gave us a set meal but the chef spat his dummy out because he had to cook different meals for the 2 children.  We asked what was to eat but we could barely understand them as they weren't English (I have no problem with that) but they spoke quietly and fast.

As this hotel is very near the city centre it is more suited for business trips rather than holidays.

The rooms are on the small side and there isn't a TV in the room, but on the plus side there is a imac (computer) with FREE internet, you can watch TV on the imac but there is only a limited amount of channels.

We found the hotel to be clean and tidy as was our room, except for the curtains, they looked like they had been sprayed with grease or something, they were completely stained.

The beds were clean and comfortable, but not suitable for elderly fragile people, the beds were quite high off the ground I could barely get on it.  If an elderly person fell out of these beds they could possibly break something (I mean bones not furniture).

It is quiet with some parking (fee paying) which should be free for the price you pay to stay.

If it's a Hilton hotel you want to stay in try Hilton Bristol near the M4 and M5.

We had no choice but to stay here as it was part of the package but given the choice I wouldn't stay here again.","1","","2014-04-30","2014-04-18","2014-04-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r201705925-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was at the end of the corridor, so I feel my room my have been bigger than others. It was very spacious and the bathroom has all the facilities. I was delighted to see that there was not a TV, but an iMac in the room, meaning it doubles up as a computer and TV.Took a while to understand how to turn on, and everytime I moved the screen it would turn off which was a bit annoying. But had to hold the button down for a few seconds to turn it on. My toilet took a few attempts to flush, but have to hold it down for a long time. Iron and ironing board is provided in the room which was handy for my business meeting tomorrow. Tea and coffee facilities are handy for the morning. 
Location wise, it is only a few minutes walk from temple meads station, and also a few minutes to my meeting the next morning. It has a perfect location and very easy to find, not complicated at all. Beware it is on the main road though, my room faced onto the dual carriageway, although I was not affected by the noise at all. 
Included in my package was a 3 course dinner and bottle of sparkling wine. The restaurant is quite small, and filled mostly with families on a lazy sunday evening. I had the fishcakes, sea bream and treacle tart. All were very tasty and well presented. I did feel quite rushed as the food came extremely fast, however this would be good if you were feeling very hungry or was in a hurry. but i had my meal in 40 minutes, as the dishes were ready as soon as you finished, I don't know whether this was because the waitresses were in a rush though. 
The bed is extremely conmfortable and I slept well, no noise at all until about 9am, which is great.
Breakfast was varied with both cooked breakfast and continental, as well as this, you could make your own waffles with batter and machine provided, and you could order extras like omlettes, eggs how you like them etc. The sausages were proper sausages and tasted great, the bacon a bit greasy for me but I've had worse. Everything to a high standard.
All in all, I am very impressed with this hotel, considering the price I paid £79 with dinner included for one night, it is very good value for money.","0","","2014-04-30","2014-04-14","2014-04-14","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r201015093-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Breakfast in morning was the disappointment we wereshown to a table that already been allocated to a group of 4 guys , so they ended up squashed on a table for 2.we were told that someone would be around with teas and coffee in end we got ourselves, plus toast was to be done your self after saying that would be brought to table Good selection of hot breakfast food but ran out fast and not quick to replace, the scrambled eggs were powder ones that tasted awfull.so a big inprovement needed here.
Finally carpark, getting out proved difficult as given a piece of paper which in end hubby had to go back inside and a receptionist came to let us out.please review this as very frustrating.
Overall would we stay at this hotel again, No dont think so, we been to the Hilton Gatwick and could not fault them there.so Bristol Gardens up your game???

Hotel was also far to hot throughout, even though each room has it's own thermostatic controls they don't seem to work and we found out in the morning, along with other guests with the same problem, that we should have asked for them to be reset on the main control panel in reception.","1","","2014-04-30","2014-04-06","2014-04-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r200123905-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Our room was pleasant enough, the bed was comfy, and it was certainly clean.  We did have the usual problem of hubby and I both drink tea and not coffee ,and so the tea bags and milk soon vanished after the first cup - and when hubby went down to reception to request more they said they had no milk and sent him back up with some milk in a cup - which was better than nothing but not ideal!

We ate our meal in the hotel restaurant on the first evening we stayed, the service was good, the meal was good, but I thought it was on the pricey side for what it was.  A quick round of drinks at the bar, three pints, a vodka, a glass of wine and a lemonade cost £30 which was an ouch!

Breakfast was nice, I think it was my bad luck that as I went to get food from the buffet it was running out and about to be replaced, and that happened both mornings we were there.  It would be nice if it could be replaced just before it actually ran out . . .

Just across the park behind the hotel was a lovely little old pub that is well worth the stroll across the park.

The hotel is not too far a walk from town and the Harbourside.

The six of us enjoyed it, and would stay there again if we go back to Bristol.  It's a shame there was no recognition that it was a celebration of hubby's birthday - I know they don't have to, but when I stayed at a Hilton around my 50th they left me some celebration chocolate in the room with a Happy Birthday message - it was just a nice gesture that would have been nice if this Hilton had done it too.

To sum it up, comfy bed, decent breakfast, clean, heating that worked, and a great little pub a few minutes walk away.  Yes, this ticked the necessary boxes.","0","","2014-03-31","2014-03-31","2014-03-31","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r199430683-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We had no sleep and given the driving we were doing, this was not appreciated. Bathroom was also very jammed and small.

The receptionists were very friendly and treated people excellently - can only imagine that's because most of the hotel residents are on business trips. It's clearly a business orientated hotel, with everything so crisp and straight edged, as well as Apple Macs in the rooms, but it was perfect for a one night stop in Bristol to go to a friend's engagement do. Excellent value for money with a Dinner special, and food was very good too, although the younger restaurant staff weren't quite as on the ball as the reception, and lit all the candles around us but missed our table, even though we were one of two tables that were occupied. Also, got some sort of rose sparkling wine, not prosecco as issued on menu, however the more mature gentleman serving us quickly turned the service around in here and was both discreet and attentive so we'll forgive that especially as it was such good value. The room was compact but so light and comfortable that it more than made up for it. An excellent nights sleep followed by a very understanding gentleman at reception accepting a morning request for a late check out and breakfast due to the engagement party induced hangover. Skilful staff, excellent location, pleasant decor - made it about ten times more romantic than the supposedly romantic Double Tree Cadbury house. We would return.","1","","2013-11-30","2014-03-22","2014-03-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r198307979-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The staff on check in were really friendly and we could check in early.  The rooms are compact but really well equipped.  There is a safe, fridge, free wifi and an Apple Mac TV.  The TV has Sky Sports which is a real bonus.  The room is really clean and comfortable and is a pleasure to spend time in.

The rate included breakfast which was really top quality and the service staff and really helpful.  We ate in the hotel and the food was top quality.

The parking was convenient and whilst you had to pay it was oly £10 per night.

I would definitely stay here again and it is certainly competitively priced.  Whilst some may say its location on Temple Way maybe a bit busy, the back of the hotel is close to Victoria Street and then on to the centre.","0","","2014-03-31","2014-03-11","2014-03-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r197052592-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I asked to speak with a manager this morning to get it dealt with. The only person on is the receptionist who tells me that they are aware of it! She informed me that it only occurs when it rains!!!? This is the fifth floor of a hotel. This should have been dealt with as soon as it occurred! 
I have asked to speak with the manager but was told he is not in until Monday!
I asked for his phone number - but was given the number of the maintenance man!
This is, without doubt, an appalling service.
What other hotel would leave the continuing strong and foul smell of raw sewage where guests are paying to stay? It is unacceptable and, I am certain, against all health legislation. We were also kept awake by young adults partying up and down the corridor overnight! Wish i could add a 'smellograph'......","1","","2014-03-31","2014-03-09","2014-03-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r196715512-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 4","Good in parts","first time stayed here - agree with comments about parling, (£10 and limited spaces) althouh I subsequently found the public car park 50 yds from the front door that may have an overnight rate (or be free from 1800 - 0800, I'll check it out next time).

Room - good, reasonable size with comfortable pillows and bed.   Clean and a sensible temperature!  TV is actually a Mac computer - ok if you know these things but it took me ages to find the on button (on the back of the monitor - low down on left) and then there was no sound.  Reception made a few comments in poor English before saying they would send someone up - nothing happened, 20 mins later I tried again and got an English speaking girl who advised me to check the back of the machine and see if there was anything plugged into the headphone socket - there was!  pulling that out gave me sound but I then found a Sub woofer and stereo speakers which presumably were the items that had been plugged in but didn't work.   I should not have to play with wiring !  This machine acts as your TV and as a computer with free internet access.

Around 1830, I was very (I mean very) aware of a high pitvched drone and was about to ask to move rooms but when I walked down the corridor it was evident at one end of both the 1st and 2nd floors but not the 3rd.   That said, as I was about to re-pack the bag, the noise stopped and luckily nevr came back!

During this ""walkabout"" I noticed that the fire escape at one end of 1st floor was partly blocked by a cart and the refuge area on the stairs was blocked with boxes.  When I went for dinner, I checked again and the cart had gone.  I reported the boxes to the receptionist but an hour later they were still there!

I eat in the restaurant - staff were a bit lacking on arrival but were very apologetic when I found them and remained attentive thereafter so totally forgiven.  Food was suprisingly good and menu was sensibly sized - ie. not too many items on it although for Shrove Tuesday pancakes were sadly lacking.  That said the table next to me had abviously asked for pancakes and these were cooked and delivered so again - a bonus point for service.  Overall I was impressed by quality of food although price a little on the high side.  Breakfast was also good although fired eggs being cooked to order slowed things down a bit (minor point)

Overall - some good points, one or two bad ones 

Will I stay again - yes I probably will!","0","","2014-03-31","2014-03-05","2014-03-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r196350968-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We were required to make a £50 room deposit, I don't mind this but the promise that it would be refunded in the morning was false (three days). On arrival in the room there was no electicity (no tea/coffee, no hairdryer, no TV/iMac). Air conditioning was noisy but when turned off it was possible to hear what sounded like people urinating in surrounding rooms and turned itself back on after a while. Cooked breakfast was cold and there were no newspapers in the racks. The 24 hour convenience mart mentioned on the web site is tacky vending machines. I was also decidely unhappy with the removal of tables and chairs whilst still eating breakfast, gives one an unwelcome feeling.
  I will say the room was clean with a nice bathroom, although the piece of extruded plastic which I suspect was supposed to be a soap dish was decidely low rent and shouldn't a four star hotel provide bathrobes? The insulation from traffic noise was good. The staff were polite and efficient.
  There is a satisfaction guarantee, if you are not satisfied you don't pay, as our stay was part of a deal and so paid for in advance I requested a refund, this was not forthcoming and I haven't received any contact in this regard.","0","","2014-02-28","2014-02-28","2014-02-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r195659258-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Thought we'd booked a decent sized room overlooking Temple Gardens.  Excellent check in/welcome.  We got the view (5th floor, v nice) but room was not large at all.  A double bed, desk chair and other chair filled the room and we had to move the chairs to get into the wardrobe. Liked the Apple Mac in the room, tea/coffee (no biscuits - husband sad) and no mini bar.  Not sure why.   You had to wander down to reception to buy bar items with which you could stock your fridge.  Might as well pop to the minimart round the corner.

So the room was not dissimilar to a Premier Inn/Holiday Inn Express; just a bit more pricey.

Car parking space hit and miss.  We had the last space.  Prob is that the barriers do not stop people entering the car park even when it's full so cars tend to park wherever they can and so potentially block others.

Gym small but perfectly functioning.  Free headphones which was a nice touch.

Breakfast was fine. Good selection of fresh fruit, pastries and hot food.  Bit annoying that once you had one hot drink you had to track down a waiter/waitress to get a refill.  We helped ourselves once and were told off.  Asked for an omelette one morning, chef looked annoyed, and we had to chase.  It was rubbery when it arrived but edible.  Shame - with just a bit more attention with hot drink top ups, and a smile or two from the chef, this could have been better.","0","","2014-02-28","2014-02-20","2014-02-20","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r194759001-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It has been a pleasant overnight stay. The room is comfortable and well equipped. Apple computer/TV in the room, a reasonable sized fridge, a good shower and an iron and a hair dryer, which keeps my wife happy.
The breakfast was very good. Plenty of choice and the cooked breakfast was well cooked and fresh. Even included a waffle maker and batter for you make your own waffles.

Staff were friendly and helpful. However the car parking was abysmal. On arrival there was a sign stating the car park for the hotel was full. The option given was a dark unlit pay and display car park down the road. After some persuasion a space was found for my car within the hotel car park but due to worrying that if I used my car I wouldnt be guaranteed a space we decided to rely on taxis. Due to this I wouldnt recommend this hotel unless you are visiting Bristol on the train.","2","","2014-02-28","2014-02-15","2014-02-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r194202158-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was rather small, but still comfy and very quiet. There was a good sized wardrobe to store clothes if staying longer than a night and the chair with the desk was a great higher-end one for business people! The bed was perfect for us in terms of hardness, had a great sleep, it was a bit too high though.
The iMac was a great addition to have, however, probably not the best choice instead of a TV as it's a bit small and not the easiest to navigate from bed.
The room and the bathroom were clean and beside a couple of marks the interior didn't look worn out. The toilet wasn't spotless under the seat though..
Breakfast was a nice buffet style one (we found it better in quality and selection than the 'inn' ones), the English breakfast items were freshly prepared and filled up regularly, great range of continental items (loads of cereals, yoghurts, dired fruits..etc) and a waffle maker!! 
Staff were very helpful and polite.
There was one thing which we could not fully understand though...check out time was 12, we finished breakfast around 11.50 and wanted to go back to the room to pick our bags up and the card was already 'disconnected' from the room...? 
Overall enjoyed it and will consider booking it again.","1","","2014-02-28","2014-02-09","2014-02-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r193597336-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is clean, quiet and the wifi works in the rooms. One strange aspect of the room is the Mac desktop acts as the TV. This sounds cool but once I was given the remote (it was missing) the TV/Mac was not easy to navigate. 

As mentioned in the title, the breakfast was pretty awful. The (spartan) staff were dispirited young eastern Europeans who obviously hadn't worked there very long. I had to drink my OJ out of a coffee mug and waited at the breakfast bar for ages while another customer was complaining.

Check in was polite and efficient.

The hotel is clean and tidy and fairly new.

The room was excellent. the quality and finish are better than I expected.

The ensuite shower was also very good. powerful hot water with the usual Hilton quality.

There was hardly any noise from other residents and the bed was very confortable.

The apple computer provides the TV service.

The wi-fi signal strength was excellent in the room but the speed was poor, only achieving 1.93Mbps download and 1.07Mbps upload, which wasn't sufficient for me to be able to work on my laptop. Reception advised that the system had been recently upgraded when I advised them of the issue.

Breakfast was basic and not worth the money. tehre were the usual cereals, fruit etc bu the hot food was in metal skillets with glass lids. This meant that the condensation remainined in the skillet and mad everything soggy. next time I won't book the breakfast.","1","","2014-01-31","2014-01-27","2014-01-27","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r192218019-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The reception staff were really helpful and friendly, always a good start.

The room was immaculate, everything seemed brand new and the Apple mac tv was a bonus.

Shower room was light and airy and also very clean.

My only shock was the cost of a glass of wine and a hot chocolate at the bar.  £13!! Will not get caught out again but on the positive side the bar staff went to town on my hot chocolate, it arrived with a strawberry in it!

Breakfast was hot, fresh and everything was there you could want.  Drinks were available to take away if you were in a rush.

I arrived at 4pm and parked until 5pm the following day and was charged £10 which I think is good value. (made up fo rthe cost of drinks at the bar!!)

The advantage is that they have a car park where they were happy for me to leave my car whilst I worked in Bristol and collect it at the end of the day.

I ate in the restaurant which was perfectly OK (I wasn't paying) but the execution of the slightly ambitious dishes did not quite come off.  A simpler menu might be better but at least it was very convenient.

The other advantages are that it is not far from the main station if you are walking and I was able to walk to Queen Square in about 10 minutes which was very handy.","2","","2013-12-31","2014-01-23","2014-01-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r191844400-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I was upgraded to a 'park view' room for a reduced charge and have to say it was preferable to viewing the road! Excellent location for visiting Bristol centre or other attractions and easy to find. In fact, a very pleasant walk into town in less than 10 minutes.  Wifi was the fastest I've encountered in any hotel and the sleek iMac computer/TV was a nice touch. All-in-all it compared very favourably with an 'apartment hotel', which I usually use in other locations. Room safe and refrigerator provided, ironing equipment in room, wardrobe (with a mirrored door) and drawers and plenty of other storage space. The general standard of furnishing was very high and everything was comfortable.  Charge for parking on the hotel site a little excessive for someone staying more than one day, but it is in the City centre and there was always plenty of room.  Overall an enjoyable experience and definitely a place I would stay at again.","1","","2014-01-31","2014-01-08","2014-01-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r190233995-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I'd not hesitate to stay here again if the need arises.
Stayed on the top floor and it was silent! (NYE)
Everything worked, it was clean, what more could you ask for.
iMac was handy - we even used it to order late night food in!

The only real downside was the parking, massive let down.
Admittedly we arrived late to the hotel (9ish) but there's nothing worse than arriving at your destination then having to go and search for parking. Again I know it's a central location but somehow this should be resolved... I really didn't appreciate having to get up for 8am to run down and pay for parking either.

At checkout I heard a couple of people grumble and go through the satisfaction guarantee, what rubbish. I'd like to pass on my curtsey to the good job that reception did - unfortunately I understand that somethings, namely parking are simply out of their control. I do however hope that management read this and do something about the abysmal parking situation - far too few spaces relative to hotel size... this is a hilton!","1","","2014-01-31","2014-01-01","2014-01-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r189244503-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It is a well lit up and very modern looking hotel and gives a great impression on arrival unlike some of the other hotels in Bristol which can look quite drab from the outside. We checked in very quickly and the friendly chap behind the counter explained all about our room and the fact we had an iMac which was also our TV/DVD player and computer which is something I haven't experienced in a hotel before!

The room was absolutely lovely, very bright, modern and comfortable. The iMac was brilliant for watching TV to using the free internet to look up things to do and places to go that particular evening. There was also free WIFI but as we were on the very top floor it was incredibly slow (I didn't drop a rating for this because of the free iMac internet and also the WIFI is totally free)

The beds were very comfortable and you had Neutrogena free toiletries in the bathroom including mouthwash, shower gel, shampoo/conditioner, moisturiser etc. The shower was hot and had high pressure what more can you want?

The hotel also has a spa/gym but we didn't get an opportunity to use this, will try it next time!

The breakfast was very nice with a good selection - I personally recommend the waffle which they made fresh for you which is shaped like the logo of the hotel which is a nice touch!

There is a bus stop immediately outside which goes right into the City centre every 10 minutes or so, and is only £1 for a 3 stop to just outside Broadmead (It is walking distance but the weather was terrible)

The Car Park is £10 but they let you keep the car there for a little while after you check out the following day which is a nice touch and there is additional parking down the road, although we saw people who had parked there for free overnight obviously forget to buy parking and they had tickets - so word of warning

Will stay again - Thank you","2","","2013-12-31","2014-01-01","2014-01-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r189197252-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was very clean (spotless) and contained an Apple iMac which doubles up as your TV. We were at the rear side of the hotel and the room was very quiet. Room facilities were excellent and also included a fridge and ironing board. 

The buffet breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice. All the staff were extremely polite, friendly and helpful. The hotel was the cleanest that we'd ever stayed at.

City bus stops in front of hotel, Temple Mead train station is just a short walk away, and the National Express station is about 5 BGP by taxi.  Rooms are clean and quiet, though more compact that Garden Inns in America.

My wife and I set up base camp in Bristol to explore the area as tourists in late October.  Perfect!  More to see and do than can be described here.  And the people we met were those you'd be proud to introduce to anyone!

A special mention concerning the Garden Inn staff at this location:  Gracious, exceptionally helpful -- and honest!  My wife left some rather valuable jewelry in the room when we checked out.  Didn't notice the missing item until we had returned to America.  A phone call to to Sazilvia Dani at the hotel produced more than a little relief.  The jewelry had been located and was on deposit in the hotel safe, awaiting reclamation.  No small task in repatriating it to America, but Szilvia's persistence has been very much appreciated.  Stay here and you'll have no regrets.","0","","2013-10-31","2013-12-09","2013-12-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r187214797-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 5","Excellent stay","Booked this hotel for a night away for my friends 40th birthday as we wanted to be near to Bristol.  Drove and arrived around midday.  I knew that the car park was first come first served and we were lucky enough to get a space.
I imagine that if you arrive later you probably won't get one, (that isnt really the hotels fault though!) although there is another pay and display across the road at the back.  We left the car there until Sunday afternoon and paid £10.00 parking fee which I didnt think was that bad, as there are not many hotels near the centre with parking.
Check in was smooth and friendly and it was good that we could check in early.
Our room was a twin at the back (I had requested a quiet room as the ones at the front face the main road and may have experienced noise from traffic).
The room was perfect, very clean, a Mac which doubled as a PC and TV, it had a couple of music channels which was good when we were getting ready!  The bathroom was lovely, spacious, clean, nice powerful shower, heated mirror, soft towels and lots of goodies (bath/shower gel/shampoo etc).
The lady on reception was very helpful with directing us.
Cabot Circus (main shopping centre) and the Christmas German Markets were about a 10 min walk.  Also visited St Nicholas Market, which is good and lots of bars/restaurants and quirky stalls ....again, about 15 min walk (or 5 mins in a taxi on the evening).
Had a good night sleep, beds were very comfortable.
Breakfast was buffet style and there was a lovely selection - hot or cold and also things to order too.  Very tasty.
Check out was fine and friendly.
Overall, it was a great stay and very convenient - Train Station (Temple Meads) was a 10 min walk and we caught the train to Bath (well worth doing that!).  If you need something to eat and cannot be bothered to go into the centre there is a Wetherspoons about 5 mins away by the Train Station (Temple Quay) which is handy.","0","","2013-12-31","2013-12-09","2013-12-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r187156146-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Car parking awful, let the hotel down completely. Small tight car park which is a dead end, entered through barrier, drove down 45 spaces (or so they claim, appears smaller) to find it full, you can then only reverse out as no space to turn, then find yourself at the barrier again which you could only get through using a ticket from reception, meaning you have to leave your car blocking traffic to go into the hotel to get let out. Stupid. 

On the plus side, meeting room and facilities good, toilets clean and well managed and food was AMAZING. Restaurant staff helpful, although our allocated 30 min lunch break took double that. Receptionist also helpful.

I would return just for more of the high quality food, but get the train as Temple Meads is only a 5 minute walk.

We saw an offer for an overnight stay with 3 course meal and wine and decided to stay here for a change.

Firstly it was easy to find near temple meads station, as we arrived later on Saturday PM the car park was full however parking on the road was free after 6pm and for Sunday so we did that instead saving a few quid.  Check in was quick, and we prebooked a table for dinner. Pleasant clean and adequately sized room with a park view therefore quiet. Very comfortable bed and good range of toiletries. Free wifi too.

Dinner was very good, and service was excellent.

After dinner we were going to head off into town for drinks but instead wandered over the road where there is a basic but pleasant enough wetherspoons pub which was fine for a few drinks.

Would I stay again? Yes, however for us the mercure is a better location.  We felt this was a little too far for the places we like to visit and therefore it would not be top of our list. The main shopping area however is walkable, as is the harbour side, albeit harbourside was a fair trek.  

Overall though, absolutely can't fault the hotel and staff.","0","","2013-11-30","2013-12-05","2013-12-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r186847802-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The receptionist Saturday evening was  off hand and flippant when we remarked on the lack of hot water For a shower that morning .The duty receptionist Sunday  more than made up for this by his pleasant and helpful demeanour and offer of a complimentary snack together with an  explanation of the buses and looking  after our bags for us.

I was delighted to find that the window of our room opened a little, so the air con was not needed and we slept extremely well. The room was at the back and overlooked a park, so was very quiet: worth asking for a room at the back, then! (But some rooms are above the outdoor smokers' area, so beware the faint drift of smoke!) 

Another interesting experience: I was about to book a room online for £79 but when I realised this would not include breakfast, I decided to phone and check the cost of breakfast. The person at the Hilton call centre obviously picked up on the scepticism in my voice and immediately said she could offer the same price but breakfast included. Then she said she had another special offer of £89 which would include the 2 breakfasts and 2 two-course evening meals. Which I went for! And the food (veggie) was certainly above average. And only a 15-minute walk from the city centre and riverside.","1","","2013-11-30","2013-11-22","2013-11-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r185474024-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Never tried this one before. At short notice, they had the best rates in town, so gave it a try. 

The hotel is easy to find on the outskirts of Central Bristol. The car park is small, and charges £10 per 24 hours. Get there early to secure a space. The hotel is a short walk from the harbourside area, and 10 minutes on foot from Broadmead and Cabot Circus shopping. We managed to get checked in at 1030, which was excellent.

We went for a standard double room, which felt quite small, particularly the bathroom. The first room allocated was right next to the lifts and they creaked and clanked through the wall, so a new one was requested and sorted immediately. The bed was comfy but creaked. Facilities standard - tea, coffee, toiletries and a fridge.

We found it difficult to get the temperature right during the night, but otherwise spent a quiet time on the third floor, with very little noise from communal areas - this is unusual for a Bristol hotel on a Saturday night!

We didn't use the restaurant or bar except for breakfast, which came with our room rate. Breakfast was very good, as long as you don't pay the full price. A good selection of items, nicely cooked and presented. Staff a little stressed.

The decor felt a little tired, it's not the best location in town, the car park is pokey but all in all, it was pretty decent and we would consider going again if the price was right.","1","","2013-11-30","2013-11-17","2013-11-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r185000477-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

When we arrived in the restaurant, they gave us a menu and then promptly took this away and gave us the package menu. With very little choice and the food was below average, stodgy and microwaved, my husband most of the time in the bathroom with an upset stomach.  The following night we had to go to a concert early and the restaurant wasn't open. To be fair to the bar staff, we were allowed to eat in the bar earlier. However, when they produced the menu, it was exactly the same as the previous night. We said that we didn't want to eat from this and they bent over backwards to make us happy by letting us choose from the bar menu which was heaps better.","0","","2013-11-30","2013-11-15","2013-11-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r184842898-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

On entering the hotel was clean, décor was modern and reception was pleasant and very helpful.
The room was well laid out and had all the amenities that we required, including an Apple computer setup with TV facilities.  The only factor that stop us giving a 5 rating was the shower was unpredictable and one minute the water would be at an ample temperature, then suddenly go cold and then hot.
We ate at the hotel’s restaurant and on entering the reception we was greeted by a member of staff asking if we would like a complimentary pumpkin drink. 

The food in the restaurant was very good, although had to explain a couple of times prior to eating that we were on a promotion to (who we think was the Restaurant Manager) and what that included.

The hotel is a five minute walk from the station.  There is a bus stop outside the hotel, which we took to the suspension bridge and walked back the hotel via parks, museums, cathedral, and art exhibitions (mostly down hill walking).
Overall a very good experience, great value and would recommend.","0","","2013-10-31","2013-11-10","2013-11-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r184217526-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Check in was a breeze. I asked for a room on an upper floor (just because upper floors are generally quieter) and was accommodated. My room looked towards the back of the hotel , and was very quiet. 

The Daily breakfast has a great variety and should suit anyones needs. They offer a range of cold cereals, fruit, mead, cheese, breads, croissants, muffins, eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, tomatoes, yogurt and the self-serve waffle machine. You can also have eggs cooked to preference. I had an omelette and the only minor complaint I could make was that they didn't have any options of vegetable to put in it. I'm from Canada and am used to omelettes full of vegetables (peppers, onion, spinach, etc..), I ended up with ham, mushroom & cheese - a very minor inconvenience.

The room was very clean and modern. It featured an iMac in pace of a regular TV which you could use to watch TV, surf the net, or whatever else a mac can do. There was also free wifi throughout the hotel and the reception in my room was fine to video chat back home. The room also had a mini fridge (empty) and a small safe. The shower was hot and water pressure ample.

The hotel also has a small but adequate gym that has a few treadmills, cycles, do-it-all machine and some free-weights. Just fine to stay in shape while on the road. I did not find (mind you I didn't ask either) a pool/steam-room or sauna on site. 

Check out was also very simple. Standard checkout time is 12:00pm, I requested a late checkout and was offered 1:00pm. Not a huge difference so I checked out and made use of temporary bag storage while checking out the city a bit on the last day.

There are plenty of amenities well within waling distance of the hotel. Bristol city centre is <10min walk where you can find many restaurants,pubs, etc..

All in all, I have no complaints and would both recommend this hotel and stay there again.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/cb/ae/1e/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

Plans changed and we ended up driving to the hotel- it was easy to find but the car-park was full and so we used a privately owned car-park just down the road. 
The room was very clean and tidy, not the biggest hotel room I've ever been in, but it felt cosy rather than small. 
The iMac/tv was a nice idea, however when we first loaded it up, we were met with a screen full of hardcore pornography. We initially found this hilarious, but not so much when we considered what the previous occupants may have been up to...
We had dinner in the restaurant which was all delicious. The service was very good also.

Location suited our needs. Car park on site, made big difference when staying in a busy city. Nice walk along the river side with plenty of bars, cafe's plenty to see on route.

Comfortable, stylish and quiet rooms, friendly staff, good restaurant but limited choices on dinner menu. Good breakfast. Overall very enjoyable and good value.

Breakfast was good, Sunday was a bit manic with the usual rush as everyone seemed to enjoy the extra hour with clocks going back but staff coped well, no running out of food. All staff were helpful and location is great if using the train plus just a short walk into city centre. Very quiet as well for a weekend in terms of noise both inside and outside hotel. 

Would definitely stay here again as hotel has maintained good standards over last couple of years and normally good deals to be had with Hilton.","0","","2013-10-31","2013-10-28","2013-10-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r182738524-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The bed was comfortable and there was an alarm clock next to the bed. The air-conditioning was loud but. The bathroom was a decent size although the shower door leaked. Breakfast was included in our tariff and was good. Fried eggs and waffles were cooked freshly by a very friendly lady. There was plenty of bacon, sausages etc.

Dinner was excellent but watch out for having to pay extra for sides like bowls of chips, ie. things you'd normally expect to be included in your meal. Very attentive restaurant staff, shame the receptionist was not as good. She was a bit frosty, especially when we arrived early, but she did let us check in. This hotel is perfectly located across the road from Temple Quays and Temple Meads station just a short walk away. The car park is tight, needed a 20 point turn to get out, wouldn't like to get a large 4 wheel drive round it!

The room was spotless, lovely firm mattress and clean bathroom with a nice strong walk-in shower. The room was a bit small but still pretty comfortable. Our room was on the fourth floor as far away from the elevator as possible, so it was quiet enough to enjoy a peaceful night's sleep.

As we stayed on a Friday night we managed to get a seasonal special that included a two course dinner and buffet breakfast for only £110. My wife chose a starter and main, while I went for a desert and main. The food was well presented and very tasty, even though the portions may have been somewhat on the small side. The buffet breakfast was without any fault.

The parking is a bit tight and I guess it could be a problem during the week, but as this was a Friday night and we arrived at 18:00, we had no problem in finding a parking spot in the smallish hotel car park. Take note that there is an additional £10 charge per day to use this car park.

All in all a satisfactory stay that could not be faulted in any way.

The room was clean, bed was firm but ok but the bathroom was too cramped. Imac was ok once we had sort it out but the lack of wifi was annoying. Although the view at the back was obliterated by huge trees it  was better than the noisier front on the road.
Location is good just ten minutes from the main centre.
We had breakfast  both days and compared to the last Hilton it was disappointing although we can't comment on the hot food the choice of fresh bread was poor and you clashed with the people waiting at the toaster. One thing we always enjoyed was the fresh cut fruit but here cheap tasteless tinned Pineapple isn't good enough.
The staff were excellent particularly in giving directions.

There are a couple of draw backs... the rooms are not huge, but are very pleasant and clean. Also, you get an imac in each room which is a great idea, but you do need a 'proper' tv after the novelty wears off!

I really like this hotel, but it caters more to the weekend visitor than it does to a business traveler.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-10-02","2013-10-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r179483288-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The bar man was friendly and drink prices very reasonable for a hotel. 

Located just a few minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads station and 5 minutes from the city centre. 

I've stayed at the hotel a number of times and it has always remained at a consistently high standard. The only downside is the small car park, although I understand that alternative parking is nearby.

Checking in was efficient, staff were very helpful giving us a map to restaurant we were booked into. Bar staff were excellent, agreeing to open up when we arrived late and serve a couple of rounds of drinks. 
Room was comfortable, bed was good and allowed a good nights sleep. But not convinced by use of Apple desktop as a TV as it was small and clumsy to use.

The check in was faultless and the room was brilliant with all of the mod cons you could wish for including FREE WIFI throughout ( other hotels when will you stop charging ). each room had its own Mac PC as well as speakers and cables. The bathroom was immaculate and bed very comfy.
All of the staff were extremely helpful and downstairs by the bar a fridge full of snacks and frozen meals you could help your self to (for a small charge).

The staff were the right mix of friendly and professional, a special mention to the two night reception staff, one called (Polish spelt) Peter and his British collegue who was very kind and helpful when we had a problem in the night.  The breakfast was excellent, a wide selection and was available all morning.  We had a room over looking the church ruins, for a Saturday night (with the window open) it seemed quiet.  The bed was very comfortable, duvet just the right weight and pillows so comfy I took a picture on my phone of the label so I could search and buy one of my own.  I did not use the bar or other facilities so could not comment.  My only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars was lack of parking spaces but solved this by some of our party parked a little way up the road paid £1 from late afternoon till 6pm then it was free overnight.  Many thanks again to all the hard working staff for making our stay a pleasure.","0","","2013-09-30","2013-09-29","2013-09-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r179106842-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Great location if arriving by train, short 10-15 minute walk to the marina/tourist area. Now why they only get ****, the rooms utilize iMac computers as the TV set (former Mint Hotel left-over), made watching TV difficult unless you sit two-feet from the screen. Especially difficult during sporting events such as tennis (Australian open). If they switch out to a full-size TV, they become five-star for the category of hotel they occupy.

We were told it was 'just closing' but we could have bar snacks. Went to the bar, saw the restaurant doors were open and we asked about dinner. The staff said they weren't closing for orders until half past nine! Strange.
With this exception, everything else was good. The hotel has an intimate warm vibe. Very friendly and courteous bar and restaurant staff. The girl at the bar mixed Bacardi and diet coke just as I like it; with lots of ice and lemon and right to the top of a tall glass. Perfect!
Rooms were clean bright and modern, mac in the room a great bonus. Bed rather small but very comfortable.  Missed having a bath and prefer one but the shower was fine, good pressure and very hot water. Excellent location, Many restaurants and bars very close, including Pizza Express and Costa. Close to shops and harbourside, cathedral near too,

2nd night got great service but had a hair in my pepper sauce. Sorted personally by the head chef and again complementary meal. 
Breakfast is lovely, but they advertise that it starts at 6 but I never managed to get any hot food before 620. As it was not out. Also on the last day sat in the restaurant on my own for 20mind before I even saw a waiter.

Being a computer geek I think having a Mac in the room is a nice touch - although as a tv it's a little small.

The rooms are well provisioned and have everything we could need.

It seems there was a stag do at the hotel when we were staying there - but it was still nice and quiet and we got a good nights sleep.

The breakfasts are quite pricey - and don't have the best selection for vegetarians who like a cooked breakfast (adding hash browns would make a big difference) - however for me the waffle maker makes up for it.

There was a special offer on which included dinner bed and breakfast (for less than many of the other 4stars offered b&b only) The room was very plain in style, but the furnishings (iMac, white glass table tops etc) meant it didn't feel cheap. It had the feel of a spa, which made for a very relaxing room! The iMac was a great touch letting us use the Internet without messing about with wifi. More rooms should have it! 
Staff were friendly and flexible, not too officious! 
We at in the bar, food was typical pub type food, well cooked with little twists, but lots of deep fried starters. Breakfast was as good as I've ever had, and served til midday on weekend (a pleasant touch). Now the only real negative: parking, the hotel has a limited car park, it was full when we arrived but we ended up squeezing into a 'gap', which the staff reassured us would be ok as long as we didn't block anyone else. So we got lucky! If we hadn't found this gap, we would have had to park in the pay and display down the road! That has a 4hr max stay on it! Overnight (6pm -8pm) is free BUT: the sign says overnight is for permit holders only, a theory I didn't want to test! And I didn't want I have to get up and 8 to get a ticket! And then have to move the car in 4 hours! Maybe ok for the business traveller but not if your staying the weekend! As I say, we got lucky and on that basis fully recommend the place! A day trip to bath on the train was a highlight for us!

The hotel on first sight may seem a little out of the way, located on a ring road.

The price, though, seems a tad bit higher than other hotels in its class,  probably because of the Hilton brand. That said, the slightly premium side can be seen in the comfort of the rooms with good bedding, nice furnishings and quality toiletries. 

The hotel is nicely located about 5 minutes walk to Bristol Temple Meads railway station. Not too far from the life as well, being 10 to 15 minutes walk to Cabot Circus, St Nicholas Market, and the Harbour area. 

All in all, a more than satisfactory stay. A bit pricey for a budget hotel but worth it if you can get a room on discount.

We arrived at 10.30 am and were happy to be able to park easily and a lovely receptionist was able to check us in.
I had e mailed before hand and had asked for a high floor quiet room and that was exactly what we got. 5th floor and the room was on the front of the hotel but heard no noise at all and I am a very light sleeper. 
The room was lovely. Very bright and smartly done. It was quite small but that didn't bother us .A nice I mac in the room which was a tv too with good channels.
The bathroom was small but nice and clean with a good shower.
The room had a safe and a fridge but the fridge was throwing out warm heat. We didn't realise this until we came back late at night so didn't bother mentioning it. There is free wifi.
When we returned that evening the hotel had left us a card and a bottle of wine for our anniversary which was such a lovely touch and that goes a long way. Little things like that can really make a difference for people celebrating a special event.
There is a small gym which has some good equipment. 
The breakfast experience for us wasn't one of the best. Although we did go down probably the busiest time. 9.30 on the sunday. Breakfast is served till 12. The dining room was full so we sat in the bar area. That was ok though. I felt where the food is laid out is a little congested. Not very pleasant for the people sat near the buffet as people are squeezing past. There was queuing for the eggs and we gave up on that as our other food was going cold. The food could have been hotter. Also we do prefer to be given a coffee pot so you can pour it when you want it.
The quality was good though. Maybe just avoid the busy times at breakfast and the experience will be more pleasant.
This is a lovely modern hotel and in a good position for the harbour side and only 10 minutes to town. Parking might be a problem depending on what time you arrive.
Overall this is a good hotel and would definitely stay again.","0","","2013-09-30","2013-09-08","2013-09-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r176311615-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Slept very well thanks to the big comfy bed and there was very little noise as we were at the back looking over the small park. The hotel was perfectly situated as a base for us to do everything we wanted in the city. 

Only thing to mention is that it might be worth trying to arrange some parking beforehand as the hotel parking is limited and expensive. We pre-booked a space just next to Temple Meads car park which was inexpensive and just a five minute walk away.

The rooms and facilities were great, excellent location for the train station, but a bit further walk to the harbour, which would be my only minor issue, but that really is the only negative thing I could say.

Sleep Quality: 5","Standard hotel made special by great staff","Hotel was modern, clean and well located for the centre with a very comfortable bed.   The Mac in the room is a good idea but the rooms were very cramped as has been mentioned in other reviews and the bathrooms were really tiny.  It was quiet during the night as we had a park view room although I imagine the busy road at the front would be a problem for front facing rooms.  The hotel staff overall were pretty good but the staff in the restaurant at breakfast were exceptional, always friendly, smiling and helpful and so hard working as it was always busy.  We stayed there for a week in August so saw them every morning and they started our day off brilliantly, the management should be aware of the absolute treasures they have employed there.  The breakfast itself was very good and it was also possible to have eggs and waffles and things cooked to order.   Another good thing is the small fridge in the room instead of the ubiquitous and usually over-priced mini-bar, so it was possible to have cold drinks or fruit, etc which is welcome when staying any length of time in a hotel room.  We didn't need parking but the car park seemed quite small although a pay and display was nearby, however there is a bus stop right outside which is very handy for local buses which run to the main areas for visitors.  We were able to take one to visit the Clifton Suspension Bridge which was so convenient and the round trip ticket was very reasonable, although it was a really easy walk to the centre, restaurants, the floating harbour, etc.  Thank you again to the staff in the restaurant.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-09-05","2013-09-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r175899465-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 5","Quality hotel, good location, excellent service","Stayed here for two nights in September 2013.

What I liked :
- Room. My fifth floor Queen Evolution room was not large, but beautifully fitted out and the large window with a park and city view made it seem larger. Lots of natural light but also excellent curtains to darken the room for sleeping. Comfortable bed, storage space, tea and coffee, work desk, everything you would expect from a Hilton. Nice bathroom, strong hot shower, nice toiletries.
- Internet. There is a large iMac desktop computer in the room which also is the TV and music player. it comes with a desktop sound system as well. This is a great addition to the amenities provided and is in keeping with the modern and fresh feeling of the hotel. Usage is free. There is also free wi-fi available if you have your own laptop. It was a little unreliable  in my room but it didn't really matter because of the iMac.
- Service. This was uniformally excellent. Annie in particular on reception was excellent, but everyone was professional, friendly and gave the feeling of a good hotel. Printing, scanning and emailing of documents was easily and efficiently handled by reception.
- Location. Five minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads station and 10 mins easy walk into the centre of Bristol. 
- Breakfast. Without being exceptional it was good. Buffet style, plenty of variety and the restaurant looks out to the street and a lovely park.
- Fitness room. Small but very modern and spotless with cardio, free weights and a mulit-use cross-over machine. 
- General ambience and attention to detail. This hotel feels new and modern. Everything is spotlessly clean and feels fresh. Nice quality fittings, linen and furnishings. 

This is an excellent choice for a stay in Bristol. Not right in the centre, but an easy short walk and if you're arriving by train, it's very close to Temple Meads. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended.","1","","2013-09-30","2013-09-05","2013-09-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r175848867-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Everything about this newish hotel seemed very nice. It's clean, has nice facilities. Each room has an iMac, and the breakfast is great. BUT everything is tiny!!!
The rooms are tiny. The bathrooms are just plain uncomfortable. The restaurant doesn't have enough space to walk around the tables if there are more than two people stood up at any time. 
Here's a tip for you if you're going to install red hot halogen bulbs everywhere... Make your ceilings higher!!! Ok I am very tall, but most places I went, I felt like my hair was on fire! The lifts and the bathrooms are particularly bad. 
I expected this to be similar to garden inns in North America. What I actually got was something half the size. 
Oh and you can't walk around your room because the only floors pace left is taken up by a large rotating chair.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/7b/a6/ba/not-even-enough-room.jpg

The hotel was excellent, especially considering what we paid for B&B. Very close to Temple Meads station, only a few minutes walk, one of the reasons for selecting this hotel as we did not arrive until 11.30pm. Nice clean and modern room, decent size shower cubicle and good quality soap and shower gel etc. We had a very quiet room at the back, overlooking a small park. The choice and quality at breakfast was very good indeed, cold meats, pastries, choice of breads, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurts and all the usual cooked items (including eggs fried to order and proper good quality sausages). Also, something I have never seen in a hotel before, a machine for making your own fresh waffles (delicious). My only dislike would be tea served from a flask and not in pots. Would certainly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/76/97/df/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

Staff are friendly and welcoming, my later check out was granted without issue.

Breakfast is nothing special.... Not upto a Hilton breakfast, but does the job with limited fruit choices and a real mix of hot items. Help yourself to coffee and juice.

I said the same about the Garden Inn in Birmingham, the IMac as a TV in the room is a real gimmick, but the screen is so small i would actually prefer a normal TV... I dont sit in bed with my contacts in and the screen is tiny!

Wifi is fast and free!

My only gripe would be the car parking! Unless you are there at 3pm (check in time) you won't get a space! I paid £10 a night to park but as the barrier wasn't down all weekend you could probably get away without paying (i mentioned it at check out, lesson learnt next time!)

Nice hotel would certainly book again.

A good highway motel, nothing more. But the parking... Hotel´s own parking has a limited number of places. If you find a free place, ok, if not, you have to park in a public parking 150 meter far; now, the public parking is in the absolute darkness, and you can not leave there the car, pay, and forget your car till the time of going away, no - you have to wake up at 7:55 am, and go to pay at 8:00 to avoid a ticket. I did not want to park in a such uncomfortable place, so after a eight hour trip I had to wait about 35 minutes outside the hotel, for somebody leaving the hotel´s own parking. Can´t Hilton have some agreement with the City of Bristol, to allow guests to pay in advance at the evening? If you travel by plane or railway, it is a good place for one or two nights. An iMac in rooms, a good idea to surf the web, a bad idea to watch TV - too small screen.

The only thing was the menu. It had only 3 things on the main course and we were staying 3 nights on the wine and dine deal. It turns out you do not get breakfast for a start and if you were a veggie all you could have was macaroni cheese for evening meal. 
The menus do not change even the soup was tomato and basil every night Don't get me wrong the food I had was excellent to choices are rubbish. But my husband and our friend had the pork and it was bland they said.
I had rang Hilton main switchboard to make sure of the deal and he assured me we would get breakfast. On Thursday night I rang again regarding times as we wanted to go to the theatre. He informed me that we only had one bottle of wine per booking for one night and service started at 7 (wrong it is 6.30 and we got one bottle of wine per booking every night but no breakfast) so be aware.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-08-26","2013-08-26","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r174159289-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Excellent shower and again it was clean and well resourced in terms of towels and toiletries. The hotel itself was very good and well kept. Great location and walking distance to the station (we travelled by train- a good way to avoid parking and hassle!) and also the main attractions Bristol has to offer. At check in the staff were polite and friendly and as we arrived early on the Saturday morning offered to store our bags so we could venture out until our room was ready.
My only gripe was breakfast. Not the food- this was very good and plentiful- but the wait on Sunday morning (25/08) was poor. The hotel seemed to be very busy and as people arrived at the café they had to give their room number to a member of staff and wait for a free table. Not a problem if you only wait a few minutes and it is done in order but we were somehow forgotten and in the end we simply found a table ourselves. There seemed to be some sort of staffing issues as there were a number of table left not cleared and people hanging around for a table. The breakfast area itself was quite cramped and in hotels of this size I have seen much larger serveries and sometimes two to spread the load.
Monday was better and even though we had to again wait a few minutes we were given a smile and a coffee! 
Overall an very good stay and a great weekend- just find a better system at breakfast!","0","","2013-08-31","2013-08-26","2013-08-26","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r174132623-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room itself was big enough and well equipped. The reception staff mainly friendly and helpful but lack of smiles we read about in the review before we booked were sadly lacking with our main receptionist who booked us in. However other receptionists smiled readily. The restaurant was pleasant but something needs to be done about the awful toaster, the food was excellent with lots of choice. If you order the starter chicken and chips from the bar, be very aware that they are very well seasoned in fact far to much salt was used. The hotel is within easy reach of the town centre and railway station but a bus service passes the door of the hotel and is relatively cheap. 
The head housekeeper was extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble for her. We would definitely stay here again.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-08-25","2013-08-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r173996223-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Parking is very tight, be confident at reversing as there is no where to turn around but I did find a space okay and there is also a nearby public car park.
The position of the hotel is brilliant, a nice walk through the park at the back of the hotel brings you into town.
My room was at the rear of the hotel and was very quiet. TV was watched through the computer but this was okay. Room was clean and bed comfortable.

There was a problem with roosting seagulls over the car park, which meant a number of vehicles looked very worse-for-wear after being parked for a few hours. We had to wash our windscreen before we could drive off, which is not great for a £10 per 24hr charge. 
The carpark was the only negative point however. Overall, this is an impressive hotel with good facilities and a nice central(ish) location.

We arrived mid afternoon on a Friday and took the last parking space in front of the hotel. Parking is at a premium here and, though there is a car park to the rear, it is a good idea to try to arrive as early as you can to get a space.

Check in was competently handled and we were able to access our room immediately. The decor was modern and light. Coffee and tea making facilities were provided (though getting extra milk cartons each day seemed tougher than it might have been) and a fridge was available. As before, there was a reasonable amount of wardrobe space. 

A desk, an Apple computer which doubled as a TV and a reasonable number of power points were provided though the business traveller might wish for more space and the TV remains a little small for modern tastes. Free wifi is a major plus.

We had a double bed which was a reasonable size with a summer duvet. The duvet was a little on the short side. I had asked in advance for non feather pillows. These were not at first provided and making them so seemed more difficult than I had anticipated. 

The bathroom was as before though this time around everything worked satisfactorily. As other reviewers have noted, only a shower is available.

I was pleased to hear that the hotel is no longer taking bookings from stag and hen parties, though these can of course book indirectly through third party providers. This time around our sleep was not disturbed.

We ate breakfast in the restaurant and service was good even when busy. The buffet options were much as you might expect though the packets of cereal and the absence of decent wholemeal or granary bread were disappointments. We did not eat dinner in the hotel but ate three light bites for £12 between us which was ample for an evening supper for two.

The hotel is ten minutes away from the city centre and close to Templemeads station and remains a very good choice as a centrally placed, reasonably priced Bristol option.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-08-19","2013-08-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r172918353-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

First impressions - smart and stylish. Reception staff were excellent from check in to check out. Room was small but perfectly formed. Everything you needed from a hotel room was spot on and extremely clean and fresh. The IMac was a great touch and there was free wifi throughout the hotel. Bed was super comfy which with the quietness fab to recharge the batteries.  Had afternoon tea from a Travel Zoo voucher.  We had paid the slightly higher price to include a lovely bottle of sparkling rosé and the cakes and sandwich selection and amounts were really good value.  Breakfast was one of the best I've had in a Hilton with plenty of choice and all very fresh.  On our last day we popped back for lunch and even though the City Cafe was very busy (as used extensively during the day for business meetings) the service and quality of food was excellent. Special mention for Dave who had a smile on his face even though he was dealing with many customers in the rush.  Had an excellent rate from Hilton Honours Great Getaway for £68 I think which was amazing value for money B&B. We will definitely be back.

The hotel is really very good and reasonably priced and it is just the restaurant which badly lets things down.
The hotel staff are all very friendly, efficient and helpful and went out of their way to make to make our stay enjoyable.  Both check in and check out were quick and both on the way in and out we were able to have our luggage stored so that we could make the most of our days in Bristol.
The rooms, as others have commented, are not large – but they have everything required including plenty of teas and coffee, free WiFi, hanging and drawer space, a laptop safe, fridge you can put your own things in and the Apple TV/Computer.  Beds are super comfortable with great pillows and duvet.  The bathroom has a good shower but no tub – fine for a few nights.  In the reception area there is also a small shop selling soft drinks, biscuits and hot and cold snacks (microwave available for the hot ones); this is a nice touch particularly if you want something late at night.
The hotel is in a great position for Temple Meads Station, the Bristol Ferry and is a 10 minute walk into the heart of the city with plenty of buses close by (including one to the zoo) if you don’t feel like walking.
But now to turn to the bad!  We had one evening meal in the restaurant and to say it resembled “Fawlty Towers” is an understatement.  We waited five minutes to be seated and then another thirty minutes for our order to be taken; in that time we were totally ignored and not even offered drinks.  In fact in the end we attracted a waitress’s attention else I suspect that we would have never been served.  Had the first night’s dinner not been inclusive in our room rate I would have probably left at that point.
After our order was taken the drinks appeared quickly, but it was a further half-hour before our starters appeared – a salad and soup.  In all it took nearly 2.5 hours to have three courses by which time I couldn’t face another wait for coffee!  Given it is a simple and very limited menu and the restaurant was not that busy – most tables had only one cover and several were empty – it is just unbelievable why it takes a hotel restraint this long to deliver a meal.  And whilst our waitress tried her best to keep us happy, there seemed no acknowledgement from any of the hotel/restaurant management that there was a problem.
Breakfast was little better.  The food is very nice – when it is there – but they were constantly running out of things.  Often there was no reserve supplies to bring out – which may be forgivable on a Sunday when it is more difficult with deliveries, but this was a problem on Friday and Saturday too.  For the most part it was customers telling staff food had run out and there seemed little proactive going on to keep things stocked.
I would thoroughly recommend the hotel and breakfast is OK for a few days, but avoid taking dinner here at all costs.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-08-17","2013-08-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r172683224-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I booked the Hilton Gardens online via Trivago for £71 but was please to find a 10% discount code so only paid £63-worth looking around for a deal as this was an absolute bargain since it included breakfast. The hotel room was small, light, very modern, and extremely clean, The iMac was a brilliant addition even though we didn't spend enough time there to make use of it. The bed was really comfortable and we had a good night's sleep. Great shower too. The buffet breakfast was excellent, fantastic choice of food and though we were still full from our Indian meal the previous evening as soon as we smelt the breakfast we couldn't resist. Nice to have daily papers to read while eating. All in all a really good experience for us, we don't stay in hotels very often so want it to be an enjoyable time which this was. I read on other reviews about £10 parking fees but this wasn't mentioned to us and as we used the quick checkout (there was a queue when we are ready to leave) perhaps we just got lucky. One word of advice, if you book online via Trivago or similar make sure you have all relevant paperwork-I printed out the confirmation form but there was a problem when we booked in as they didn't seem to have us on their system. However the receptionist was really helpful and dealt with it without a fuss, but it could have been awkward. Would recommend and would be happy to return here.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-08-17","2013-08-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r172621495-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

the room was small but very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Every room had an apple I mac in which was very handy there was also free wifi through out the hotel.
The buffet breakfast was good and there was plenty of choice.
If I had 1 criticism it was that the hotel charged £10 per night for parking which I found extortionate. 
But that aside i'll be sure to stay there again as it was a very pleasant stay.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-08-15","2013-08-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r172421878-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms were very nice (not very big however) and modern and clean. Lots of electric plugs and beds were comfortable.

The only 2 points which dropped a star are a tiny bathroom, and TV over internet which was not fast enough to allow seamless watching. Personally I dislike Apple and found the iMac incredibly frustrating but I clearly realise that for this I'm in a minority.

However for the really important points - quiet room (even though we were on the road side of the hotel), cleanliness, bed and sleep quality, all were excellent so we can only recommend this hotel and would look forward to staying again.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-08-14","2013-08-14","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r172271545-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The atmosphere in the city cafe is also really lovely.

Only problem our flush was a little broken but as the rest of the room/hotel was good quality I assume this was work in progress. 

Ideal location, although on the main road, noise cannot be heard inside. 5 minute walk into city center, 5 minute walk to Harbourside. Just round the corner from Temple Meads Train station. 

This was exactly what I'd expect from a hotel, we had a pleasant stay and i would recommend this hotel to anyone. 

Breakfast was a bit pricey, £7 per person - and that was half price! 
Parking was supposed to be £10 for 24hours but they don't seem to have charged us for this - perhaps its free on weekends?

We were on breakfast & evening meal arrangement, breakfast was good helpful & friendly staff had omelette every morning they were so good, evening meal was OK on 1st night & from then on got gradually worse took an age to get served on average it took over 2 hour's to complete a 3 course meal, on our last night took 1hour before we had our starter served & another 1 &1/2 hours before we had completed our meal, free drinks did not make up for this bad service, 
I am glad our coach only had 17 persons on if it had been full 50 persons I am sure there would have been a riot on our last night, We began to feel that we were being treated as 2nd class guest's because we had already paid for our stay in advance as other people came in to the restaurant & were served & away before we got our 1st course.

I arrived by train from London and had an easy walk along the quayside to the hotel. I arrived at the hotel a little before 11:00 in the morning, and sheepishly asked if there was a room available so that I check in early and get a shower and some rest (I had flown into London from the USA that morning). There was a room, and the receptionist offered it to me with a big smile.

My room was at the back side of the hotel away from the main road, so it was nice and quiet. The room was well appointed, with all the main boxes checked for my ideal business hotel room (nice sized desk, flat-screen TV, iron and ironing board, and safety lock box). I did not have dinner in the hotel, but the breakfast buffet (well priced at just 7.50 pounds) was varied and generous, with an omelette station set up as well. The hotel has a small fitness room that opens at 6:00am, but get there one time if you want to guarantee a treadmill).

All in all this was a very good stay, and I appreciate the staff's extra effort to make my experience an enjoyable one. Well recommended. I would definitely stay here again next time I am in Bristol.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-08-08","2013-08-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r171338106-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms are clean, modern and well furnished. The iMac in the room is a great alternative to a tv. Food here is pretty good and not crazily expensive. 

Location wise, it's a short walk into town or to Temple Meads station.

Staff were friendly, efficient and polite. The only negative was someone parking across the back of my car in a hatched area due to the lack of parking spaces. One 50 point turn later, I was able to leave. The barrier was up, which meant I was excused the £10 parking fee.

I like this hotel and enjoyed my stay.

The bed was comfy but the pillows were too hard, one pillow wasn't enough but two was too many. The Mac computer in the room is a nice touch although I didnt use it for the internet. Wifi was good too. Check in was good, the receptionist was happy to let me leave my case with them as my room wasn't ready when I originally checked in. I didn't eat in the hotel so cannot comment on this but some colleagues have and rate the breakfast quite highly. Short walk (about 10 minutes) to Cabot Circus and only a few minutes to temple meads station. All in all an ok experience, I would give it 3.5 out of 5.","1","","2013-07-31","2013-08-05","2013-08-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r170890569-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Having stayed at Hiltons before and found them good hotels we went with this which seemed a good location. The room was excellent and the Apple I Mac which doubled as a tv was a good bonus. The city centre and shopping area was only a short walk or quick bus ride away. Only wish we had found out about a huge wetherspoons and bar area hidden round the corner but discovered this on the last night. On the first day we had a snack in the hotel bar which at £5 for a cheese toastie was extortionate (Thats why I wish we had known about the wetherspoons!) The breakfast was very good with the waffle maker something different. The sausages had a strange taste though. All the staff were friendly and helpful. All in all a lovely hotel to stay in.

The location (less than 10 minutes stroll from Temple Meads railway station, and from the habourside) is ideal, and the hotel is comfortable, and affordable too (if booked far enough in advance).

I have stayed at the hotel on many occasions, and based on my experiences this trip, the hotel seems to be doing a good job of maintaining standards of cleanliness and general upkeep. Bedding, towels and the overall comfort of the bedroom were good - and the iMac in the room offered a good selection of TV channels.

Just a few little details to attend to, and I'd give the hotel five stars!! The wi-fi (though free, and available throughout the hotel) was somewhat patchy in the bedroom. The fridge in the room, although switched on, didn't seem to be very cool. And, the reception staff need to learn how to smile!! At checkout in particular, the reception staff seemed to be rather surly and unwelcoming.","0","","2013-08-31","2013-08-03","2013-08-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r170567688-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

That said, the place is in great condition and very well looked after everywhere. Spotless and well maintained. 

However, the people will always be why I return to any hotel in the world, and a special mention for Shumi, the Housekeeper for her special touches to the room....thank you so much, it was like coming home. Also the reception team, when my partner arrived hours before me she had early access to the room & when I extended my stay nothing was a problem, the bar & restaurant team, good to catch up with you all. I should say here, I spent some time almost living there a couple of years ago and loved it.

I'll be back again....probably for the Harbour Festival next year!

The location is good for accessing central Bristol attractions but parking is a complete lottery with inadequate spaces for the hotel size.

We stayed in Garden room 118 and while this was fairly compact it was comfortable as you would expect of the Hilton chain.

Unfortunately, and as you WOULD NOT EXPECT of the Hilton chain, our stay was marred by drunken stag guests banging on hotel room doors and swearing at 04:00 am. This was allowed to continue and was totally ignored by management (how such clearly inebriated individuals were allowed to enter the premises defeats me!)

Clearly hotel management cannot be responsible for 'guest' behaviour but they have obligations to ensure the safety and enjoyment of real guests.

So in summary, a pleasant enough hotel stay tarnished by apathetic security and management.

Sorry Mr Hilton you need to do much better than this, and we will not be back...","0","","2013-07-31","2013-07-25","2013-07-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r169047593-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

A Tesco express is very nearby which is great for snacks, magazines etc. A small park is located outside the hotel and provided a nice view from my window. 

The bedroom itself was great. An Apple Mac computer served as both a computer and a TV and I found this excellent for doing some work, browsing the internet and watching TV.
The room seemed very new and modern and I can't fault the decor. 
Tea and coffee making facilities, a mini fridge (empty so you can fill it with your own drinks and snacks), and an iron meant I had all the essentials for  comfortable stay. 
The only fault I will say was that the air conditioning was very poor and the room was on one night almost unbearably warm. The window only opens a couple of inches (great for security reasons) meaning there wasn't much of a breeze that could come in. 

The staff were very friendly and welcoming and I found dining in the hotel to be a great experience. 

Breakfast had all the usual food items (fruits, cereals,cheese, meat, juices, tea and coffee bread for toasting, hot buffet) as well as a great addition of a waffle iron! You were able to make yourself a fresh waffle by pouring the batter on the iron. A great and tasty idea.

I ate dinner on two occasions and was pleased with the standard of food. A small menu but I believe there is something to suit most tastes. Great portion sizes and cooked to a high quality. 

From what I saw of the rest of the hotel, it all seemed very clean and well maintained with modern decor. 

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Bristol and indeed if I am travelling to Bristol again in future I will book this hotel.","0","","2013-06-30","2013-07-24","2013-07-24","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r168890433-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Check in was efficient, and we asked for an upgrade and were given a quiet room on the upper floors overlooking the park.  The room wasnt big, but OK for our purposes.  Bathroom was small, but had good powerful shower.  The bed was comfortable.  Location is good.

The only gripes I would have was the air conditioning was ineffective, despite putting it on manual controls, the room was still uncomfortable.  I did ask for a fan, which was sent to my room.

Breakfast was not so good.  We have stayed at the HIlton Garden chain before in Aberdeen and were very impressed.  This hotel was disappointing.  There was nobody in situ to fry eggs.  The bacon had a grey tinge to it and looked like it had been boiled or steamed rather than fried.  Sausages were salty and lacking flavour tea came in a mug with teabag rather than a teapot.

I would stay here again for the location, but would hope that the aircon and breakfast could be improved.","0","","2013-07-31","2013-07-22","2013-07-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r168526646-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is well situated for the city and Bristol Temple Meads, and is clean and modern. The room was lovely, again, clean and modern with an iMac and very comfy bed. The dinner menu was a little limited, but the breakfast was outstanding! Usual full English and pastries available but also waffles, which made my Sunday morning! The staff were attentive and friendly - I often find the staff let down otherwise good hotels, but this certainly wasn't the case here, all the staff we came into contact with were helpful and super smiley! 

The only small negative was that the room was rather warm, the air con didn't seem to do much, but to be fair it was an insanely hot weekend (not normal for the UK!). 

I'd definitely come back here again, particularly with a similar special offer.","0","","2013-07-31","2013-07-21","2013-07-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r168462222-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was clean and tidy with everything we needed and a few extras. Whether or not they were intended for our consumption, the fridge (very welcome during our stay as it was during the extended warm period) came equipped with 2 yoghurts and a double choc muffin, which we decided best not to eat, just in case.

We had booked through a third party for a Queen Evolution Room, but on check in were allocated a twin room. I wasn't too fussed, but my other half was not so happy. Perhaps the guy who checked us in thought the booking was a mistake, but 2 gay guys can share a bed, can't they?

The hotel is conveniently located a short stroll from Templemeads Station and from the city centre.

The I Mac in the room was a nice touch, even though the lag on the tv was a bit annoying at times, once you found how to turn the thing on. A handily placed instruction leaflet near the button outfoxed my other half (an Apple virgin) but still, it was a nice thing to have in the room.

The Pantry downstairs was a nice idea, although the prices were a bit steep.

Despite being located right next to a main road, there was no noise from the outside with the windows closed and the other residents seemed to be considerate.

All in all, a nice hotel and I would choose this brand of hotel next time and certainly this hotel if I ever have the pleasure of visiting the beautiful city again.","0","","2013-07-31","2013-07-21","2013-07-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r168419701-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Location was great for the city centre, rooms are perfect plenty of space to hang things up, drawers to put things away, this is lacking in a lot of hotels but not the hilton. Apple Mac in every room, complimentary water in the fridge which was a blessing.
My husband left some items of clothing and they traced them and returned them to us, which we are very greatful for.
Only downside is we won't be back this year but hopefully planning a non-business break for next year.

The restaurant were not sure what the deal covered and there was considerable confusion about which of two different menus we should be offered( they gave us both at different points in the meal) they offered us wine with the deal and then retracted the offer. The meal ended with us being issued a hefty bill for the meal which I refused to sign! They said it would all be sorted by checkout in the morning and it was. I did though pass a bit of a restless night worrying about the possible confrontation in the morning.

We booked this hotel for one night on Friday 12th July for a short city break. We arrived at 12:15pm and managed to find a parking space in the hotel car park. It looks like they do not have an awful lot of spaces and I am sure if the hotel is full, you may not get a space. The spaces themselves are quite tight and I was glad that our car had the bumper beepers to stop us scratching the car. Car Parking for residents was £10 for 24 hours.
When I enquired at check-in if a room was available, bearing in mind we were about 3 hours early, Kayleigh at the desk checked and yes, a room was available on the first floor. The rooms themselves are quite compact more like a studio style with just a shower, no bath, a small desk with an apple I-Mac which doubled as the TV. The window only opened about 2 inches and the air conditioning was a bit weak, so the room did seem hot, but temperatures outside were upto 30 degrees.
Nice toiletries, very clean room, fridge (empty) safe and free wi-fi. I went on the hunt for some Ice and found David in the bar area who went above and beyond in assisting me, even taking time to obtain a map and explain the sights and attractions within walking distance of the hotel. We decided to take a walk and found that shops, bars and restaurants are in easy walking distance of the hotel, after some shopping and an early dinner, we returned to the hotel for a few drinks in the bar. We were served by Hubert, a very nice guy from Poland, who looked after our drinks requirements.
We retired about 10pm and had a somewhat restless night due to the heat and the weak air con, however when we did get up, we were very impressed by the breakfast and the standard choices were there in a buffet format. 
When we checked out, we realised that we had a ‘wine and dine’ package, a fact we had totally forgotten, however the receptionist who handled our check out, took the £10 car parking charge off the bill and gave us a nice bottle of Pinot to take home, free of charge.
Overall a smart, pleasant, boutique style hotel, very central with very friendly and helpful staff, I would recommend this hotel for a short city break although arrive early to get a parking space","0","","2013-07-31","2013-07-13","2013-07-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r167397120-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

For a Hilton - place is starting to get worn. Room - fairly tidy - but small. Bathroom - small, glad I didn't take the cat. The iMac. Great, been on them since they have been in UK.

The rooms are bright and clean with free wifi and a good desk space for working with a free newspaper in the morning.
Although a lot of the staff were polite, even I was more friendly than the manager. 
She seemed disinterested and rude even as I checked out. I didn't have breakfast included, but she did tell me if I told her a day in advance she could add it to my booking for less than adding it in the morning.
I would point out it's a 10minute walk into town through a small street out the back -Church st to Victoria Street, which can seem a bit desolate at night when you're a woman on your own, I opted for room service for two of the nights which was good food.
Still the station is just around the corner and the bus to Clifton- where I needed to travel to was right outside the hotel. As I left I saw a Seagull tucking into a Pigeon in the parking lot... nice.","0","","2013-06-30","2013-07-10","2013-07-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r167074787-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

On arrival it was clear there are a lot of business folk with the amount of briefcases,newspapers and suits! But that didn't bother us in our summer clothes and flip flops we were still made to feel welcome!The facilities looked good even though we didn't really use  them they looked very helpful including a 24 hr pantry where you can purchase anything from a snack to a microwave meal! We were offered a morning paper and a wake up call which we didn't need but was nice to be offered! The room was very clean and at the right temperature for this weather! The room included a fridge,ice bucket,hair dryer (thank god),clock radio,iron,ironing board,air con and an I-MAC which just reminded us we have spoilt ourselves a bit staying at this hotel! So not only could you watch tv, you could also watch a dvd,surf the net,play games,listen to music via iTunes and much more! Also there is free wifi connection in the hotel and you dont need to sign up or log on it connects automatically!
The bed was quite hard and the pillows were soft which was ok for me but my partner didn't sleep well at all and this was the only let down! I do feel however if we had asked for not so soft pillows I feel we probably would have got them!
Breakfast was lush! Very fresh both cooked and continental buffet style! There was also a menu made fresh to order including smoked salmon and waffles!
Overall we had a great stay and felt welcome! 

Its a shame my partner didn't sleep so well!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/2b/d1/30/i-mac.jpg","2013-07-31","2013-07-10","2013-07-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r167008748-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We used a meeting room on the first day, which had everything we needed, with refreshments toppped up throughout the day. We were also asked to pre-order lunch in the restaurant, which saved hanging around.

My room was nicely decorated, and felt quite new. The bathroom was small, but well designed, with a clever shower door. The bed was comfortable, and I had a very good night's sleep. There was an iMac in the room, which doubled up as a tv, which was a nice touch.

There was also free WiFi - well done Hilton!

The car park is very small and cramped, and can't be pre-booked. Temple Meads train station is nearby, so presumably most people arrive by train.","0","","2013-07-31","2013-07-08","2013-07-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r166701583-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We were warmly greated by reception, the room was of very high quality and very clean. This being a city centre hotel the bathroom was compact, but very comfortable, great shower and plenty of space for a couple.

We ate in the restaurant on the first night we stayed and the food was amazing. We were pleasantly surprised as to just how good the food was. The staff were very friendly polite and helpful.

The hotel is in a great location and I recommend booking a park view room as we found there was no noise at all and a pleasant view to wake up to. Would definitly stay here again.","1","","2013-05-31","2013-07-02","2013-07-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r166028577-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Other than the station I find the hotel someone lost and stranded halfway between town and the cabot circus area which are each a 10min walk away. 

Rooms are standard for HGI: very small and more basic than Hilton hotels but with just about everything you need. I personally don't like the iMac TV setup as the screen is small and the remote control is quite limiting but I know others love it. Adjustable air conditioning is great and a must in summer.

Breakfast has all the usual hot and cold food offerings. Food in the restaurant is of a high standard and comes highly recommended amongst a number of cab drivers and locals to Bristol. This is fortunate as there aren't many restaurants near the hotel.","1","","2013-04-30","2013-06-30","2013-06-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r165752758-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was very small and the bed was a double with a double duvet which didn't allow for some overhang. There is limited car parking space although we were fortunate. Once we parked we didn't move it for the two nights we were there. The biggest moan was the breakfast. Always only warm or near cold and sausages both days were severely undercooked. No reliable  ''egg'' person on duty. The tables NEVER set properly so I was up and down either asking for waitress help or grabbing from other tables.

For a hotel chain that promotes itself as a business person's choice I was surprised to be be greeted with ""sorry the car park is full, but you can park across the street"" (in an unlit public parking lot). Which meant that the car had to be emptied which was inconvenient. I was also told that if I could move my car to the hotel parking lot before 8 the following morning, I wouldn't have to pay anything across the street. Fine, the problem was that at 8 in the morning the hotel parking was still full. And continued to be so until I checked out. 
The room was nice even though too spacious, which made me wonder what there was both a chair and an armchair in it?
The bathroom was (no kidding) 1.5 x 1.5 meters (5 x 5 feet) and in that space there were two doors that needed space to be opened. It resembled a restroom on an aeroplane.
The bed was firm, which was probably the best part part of the stay. (besides the iMac/TV which was nice combination. Now all you need to do is hook it up to a printer too)
The noisy aircond was a nuisance, that made me shut it off and sleep with the window open instead.
Checking out was a hassle and extra delayed because the elevator was stuck on the third floor, and the bags had to be carried down from the third floor. The breakfast staff did it's best to spread joy, but why did I have to order a boiled egg? Isn't this something that can be ready? The extensive selection of cereals seems important to the hotel, but why only offer a single cheese selection (in thick slices) on your breakfast buffé?
So this Hilton Garden only gets an OK. No more and no less.","1","","2013-06-30","2013-06-29","2013-06-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r165675174-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We knew the standard room is ok for size, the breakfast choice extensive and it's location perfect as a base from which to conduct a walking tour of the city centre area and its attractions.

This time we had dinner in the restaurant - it was a superb evening from the moment we were greeted in the bar and the first conversations on drinks and menu selection.

Of particular note is the consistently high standard of conduct we've observed among all the staff with whom we've had contact. Welcoming, courteous and responsive to our requests are just some of their strong points and this has been our experience on all our stays. Three good visits merits a mention on Tripadvisor - well done, Hilton.","0","","2013-06-30","2013-06-17","2013-06-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r164297204-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Not far to walk to local restaurants. However, the downside is that the hotel faces a very busy main road (Temple Way). Rooms on the back face Temple Church Garden, which is very pleasant and quiet, although you can still hear traffic at the front during the day (with the window open). I don't think I would want to stay at the front. First impression is that the interior is bit clinical and that the reception area is uninviting. Modestly sized rooms have similar furnishings to a Doubletree with comfortable bed and pillows with a lightweight duvet. The bathroom is small (shower only). Tea and coffee making facilities, ironing board and small fridge. Good breakfast with freshly cooked eggs and waffles, though tea and coffee were a bit hard to come by on one of the days. Good free wi-fi and an Apple TV/computer. Overall good value.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/06/e0/10/bedroom.jpg

Standard double room was good, if a little small -- the shower-room was definitely tiny and wedged in a corner, but perfectly acceptable.  Comfortable bed.  Adjustable air conditioning.  Apple iMac in the room doubled as computer and TV was appreciated as was free wifi.  Self-service breakfast (included in our package) was excellent with wide choice of options; good bacon and super herby sausages.  Bar and restaurant menu was rather more limited than expected -- it looked more like many hotels' room service menu.  Having said that the fish & chips was good cod (not like many who serve who knows what fish these days) and the burgers were also good; onion rings probably the best I've ever had.  Range of draught beer also very disappointing.  Staff always friendly and helpful; you did get the feeling nothing would be too much trouble.  Beware the rather ferocious lift doors!  Would have liked a swimming pool, but I knew when booking there wasn't one.  Close to Temple Meads Station an advantage for train traveller, though it is a nasty 5 minute walk across a manic roundabout.  Fix the restaurant menu, the beer and the swimming pool and this would be outstanding.","0","","2013-06-30","2013-06-10","2013-06-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r163580174-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We checked in(10 minutes early!) and went up to the room which was clean, spacious, bright and well equipped(apple computer/tv, 'fridge', hair dryer, safe, lovely shower).
The fridge wasnt actually a fridge hense the inverted commas although when we asked about this at reception we were told it used to be a mini bar and isnt actually a working fridge, more of a cooler, so bear this in mind if like us you want a bottle of wine make sure you buy one in bristol already chilled.
We forgot toothpaste, which was available to buy from reception which was helpful, there was also a selection of snacks and various beverages.

We only stayed for one night but the staff were helpful, we only came in contact with the receptionists as we didnt use the cafe etc. but they were all very helpful, especially Annie the supervisor. She took time to draw directions on maps, print maps, explain to us the quickest routes, recommending places that were nice to visit(Bath) and then even after our first night ask us the next day if we had a nice night the night before for which she'd given us directions to the harbour. She provided excellent personal service and was a lovely woman, an excellent ambassador for the hotel and hilton group.

As I said we only stayed for one night and it was really just a bed for the night as we didnt spend much time in the hotel but wanted to explore bristol and the surrounding areas, but the room and hotel in general were excellent and friendly customer service made it better.","0","","2013-06-30","2013-06-09","2013-06-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r163489702-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It took a short walk from Bristol Temple Mead railway station, but I should have called the hotel in advance for directions.

I passed through a very pleasant brick office area on my way there, which perhaps was rebuilt from scratch about 10 years ago. I checked in early, was immediately given a room, and then found my room to be very modern and gleaming, with new blond wood and an iMAC combination computer-tv.

Throughout my two day stay the reception staff was exceptionally pleasant and helpful in a several different ways. Wifi is free. 

It was a three minute short across the River Severn to the centre city and market.","0","","2013-06-30","2013-06-06","2013-06-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r163161238-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms were very clean n nice showers were very gd n beds nice n comfy. 
Had other stag doo's staying at same time and people on a weekend break too which all seemed fine even when I was made to dress up for the two days staff and other guest had no problem at all. 
Staff were even very accommodating when we were coming back at 4am from a night out making us coffee n drinks whilst we ate takeout in the bar area. 
The breakfast food was very good and there was a large variety of full English, continental, waffles, fruit and cereal was something for every one.
All in all this is a nice hotel which I would def come back to again with my wife as it is in a great location for getting in Bristol city centre and exploring the area.

We were staying for 2 nights and eventually opted for the 'Room, Wine & Dine' offer, which included a 3 course dinner + a bottle of wine the first evening, together with half price breakfast on both mornings. We weren't disappointed. The hotel was spotlessly clean - on both days we saw members of staff cleaning & touching up paintwork scuffs on several floors. After reading a review regarding possible road noise, we paid an extra fiver for a room overlooking the small park at the rear of the hotel, away from the main road & heard no noise at all, perfect! Rooms were well designed, with thoughtful touches like hinged mirror panels on the wall - useful to see the back of your head when drying hair; there was also a magnifying mirror in the well-lit bathroom - good to see the female traveller being catered for! An iMac was a great addition & there was also a lockable small fridge. 
City Café, the hotel restaurant & bar, was excellent - I'm not usually a fan of buffet style breakfasts, but there was plenty of choice available and the hot food was all freshly cooked. There was also a varied choice on the evening dinner menu. Our meals were all delicious. The only negative point was the dreadful coffee offered at breakfast - the waitress agreed it was disgusting & offered to make a fresh coffee from the bar, which was lovely. 
The staff really do set the standard for customer service here - everyone was friendly & professional. The lovely Bristolian lady cooking eggs at breakfast deserves a special mention for the smiley welcome she gave everyone. We would certainly stay here again.","0","","2013-05-31","2013-06-03","2013-06-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r162899601-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It was real value for money.  After the bank holiday it would have been 50%off). We booked via expedia.Suggestion:1. Rooms could have been a bit more spacious. 
2. When a single person occupies a double room and pay the same amount, the buffet b'fast charge for one must be taken off. 3.

The address, Temple Way doesn't really tell you where it is as Temple Way is a bit of a stretch, there is no number on the building, so my walk from the Central Bus station, with luggage, was about 20-25 minutes.  The room was extremely well appointed and clean and the service was quite good, so it well enough made up for the distance I had to walk.  But if you are in town to enjoy the city, the nightlife, and the urban feel, this might be slightly off the beaten path.  But overall it was a lovely place, clean, quite and well managed.","0","","2013-05-31","2013-05-28","2013-05-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r162210858-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms are very clean and the iMac a great feature. The thing that sets this hotel apart from others we have stayed in is the fantastic staff. I mentioned in passing when i booked that the visit was for our anniversary and this had been noted and when we were served our deserts they had piped Happy Anniversary around both plates. This was typical of the personal touch you got from all the staff we met, always happy to help. To make this a balanced review I have to mention a couple of negatives. Firstly the set dinner menu main courses of which there were only 3 was the same both nights we stayed and with one being a vegetarian choice left us feeling that the menu was a tad lazy, especially given that there were many dishes on the main restaurant menu being served. The other negative could be the parking. We were fortunate enough to get a space but had we not would have faced driving elsewhere and walking back which is not ideal after travelling.  Otherwise a great hotel in a great location with fantastic staff. We would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone.

The hotel itself is fine and the rooms are well appointed, however, the room seemed to be a lot smaller than before.

The two issues I had were firstly with the carpark, I've never seen such narrow spaces and to try and cram even more cars in the staff were allowing people to park in the yellow hatched area making getting out even harder. On my second night I couldn't get back in the carpark so had to park around the corner and then get up before 8am to move.

The second issue is with room service and it only being available between 5pm-10pm. Outside of those hours the only option is to go down to the rather naff 'Pavillion' where there is a selection of snacks and microwave meals available. I really don't know why room service isn't available throughout the day if not later at night and whilst it didn't matter to me it didn't even seem like breakfast in your room was a possibility.","0","","2013-05-31","2013-05-28","2013-05-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r162092736-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We had a standard double room and it was clean and tidy as expected. The room was spacious and had the Apple imac tv.  The bathroom was small but spotless and the bathroom products were really good.  It was also a pleasant surprise to find an iron and ironing board in the room!

Check-in was efficient and although our room wasn't ready (we got there early), staff were happy to hold on to our bags and give us any help we needed in finding our way around Bristol.

Breakfast was included in the room rate and there was a reasonable selection available.  The hot food was fresh - it didn't feel like it had been sitting around for ages, with eggs on demand.  The hotel also has a pantry in the reception area which is handy for buying snacks and drinks at all hours (there is no stocked mini-bar in the rooms).

All in all, a comfortable nights sleep in a very conveniently located hotel.  We would stay again.","0","","2013-05-31","2013-05-28","2013-05-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r162091600-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Again a most enjoyable experience,my mother had a lovely time.the staff are consistently considerate and kind- really good recruitment process! We had an issue with the safe and telephone not working,within minutes maintenance had it sorted and we were given a miniature replica toolkit with hammer shaped mints in it. A nice touch.
We do not have breakfast as we don't eat much in the morning but there are some nice small cafes in the street behind, through the park,Victoria st. There is also a Tesco express for bits and pieces for the fridge. It is also where you can pick up the open top bus at Novotel.At the top of this street there is a really nice restaurant The Glass Boat on the river.
We have recommended this hotel to lots of people due to the staff, cleanliness, relaxed comfort ,location and the price.

Gave up on drinking and went to bed.
And very glad we did not stay longer than 2 nights this is because of the very noisy air flow system running alongside the air conditioning system in each room. As the air conditioning was not needed we thought we could put up with the noise but by midnight on the first night we gave in and called reception only to be told this same problem had been mentioned before we could be moved but no guarantees that the noise levels would be any less. My husband was taken to another room to judge the noise levels and it was no different and so disposable ear phones were offered and a free breakfast in the morning. Fortunately I have an inventive husband who removed the air vent which just lifts down and stuffed a pair of socks in the end of the tube to baffle the noise this did not block the flow but stopped the air from rushing across the vent causing most of the disturbance.
This was all a shame as location perfect for city centre, bed very comfortable, breakfast amazing choice and staff very attentive besides the problems.","1","","2013-05-31","2013-05-13","2013-05-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r160602389-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

That's just the things I found as didn't open every cupboard and drawer! Comfy bed, room was lovely and light with a big window, I had a view of the road but didn't notice any noise.
The only slight niggle is the car park. The spaces were so small! I got the last one that you could fit a car in, there were a couple others but there was no way I was getting in them! Didn't really mind the £10 charge, would cost you that anywhere overnight and you can walk most places from them hotel.

The staff were friendly, and managed to get us into our room earlier than the usual check-in time as we arrived early. We had a ""garden view"" room, although I couldn’t really see much garden from the window(!).
 
I booked this hotel through Hilton direct, over the phone, and used my Hilton Hhonours points, so it didn't cost anything. Being a Silver member we got a free newspaper and bottled water too.

I am glad we didn’t bring our car, because it was rather expensive to park overnight (I think around £15.00).

We walked into Bristol City Centre for a bite to eat, and this was about another 10 minute walk. 
The rooms were clean, comfortable and modern, no problems at all (apart from the apple mac in the room kept giving us static electric shocks! I was scared to touch it after a while!)

Overall a nice hotel, I would recommend, and use them again in the future.","0","","2013-03-31","2013-05-11","2013-05-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r160408889-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Which is fine, although the only disadvantage I could see was it meant you couldn't turn the tv on from bed, if you wanted to. You could turn it off with the remote, but not on. Ah well. The free wifi was appreciated.

The cupboards seemed to have lights inside that turn on when the door is opened, but these weren't working in my room. Well, the lights in the wardrobe flashed briefly and went out. I guess the bulbs need changing. In other electronic malfunctions, the lifts were apparently out of order for my first full day there. Well, the hotel was very busy that day - maybe they collapsed under the strain. They worked when I needed to move my luggage.

The staff, while lovely, could be described as a bit scatty. My first dinner reservation went completely AWOL. I was on a dine & wine deal, which meant dinner, with wine, was included for the duration of my stay. I was too late to avail of it the first evening, so got a breakfast voucher instead. Next day, had a good breakfast - the option to make your own waffles is one I haven't seen before - and, as I had been advised, made a reservation for dinner that evening. When I arrived for dinner, the restaurant was crammed, but I said I'd be happy to sit in the bar. Which was lucky, because I then got the option of choosing from the bar menu, which I preferred to the set restaurant menu that comes with this offer, but I was allowed to choose a dessert from the restaurant menu.

On the second evening, the restaurant was much less crowded and I had to choose from the set restaurant menu. Which had the same main courses as the day before. O dear. Well, I did my best, but it just wasn't to my taste, and the brownie I ordered for dessert, which took a solid half hour to arrive, tasted stale.

Check-out was a bit harrowing. After a long-ish queue, I was presented with a bill for about £34. What?! My only charge was one breakfast - I had only eaten two, and one of those was with a voucher (see above). I asked for an itemised bill, which took a while to print (awkward, I was in a hurry) and which showed a whole cluster of different charges. The girl on check-out seemed confused, and told me I was being charged for three breakfasts. She also told me that breakfast was £12.90 (which amount never appeared on the bill, nor any multiple of it). I had to explain the situation to her several times, at the end of which I wasn't charged for any breakfasts at all! Well, whatever.

Overall, a good trip, with minor quibbles.","0","","2013-05-31","2013-05-07","2013-05-07","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r159877527-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

1- we booked via expedia and had a last minute change (bringing our 4year old) i called the hotel who said quite bluntly they wouldnt do anything as it was booked through a 3rd party and i'd have to call them. SOoooo i did...and the expedia gent couldnt be more helpful saying that this was a common issue and they'd speak to the hotel now and get back with me, a few moments on hold and a shocked expedia agent said they had refuse, like in my earlier call to do anything their and id have to see if i could upgrade upon arrival.
2- so we arrive, and check in - the front car park is a nightmare to manouvere around go out the back you have to pay but at least you'll be able to get out. i explain our issue QUITE CLEARERLY stating she is 4 and they advise they will put an extra bed in the room (brilliant!).
So we get in after a 20 minute wait and they've put in a babys cot??!!
So another complain to reception and we're moved to 2 single bed room with an extra fold out bed. ridiculous.

The room in itself was fine, MACs are cool and with me on the laptop watching rugby, my wife on her kindle and my daughter using the mac to play we could all unwind for a few hours.

Dont bother ordering a taxi we wanted one straight away there was a call put in 3 taxis outside for some bloke who wanted in 45 minutes later and they wouldnt take us - god knows where ours went.
So we eneded up, frustrated and annoyed, walking to where we wanted to go!
Another thing that was alarming was that my wife ended up leaving two items of clothing in the room which have mysteriously gone missing?? No call back either.","0","","2013-04-30","2013-05-03","2013-05-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r159534443-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

This was slightly unnerving as usually I plan where I'm staying and do a bit of research beforehand.  However,  the hotel was fine and only about 5 minutes walk from the station.  It looked fairly new although the corridor carpets were being replaced during our stay.  The room had everything we required - the bathroom (shower only) was a bit on the small size but there were a good selection of toiletries and it was clean.  

The walk to the city centre was just over 10 minutes and there was plenty of choice for bars,  clubs and restaurants.  However,  they were geared to a younger crowd than my age group and as the oldest I bowed out around midnight both nights to let the others ""get on with it"".  On Saturday we spent the day at Max events (near the M5 towards Cribbs Causeway) and took part in off road buggies,  Clay shooting and paintball.  overall it was ok but disorganised with a fair bit of waiting around - especially between paintball games.  Fortunately the weather was chilly but not wet which was a plus.

We had breakfast on both days and would recommend waiting until around 0930hrs on Saturday and 1030hrs on Sunday as unless you get there at opening time it can be full and and you'll have to wait whilst items are replaced.  Also,  table service for tea etc will be slower.  That having said,  there was a good selection of food,  eggs can be cooked to order and there was a waffle machine for those with a bit more patience than me.  A larger toaster (or more) would be a suggestion but on the second morning I got into the knack of taking toast already at the bottom of the machine which guests had either forgotten or more likely intended to retrieve as they couldn't be bothered to wait for the cycle to complete (my thanks to them for saving my time!).

If I had a gripe it would be regarding the bedside clock - ours showed the wrong time and we couldn't work out how to change it.  My assumption was that it automatically updated but even the receptionist admitted to not knowing how to change the display time - perhaps some Brain of Britain will let me know the answer in their review?

There's a Tesco Express just the other side of the park and as rooms have an empty fridge you can stock up with drink etc.","0","","2013-04-30","2013-04-30","2013-04-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r159294411-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Contacted the hotel the evening before arrival to advise them of my  intended arrival time at the hotel, ask about parking facilities and to give them my contact details.

Imagine my surprise and disgust upon arrival to find that there were no rooms available at this particular inn. The place was overbooked, but they 'would try and rebook me somewhere else'... 

I asked the very nice and apologetic lady at the front desk to see the operations manager or the general manager, but was advised there was no manager on site.

It transpired other guests were also being turned away and had been waiting for accommodation at other hotels for some time. This, so I was advised, was normal policy at this hotel.

When they tried to rebook me at the nearby Mercure, no rooms were available. 

I asked if the Bristol Hilton was near the airport and if it was available, but was told this was much more expensive. I told them I didn't care, as they would be paying the bill, which in fairness they eventually did.

Yes, the Hilton was near the airport and had rooms, so off we went, but not before Sylvia at the front desk for her kind efforts.

The Hilton turned out to be on the opposite end of town from the airport, but they were welcoming and friendly and actually had rooms. Although they were not owned by the same proprietors as the Garden Inn, they did everything they could to make up for the dismal failures of the Garden Inn. 

A call to the Garden Inn a couple of days later in the hope of speaking to the Operations Manager or the General Manager netted the response that I could have their email addresses... I was eventually told they were not in the office, but would call me back.

You've guessed it: I am still waiting.

Overbooking is bad enough, not having alternative accommodation arranged pretty poor, but not informing me when I have spoken to the hotel the previous evening and they have my contact details is quite simply a disgrace and a long way from the Hilton promise!

If you want somewhere reliable, trustworthy and customer focused and friendly to stay, this clearly isn't the place.","5","","2013-04-30","2013-04-30","2013-04-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r159243513-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Television is by means of free wi fi , very handy for checking e-mails , and able to google info on local restaurants etc.There is a restaurant within the hotel but only a room service menu was provided. We didn't eat there so cannot comment . We used the late bar and the young chap who served us was lovely.
There were 6 of us in total , we had 3 rooms for 3 nights and all of us found the staff very helpful & cheerful . Most especially the service from JANE at breakfast each morning . Even on an extremely busy Sunday morning she still made sure that our whole family were seated quickly and all together. Nothing seemed too much trouble for her and she remained so efficient even at the busiest of times. Breakfast was ample , hot buffet was replenished frequently , eggs cooked to order and even a waffle maker available which really pleased our young granddaughter.","0","","2013-04-30","2013-04-29","2013-04-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r159174548-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

One alight issue was that we didn't get told about breakfast being till 10 on the weekdays and at 12 on the weekend so we came down at 11:15 for breakfast only to find it had finished at 10. But the staff were very helpful and made us some tea which was very nice. 
The location of the hotel was very good near the city center. But the hotel does charge £10 a day to keep your car in there car park which I don't think is right if we are paying to stay there. 
Would stay there again. No questions asked.

On check-inn we were greeted by the receptionist who mumbled something to us, it was only on asking her to repeat herself a couple of times did we eventually understand her as she mumbled thoughout the conversation.  She took our details and promptly told us that there would be a £50 per night( that was £300 as we were staying for 6 nights) reservation put on our credit card just incase we wanted to eat or drink something at the bar, we told her that this would not be the case but she insisted that this has to happen.  On checking our credit card another £100 had been reserved without our knowledge.  This was rather off-putting as us being a small business have to keep an eye on our cash flow as you may understand.

Once checked in I was surprised by the size of the room, it was the smallest room I have stayed in for sometime and the bathroom although being well equipped was very very small, my husband had to contort himself to get into the shower..  On first impressions the room seemed clean but of close inspection there was dust behind the side tables and the bed, mould on the ceiling in the bathroom and on the shower screen.  There was also a rather cumbersome chair placed in the room which had to be moved to enable us to get into the wardrope. The IMAC in the room is certainly not needed and would have preferred a proper flat screen TV.  When trying to watch TV at night the service failed on numerous occasions ( probably due to the strain on the internet)

Another thing is to point out is the lack of acknowledgement when entering the hotel, on almost every occasion either whilst leaving the hotel no acknowledgment was made  this was a little concerning to me from a security point of view.  

This hotel was certainly not in the same league as other Hilton Hotels I have stayed at in the past.  The points I have addressed are not really complaints but should be addressed.","1","","2013-04-30","2013-04-21","2013-04-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r158340893-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel was comfortable and clean. The room was very nice, bed and pillows very comfortable. Terem was a kettle to make tea or coffee in the room, for free. There was an imac computer with free internet access. There was also free wireless acess. The bathroom was not very big mas was Nice and clean and there was a good hairdryer in the room.
There was no room service but there was a small section in reception with some food, toilett products and utilities that you can buy 24 hours a day.
The breakfast was very good. 
Just remember to bring an adapter to electric outlet. The hotel sells it for 7 pounds.","0","","2013-04-30","2013-04-17","2013-04-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r158018910-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

On arrival staff were very pleasant and helpful and we were able to check in at 11 to our rooms no problem.
This hotel is in a great position close to the train station (5-10 min walk) and to the city centre (10-15 min walk) so perfect for what we were after this weekend.
Our room was clean tidy and comfortable and the shower was lovely and a decent size.
The reception staff were very friendly and the lovely man cooking the fried eggs. 
The restaurant did become a little busy so either go early or around 10am to avoid 9 am  rush as the restaurant is quite small.
We added breakfast on when we checked in and got 2 breakfasts for £15 instead of the £13.99 so I would advise this :-)

The parking is very cramped and alot of glass was on the ground too which worried me of the safety of the cars but all was well.
The hotel is very nicely decorated the staff friendly and the room is very well equipped. The iMac is a nice novelty but the speakers did not work very well which was disappointing as i couldn't use my phone to listen to music.
The only fault with the room was the heat, it was very hot despite being cold outside, the window barely opens and we had the air con on but that didn't seem to do much apart from give us both headaches and sinus trouble the following day which is something we don't normally suffer from.
All in all i would stay again due to the location and cleanliness.","0","","2013-04-30","2013-04-12","2013-04-12","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r157513515-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It's not quite in the centre of Bristol, but is about a 10 minute stroll to the main areas where there are plenty of bars, cafe, restaurants etc.The reception staff were very courteous and helpful, and the rooms were comfortable if not particularly large. We only had a breakfast which was adequate with a choice of hot and cold dishes from a buffet, but the dining room can get very busy especially at weekends. A couple of recommendations - there is a fantastic Sardinian bistro called Marco's across the churchyard at the back of the hotel, so a 2 minute walk. Fabulous food, lovely waiting staff, and a great ambience. Secondly if you are in centre of Bristol on a Saturday night, and find everywhere busy (which it usually is!) go to the Watershed cafe/bar where there are usually tables free and the food is also excellent with a choice of small and main meals.","0","","2013-04-30","2013-04-10","2013-04-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r157279123-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

- Clean, well furnished. Nice shower.
- Breakfast was very nice. 
- Great location in between Broadmead and Harbourside, half a mile from each. 
- Apple TV was fab as were the speakers. 

Cons:
- I wouldn't trust the drinks at the bar. The amount of little flies i saw flying around one area was quite disgusting. I found out the hard way during lunch when I found 3 of them in my drink after I had already gone through half of it. I let them know and one of the staff informed me it's a problem they're aware of. As they poured me another glass I kept my eyes peeled and saw a LOT of tiny flies suddenly fly up and away. Quite frankly it ruined my lunch as I was left wondering how many of them I had consumed in my drink. I was very relieved it was isolated to the bar and not the food.
- No room service available after 10pm. We were caught out by this one night and ordered a Dominos. 
- Rooms are very small.
- Aircon kept giving me some minor sinus issues in the morning which is a first for me at any hotel.

Overall:
Very pleased with the stay.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/ba/74/f2/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg","2013-03-31","2013-04-08","2013-04-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r157091712-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Good bathroom (large walk in shower not bath). Good soundproofing/blackout curtains.  Some negatives - hotels seemed pristine throughout but room had a squatted spider on wall and some sticky patches on carpet (I sense these were exceptions rather than rule to hotel cleanliness); constant low level buzzing from bathroon extractor could be heard all night (sadly a common feature of modern hotels).  Breakfast (good value at 7.95 offered on check out not at 13.50 standard) was good with food being constantly replenished by efficient staff (although promised croissants never arrived) but very busy with mainly large groups of what I assumed to be hen parties (again sensed our problem bad timing so exception rather than rule).

Sleep Quality: 5","Excellent Hotel whether you're on business, trip away, or stag do!","I've stayed in Hilton's a few times, and they've always consistently been good hotels. They're unlikely to be the cheapest, but when they come to value you get bang for your buck, and it is really the little as well as big things Hilton Hotels do so well. 

We stayed over the Easter Weekend for a Stag Do, sensibly (though we aren't a rowdy bunch) they put us on the 1st floor so we would only disturb ourselves when coming back in the early hours. The hotel is very central for the station if you opt for the train, or if you wish to drive they have a 50 space carpark £10 for 24hrs. The hotel is only about a 10 minute walk into the city centre and nearby shopping centre. 

On arrival we were quickly checked in by a cheery receptionist and give our room keys, my room was a decent size and nice and quiet, the bed was very comfy. A nice little touch is having an iMac in your room, meaning you can go on the net, play music, or watch TV and it's all included in the room price. The bathroom was a decent size, though only had a shower rather than bath, the water was hot I would have preferred a more powerful shower but it was adequate enough, obviously too used to power showers! Curtains were good quality blackout ones as well, which I always find good so you're able to get a quality nights sleep, another good thing which I find I can't always get right in the room is the room temperature. I like a cool room and here that wasn't a problem.  

We had a number of heavy nights and don't like to get up very early, a real win with The Hilton is the fact that on the weekend and bank holidays breakfast runs till midday. This is very rare for most hotels, normally running breakfast till around 10. The selection and food was excellent, from a full English to continental, fresh fruit, yoghurt, pastries, there really is something for everyone, and plenty of it. Should you want an omelette or salmon then all you do is ask your waiter or waitress and they will send your order to the kitchen to cook fresh. I had the salmon one day which was very nice. 

All in all it was an enjoyable stay, and I'd recommend it to everyone apart from maybe a romantic trip away where a boutique hotel maybe more suitable.","0","","2013-04-30","2013-04-03","2013-04-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r156531292-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Hotel is a few minutes walk from Temple Meads station and no more than ten minutes walk into city centre. Check in was fast friendly and efficient. Room was fine - garden view meaning they look over the old Temple church and gardens rather than he busy main road.

Bathrooms are very small with only a shower. Bed ok but if you don't like them hard you probably won't like it. Wifi worked fine. Imac in room OK but regular TV would have probably been more welcome.

Breakfast is great and all the staff fantastic. Good buffet plus several other items available to order. 

There is a fitness room but I didnt check this out.

Now the problem...  Friday night was wonderfully quiet and peaceful.... Saturday a hen do checked in to the rooms in the corridor. To summarise politely, they weren't a very well brought up bunch whose behaviour was unacceptable. Coupled with two rooms being occupied by some clubbers who kept playing loud music and thinking it hilarious to knock on all the doors with do not disturb on, it was destined to be a rubbish night's sleep. Obviously when the ignorant members of the hen party returned in the early hours, they continued to shout swear and bang doors for the next hour or so.

Reception did tell the music players to turn the music down. But hotel staff when an obviously drunken noisy grop return in the middle of the night need to be proactive and monitor them. 

The hotel can't be responsible for guests behaviour but they have a duty of care to the majority of guests who have often paid a lot of money and who do behave like adults. Hilton must have known that this was a hen party booking. At breakfast the next morning there were also some men from a stag party so it seems policy to accept this downmarket clientele

Such a shame as it ruins the rest of the hotel and the good work done by most of the staff

At least Premier Inn guarantee a good nights sleep so you could get your money back with them

Don't stay here if you want to have a good night's sleep!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/bf/ef/a8/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg","2013-03-31","2013-03-26","2013-03-26","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r155749249-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Our Room was clean an comfortable. It had all the usual features you'd expect in a medium quality upmarket hotel suite. Walk in shower, comfortable bed, Our room over looked the old Bristol abbey rather than the main road out front. 

One novel feature was a MAC instead of a TV in the room. It took a while to get used to if your a PC sort of person like me.

A good thing for me  was the room had its own fridge., So we bought some wine and nibbles and was able to keep them cool in the room.  

The hotel has its own car park, But you have to pay £10 a night for it's use. I feel this should be provided free to hotel patrons. Parking in Bristol is at a premium, so a hotel with its own car park is a bonus.

Would stay there again if visiting the city.","0","","2013-03-31","2013-03-26","2013-03-26","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r155688223-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

However, the weekend was marred for us because of the air-conditioning & extractor fan in the bathroom. We were originally upgraded to a 5th floor room that was over-looking the park, however it was like sleeping on a noisy ferry. The fan in the bathroom did not turn off atall, and the air-conditioning units on the roof made a continual hum. About midnight we had to ask to move rooms as the staff couldn't turn off the fan in the bathroom. However the room we were moved to on the 3rd floor had exactly the same problem - the bathroom extractor fan ran constantly!
We resorted to buying earplugs for the 2nd night!
Other than that the rooms were nice, although not sure why they have so many chairs in them when they are such small rooms? The air-conditioning didn't seem to heat the room, although the weather is exceptionally cold at the moment.
The breakfast was great - I loved the waffles, making them fresh is a delcious way to start the day.","0","","2013-03-31","2013-03-24","2013-03-24","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r155503998-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Very happy overall - just small improvements suggested to get to 'Excellent'.","0","","2013-03-31","2013-03-23","2013-03-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r155393515-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The staff, firstly let me say that the Receptionist Annie is an absolute godsend, efficient, polite, knowledgable and helpful a real credit to the hotel and the Hilton chain.
The staff on duty on Monday 18th and Tuesday 19th (reception, bar and restaurant)  were excellent, the food was well cooked and tasty.
The staff on Wednesday were .... erm.... average except for the afore mentioned Annie, Breakfast just seemed dis-organised and the food was not a patch on Tuesday's. Checking out was a bit of a trial when trying to get my company's name on the bill.
Overall a recommended Hotel and perfectly placed just off the city centre but close enough to walk and would qualify for 5 out 5 if not for the inconsistent staff.","0","","2013-03-31","2013-03-21","2013-03-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r155268352-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is only a short walk from Temple Meads Railway Station and looks to be in an area surrounded by offices. Check-in was smooth and we were allocated a room on the fifth floor, which was compact but it was more than we needed for our weekend break. An added bonus was the good quality toiletries that were supplied. 

Breakfast was a bit frantic as the hotel appeared to be really busy, but there was plenty to eat and we left for a day out in Bath with a good cooked breakfast to set us up for the day. The hotel may be surrounded by offices but within about a 500 metre radius there are at least four great real ale pubs which was a nice bonus. 

The hotel provided good quality accommodation at a reasonable price, what more can you ask for?","0","","2013-03-31","2013-03-20","2013-03-20","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r155189140-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It's a budget style operation - decent rates, modest size rooms, tiny bathroom etc. But where it scores extra points is that it is clean, modern, extremely comy beds, and the staff seem genuinely interested in helping out. And the computers in each room are a brilliant touch which other hotels really ought to follow - it gives you TV, radio etc but with free internet access too. 

The bits that are a let down are really quire minor and not exactly worth worrying about in the great scheme of things. Some wear and tear was evident - bulb out, bare wire on the PC mouse cable etc. Annoyingly the aircon diagram on the wall didnt match the controls which made things confusing. 

A tasty buffet breakfast, efficient service. But sadly it was lukewarm due to a combination of cold plates and the food itself being kept below an ideal temperature. Great shame because it was jolly tasty fare. Nice touch was the eggs fired to order whilst you wait. 

In all I'd happily stay again and would feel pleased if my company books me here.","0","","2013-03-31","2013-03-13","2013-03-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r154462697-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I ended up having to park, like some other guests on yellow hashed areas parked for delivery.  The spaces are tiny in the main bays and the person arriving in a minibus would of had no chance.  

The downside to this, is a £10 overnight parking fee.  This I feel isn't acceptable when the car park isn't secure, unlike their competitor the Holiday Inn just up the road which charge less and have security gates.

Check in was swift and polite, but there was no information on breakfast or the times it operated.  

My room at first appeared great, however a quick freshen up in the bathroom changed that.  I noticed the bathroom door had a big hand print on the door in what looked like blood.  It might of been make up, but the colour looked odd.  I was given a new room without question, although I had only expected somebody to come and clean it.

The room fixtures and fittings were all excellent.  The fridge, iMAC, JBL Sound System, Iron & Board, all above and beyond most hotels.  Bed excellent and my second room spotlessly clean.

The breakfast next morning was served until 12 as it happens, but this is what stops me rating the hotel with 5 points.  I was seated and served coffee then left, no explanation of help yourself etc.  The table had a menu which said to order from your server, who never came back.  Being vegetarian and wanting to order from the card I went back to the door and spoke to the lady there and requested some items.  I went to the self serve too, but plates were not to be seen, eventually found on a shelf under it.  The selections were very meat heavy, no signs of any mushrooms or hash browns which is unusual.  The toaster just produced a lot of smoke but didn't toast, nobody could seem to get anything other than warm bread out of it.  The fruit bar was practically empty.  The cook to order chef had vanished just leaving a frying pan on the ring and wasn't seen.    I had to ask a second time for my vegetarian order which then suddenly appeared announced very loudly and abrupt  - but to the wrong table.   I wasn't offered any further coffee or too see if everything was ok.     This was a complete let down.

Overall:  Poor breakfast - Poor Parking 

For £75 one night B&B+Parking they really need to raise their game as it didn't stack up as good value.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/98/2e/c8/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

Sleep Quality: 4","Bristol Hotel - Good stay but could be better","We stayed at the Garden  Inn for 2 nights in early March. It is well located for central Bristol, close to the waterfront and in easy walking distance of everything in the centre. Staff are pleasant and welcoming and the bedroom on the top floor was spotless. While overlooking the dull dual carriageway it was quiet and no noise carried. It had 8 hangers in the wardrobe - an area so many hotels pay little attention to, an imac, and free wifi without any connectivity details required. All of this made a very good first impression  The toilet was a bit small, but hardly a complaint.

What let the hotel down in our view was breakfast and parking.  Let's start with the latter. when we arrived on Friday we nabbed the last place outside the hotel in the electronic barrier controlled parking and that was fine. The charge is £10 for 24 hours which seemed perfectly reasonable. On our second day in Bristol we took our car and returned at 5pm when there were no spaces and we parked on the street. We went out again across town, and on return at 11 p.m. there were still no spaces and we parked for free on the deserted street one block away and did not feel comfortable leaving our car in that area. The hotel has inadequate parking facilities.     

Breakfast is not good. Inadequate facilities for number of guests - scrambled eggs were cold as last portion- when they ran out there was no replacement. Choice of bread is white sliced or brown sliced.  Best not to dwell on it, but in comparison to the other Hiltons at which we have stayed this was a huge disappointment. We would recommend not paying for this meal.","1","","2013-03-31","2013-03-03","2013-03-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r153634675-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

On arrival at the hotel the reception staff were very helpful. The room we stayed in was small but what you expect for a city centre hotel. The room was spotlessly clean and beautifully maintained and had everything you need for a perfect weekend away. We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening as we had made other plans but if the restaurant was to be judged by the standard of the breakfast then it would get a 10/10 from me. The staff at breakfast were exceptionally helpful and went the extra mile. We will definitely return.

The hotel is clearly geared up for business travellers.  The three rooms I stayed in were virtually identical. The differences were: one was the mirror image of the other two; one had a much larger bedside table - useful if you want to keep a drink of water by the bed - this one (on the fifth floor) also had decent sized mugs, unlike the other two where the mugs were really only cup-sized.

A good range of toiletries was provided: soap; shower gel; shampoo; conditioner; body lotion; mouthwash; shower cap; vanity kit; flannel. The bath towel was a generous size - unusual for a hotel where in my experience you normally only get a minimum sized fairly scratchy towel - these were large and soft. Everything I used was replaced next day - similarly the tea, coffee and milk.

The air conditioning was efficient, although I only needed to adjust it on one or two days. 

The best thing in the room was the iMac - with free internet access and several TV and radio channels, this was a really welcome touch.

The restaurant was probably the most disappointing aspect with a very limited menu - one evening there was no vegetarian main course and when I pointed this out was offered one of the starters as a main. I'm not sure what I would have had as a starter! I had the cheese board instead, which was fine. 

Breakfast offered a good choice, however the service was not always very efficient. As well as the range of items on the buffet it was possible to order freshly cooked eggs, porridge, vegetarian sausages and smoked salmon.  Several times I witnessed the ordered items being delivered to the wrong table and people waiting for quite some time for their food to arrive as a result. Tea was brought to the tables but on occasions was extremely weak. There were also flasks of tea and coffee available but unfortunately tea from the flask tasted of coffee. I'm surprised nobody has realised that you can't use a flask previously used for coffee for much else as it taints whatever it is used for.

While we were there it was Pancake day but there were no pancakes on the menu - not even for breakfast, and though we asked for them, were refused. There was, however, free birthday cake on the hotel's birthday!

Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel as there are plenty of restaurants nearby in Cabot Circus and it's also walking distance from Za Za Bazaar, where you can eat as much as you like for £15. The hotel is also very convenient for Temple Meads station.","2","","2013-02-28","2013-02-24","2013-02-24","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r152982807-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

A good location near the town centre, but quiet rooms at the back of the hotel. All day parking (extra cost but reasonable), very friendly welcoming reception, and waitress at breakfast.

Check-In, Check-in was easy, simple and efficient. A friend was sharing the twin room and on her arrival my wife was notified straight away by the receptionist and was asked if it was ok for her friend to be sent up to the room. My wife felt that this was excellent security measure as the reception had clearly noted my wife was travelling alone. Top marks to Hilton for this.

Room, Clean and comfortable, and the shower was nice and hot. Another notable feature of the room was a fully functioning Apple Mac PC which was also the TV!! Also is we have stayed in Hilton hotels before, my wife did not have to re-register to join the WIFI network. Top marks for that.

Food, Did not have evening meal but made use of the Pantry service after our night out. Breakfast was excellent although the toaster was not working, but it not effect the breakfast as she did not eat any.

Overall, An excellent hotel for weekends and business travellers due to it's location in the city. One downside is the size of the car park for the hotel. This is very small and not big enough for the hotel and the number of customers it serves and they charge you £10 to boot. There is street parking nearby but it only free from 18:00 Saturdays. Overall it was a decent stay for £69.00 per room including breakfast.","0","","2013-02-28","2013-02-18","2013-02-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r152459064-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Check in went smoothly,then off to the room which was Excellent very bright and i would think very new going off the apperence i was in a twin room there was plenty of room to move around.
there was a wardrobe a small fridge which had probably been a mini  bar at some time, above that in the same cupboard was a electronic safe there was a desk/working surface where there was a apple mac tv a key board and external speakers.OH AND THE WIFI IS FREE, unlike the Hilton at Newport i had stayed in the previous night where they charged "" £14.99 per night)
Back to the room at the desk/workstation was a very comfertable computer chair,there was a good quality deep pile carpet, the beds where comfertable with good quality mattresses that were'nt too soft,on the bedside table was a radio alarm what a nice touch the radio that is as it had buttons on the top marked rock, pop,classical country easy listening and others, so you don't have to mess around tuning into specific stations.
The bathroom bright with plenty of light plenty of complementry toiletries and towels and a good sized shower, in a cupboard just before the bathroom was an iron and ironing board, also in one of the draws was a hairdryer..everything you need in the room i say it again EXCELLENT !
I ate in the restaraunt after a trawl around Bristol city centre looking for a indian restaraunt.
The staff were very helpful they squezed me in even though they were full.i had home made carrot and ginger soup to start accompanied with a slice of fresh bloomer bread and very tastey it was too my main course i went for chicken with leek mash and green beans the chicken was superb very succulant and the mash lovely and greenbeans very tastey all accompanied with a jus. after the main course i asked one of the waitresses if i could have a cheese board and did it come with brie on she said it did when i told her i do not like brie she said she would exchange it for a cheese that i prefered. now that is what i call good service.","1","","2013-02-28","2013-02-09","2013-02-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r151717383-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It is very well located near to Temple Meads station and only 20 minutes walk away from the harbourside .

The Imac TVs were a real bonus .

I was only disappointed as there were unable to offer firm pillows and as such I didn't sleep well either night . It was a pity that the first person I asked didn't let me know at the time or even get back to me as I would have gone out and brought some from a shop !! It was only when I went down at 11pm to find out where they were I was told they couldn't provide any .

This hotel is in a great location just a few minutes from Bristol Temple Meads railway station and Cardiff is only an hour away on the train. It's also a 10 minute walk to the centre of Bristol. 

The hotel staff were just great, nothing was too much trouble and the girl working the breakfast buffet on the Saturday morning of the match had her work cut out for her as the breakfast restaurant was very busy but she handled it all in her stride and with a smile and great service.

The rooms are small but comfortable however my partner didn't sleep too well as the bed was a bit hard and the pillows not the most comfortable.

All in all this is a good hotel ideally located for Cardiff and Bristol town centre.","0","","2013-02-28","2013-02-05","2013-02-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r151446009-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

As I use Macs for work, I was glad that I didn't have to pack my computer but could use the one in the room instead. Rooms are small but perfectly formed with everything you need. 

The only downside was the group of idiot lads who were staying opposite our room and stank the corridor out with their nasty Lynx aftershave and BO, then woke us up at 2am and again at 4am as they were shouting outside our room and started hammering on our door (presumably as we had a Do Not Disturb sign hanging up they thought this was hilarious...) As two young women staying in the room, we didn't find this as amusing as they did and asked to be moved the next day, which we were, further down the corridor. 

Whilst we were happy with the new room, the whole experience did kind of put us off. As we were still on the same floor, we worried what high jinks our neighbours would get up to the next night and bought earplugs just in case. We hadn't really thought that this hotel was the kind of place that attracted stag parties, but I guess the cheap price will do that! However, the second night we were able to sleep soundly though we were greeted the next morning by one of the lads strolling around the corridor with no shirt on like he was in Magaluf and not Bristol! 

Breakfast on both mornings was great and we got a free glass of wine each on one night as we signed up for the Hilton Honours program. Customer service was great - all the people on reception were very polite and helpful. 

Overall, I would definitely stay here again for a girly weekend, but I would check in future that I'm not going to be in a room surrounded by chavvy delinquents whose idea of a 'wild night in Bristol' was going to Gala bingo... I kid you not...

Room was very comfortable - ask for one at the back overlooking the church if you like peace and quiet.  Free wifi.  Good bed, two chairs, desk and a combined TV, DVD player and computer.

The staff were very friendly and efficient.  A model other hotels could do well to emulate.

The standard of food was extremely high.  Breakfast excellent - either cooked food from the buffet or cooked to order.  Can recommend the scrambled egg on muffin with smoked salmon.

Similarly dinner. Good quality ingredients extremely well presented and cooked.  We had the set menu both nights due to the deal we were on - though still excellent value at £17 on Friday and £19 on Saturday for three courses if booked separately.  Only slight disappointment was that the menu was virtually the same on both nights, though there was plenty of choice so did not need to eat the same thing twice.

Not too keen on being asked to sign an itemised bill after dinner when on DBB with the optional tip box left to fill in - smacks of touting for tips. I may be old fashioned, but do not think that eating in an English hotel should attract a service charge if you are a guest - but realise that this happens abroad.  Unfortunately this practice is starting to creep into the UK.","3","","2013-01-31","2013-01-29","2013-01-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r150943058-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Hilton Garden Inns never disappoint with friendly staff, immaculate rooms and public spaces. Nothing is ever a problem whether it's checking in at 9.15am or leaving luggage in storage until ready to head home. As others have stated, the hotel makes an ideal base for visitors being situated close to Temple Meads railway station, which is also where the airport 'Flyer' bus service drops off and picks up. Barely five minutes walking distance from the attraction rich harbour, the hotel is close enough to the Cabot Circus and Broadmeads shopping centres for there to be no need for buses or taxis and as the whole town is pretty much on one level, people with mobility issues should have no problems. On that subject, more mature guests will find the beds especially comfortable and easy to get out of as they have high bases and lovely deep mattresses. They really think of everything from complimentary sewing kits, designer toiletries, free wifi, a Mac pc with JBL surround sound system and a good strong shower. Never ate at the hotel but overheard several business guests praising the food (albeit at a price)! Finally, at no point during our weekend stay did we feel threatened or uncomfortable anywhere - the west country folk are friendly and considerate, so have no misgivings about walking late at night. A memorable stay for all the right reasons.","2","","2013-01-31","2013-01-27","2013-01-27","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r150775835-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The interesting thing was that the TV was Apple and could be used as a PC.  No instructions on how to operate this and as the visual depiction of the tiny handset seemed different from the reality, it took some time for us oldies to get online.  The breakfast is sumptuous; with everything from cereal to fruit and yogurt in ample supply.  Then of course there is a supurb hot breakfast with saugages, bacon,eggs, beans, tomatoes and mushrooms.  Add to this loads of tea,coffee and toast and you'll be spoilt for choice. The restaurant staff were willling to fulfil any food requests ,i.e. hot milk for the coffee. On Sunday morning a nice touch was hot waffles with usual accompaniments. The only difficulty was that we could not get our little room fridge to work and didn't have the energy to find out why. The staff at Hilton Garden are welcoming and very friendly.

Bristol is a very historical city and has many restaurants but I did not like the night life much.Oceana did not seem to have a good atmosphere.Pitcher and piano was nice to have a few quiet drinks and the weatherspoons by the habourside was very cheap of-course but I felt the night life wasn't good.The kebabs were very nice though and generous amounts given too.If I was to go to Bristol again,I would make sure I planned it out better as it is very easy to get lost.I would definitely stay in this hotel again but I wouldn't go to Bristol again,although I had an amazing time still.There is a £10 charge for parking too and we were allowed to check in almost 2.5 hrs early too.","1","","2013-01-31","2013-01-13","2013-01-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r149603629-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

This hotel is so central for so many things - would definitely stay there again","0","","2012-12-31","2013-01-10","2013-01-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r149370779-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is just 7-10 minute walk into Cabots Circus (fantastic shopping mall).
The breakfast was delicious..
We had a slight problem with the breakfast one day, but Olpie at the Reception dealt with the matter instantly and were shocked at the amazing service received...thank-you!!
I have knocked off one star as the room sizes are pretty small and feels slightly claustrophobic after a while. We asked if we could have a room with a bath tub, but none of the rooms had a bath tub. 

Overall, had a lovely stay! Thank-you!","0","","2012-12-31","2013-01-06","2013-01-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r149005777-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Only one flaw, but a key point.","Decided to stay here for one night as we found a good deal through trivago (Queen Evolution room with park view for £53!) and even though I completely forgot to put the postcode into my GPS, I wouldn't have needed to anyway as its location is off the main route past Cabot circus and you can't miss it. 

Check in was fast and the staff were very kind, you are even allowed to order takeaway and get it sent to your room with no noses turned up. 

Room was large, clean, good selection of neutrogena products and my favourite... A power shower, always the perfect start to the day. Unfortunately both me and the person I was with said the same thing, the room was hot and the bed wasn't overly comfortable so it wasn't the best night sleep. Nevertheless the room came with a 22"" iMac with JBL speakers and sub, tea and coffee, safe, minibar and an ice bucket depending on what you might be there for ;)

I would probably stay here again for the value as its a prime location for a weekend shopping.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/4c/48/d3/22-imac.jpg

The room was clean and functional, all we needed for a night's stay! There was an empty fridge to store drinks etc. Breakfast was great, with bucks fizz available to toast the new year! I enjoyed fresh fruit and a full english breakfast, with good quality sausage and bacon. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend for a stay in the city.

Picked the advance purchase rate which is quite good offer, unfortunately I made a little mistake of the booking- was supposed to choose the double bed room/not a twin beds room. The prices of both room types are exactly the same on Booking.com. Due to it's a booking based on advance purchase rate, I can’t amend it under my account myself. Reasonably, I thought I could ring the hotel directly to ask this little tiny favour. However, the girl (India Accent) in front desk kept persuades me to ring Booking.com directly and then she just hanged up the phone without waiting for me to finish the conversation!!!!!! How a staff under HILTON brand can do things like that?!!!!! I have been traveling a lot and stayed in all sort of hotels and never met experience like that, plus that was a tiny favour! I didn’t expect to cancel the booking!! I tired to ring back again and spoke to a girl in the reservation the second time, luckily not all the staffs are  with non-customer service sense. She kindly sorted all the problems for me and sent me another booking confirmation letter! What I would like to say is, if you really want to provide guests a good stay, please watch how your staff talk to us, please!!

It did turn out that the area around the hotel has several budget chain hotels, office buildings and university buildings. Not the most exciting area during the weekend. But luckily the city centre and old town as well as several malls and Christmas markets were within fair walking distance from the hotel.

The hotel itself was quite nice and very well lit. We felt very welcome upon entering the hotel and had no problems finding our way. Our room was on the 4th floor and although it was quite small, with a small bathroom as well, we got by quite well during our stay.

It was nice to have free Wi-Fi and even an iMac which didn't just serve as the rooms TV and radio but also made it possible to surf the web and even watch movies on Netflix. Nice.

The room also had a small fridge, perfect for keeping our store bought breakfast items and drinks cold.

We found the room clean and the surroundings were fairly quiet. The view from our room was also pretty nice as well.

We had a nice time at this hotel, and in the city, and would consider staying here again in the future.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/41/fb/ba/hilton-garden-inn-bristol.jpg

I arrived at the hotel at around 8pm, and the night manager was incredibly helpful. My interview was in a rather obscure location, so she helped by pointing out were it was and sorting out a taxi for the next day. My mother came with me for shopping and the night manager kindly marked out some good sights and shops for my mum to visit whilst I was at the interview.

We then asked for a good restaurant recommendation - and we were sent to a beautiful Italian 5 minutes away.

The room was lovely, it was good to have use of the Mac as a computer particularly before interview. It was a little small perhaps, and there was no bath, but this hotel is such great value for money. The bed I thought was comfy, but can see here than a few have remarked it was uncomfortable.

Ate in the bar for lunch after my interview and it was very nice, if a little overpriced, but it is a hotel bar - no surprises there.

All in all, I enjoyed my stay and was impressed by the price, good location and most of all the helpful and friendly manner of the staff.","0","","2012-11-30","2012-12-20","2012-12-20","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r147782351-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The staff offer fantastic customer service, the rooms are small but very well equipped with large screen Apple Macs in every room and free internet and wifi connection.  My room  was very clean and tripple glazed and I wasn't disturbed by noise from outside at any time.  It is convenient to fabulous restaurants but my surprise was the standard of food being served in the hotel.  I had breakfast, served with a smile from all the waiting staff and a bar snack which was more excellent than a 5 star ""gaff"" I stayed in a few weeks ago.  The Christmas dinner menu looked like fantastic value at £15.00 for two or three courses and I can recommend the festive pudding - delicious.  I will definitely stay in the hotel again and would miss the opportunity the next time of dining there too.  If you are big on customer service and a ""foodie"" like me then you will not be disappointed with this hotel.","0","","2012-12-31","2012-12-10","2012-12-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r147107257-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Great location as its easy walking distance to all the excellent shopping venues in the city and close to the harbour side for dining in the evening.  Couldn't fault the hotel everything we wanted and more.  Parking right outside the door, easy check in and good size room with lots of extras including Apple TV with computer facilities for free.  Breakfast was of a very good standard and freshly cooked selection until 11am. Most of all this establishment should be so proud of their staff as everyone was so polite and helpful and they smile!!  Top marks must go to Mark on reception, when checking in my daughter mentioned it was a birthday celebration trip and he promptly organised a special delivery to the room from the hotel.. Bottle of chilled wine and chocolate bars, what a lovely surprise when I opened the door!!  Mark also spend some considerable time explaining the different venues near the harbour side and the best way to get to them providing us with a map also.  This won't be the last time we stay here we had what can only be described as a super stay.","0","","2012-12-31","2012-12-09","2012-12-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r147078897-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We weren't able to check in early due to a shortage of linen (!) but we were able to leave our bags. When we returned later in the afternoon there were fresh cookies available, the staff were welcoming and they recognised that it was my mother's birthday and sent 2 glasses of prosecco to out room which we were very pleased with.
Breakfast was a bit disorganised, no chamomile tea available and a limited selection of cold breakfast options. They kept running out of bowls and plates too but the staff were helpful and apologetic. 
We slept very well and would recommend staying at this hotel. Very convenient for exploring Bath which is 15-20 minutes away on the train and close to the shops as well.

(£64 per room including breakfast for myself and my husband). Asked for quiet room, was on top(5th) floor looking over churchyard, brilliant. En suite shower room (no bath) was a bit small, but it had everything that you required and loads of hot water from the shower. The room was clean had everything you needed, hairdryer, iron, ironing board, alarm, tv, tea/coffe facilities. As a previous guest said the bed was firm, but l had a good nights sleep and no aching back so l can't complain. There were a few marks on carpet and walls from previous guests but nothing too bad.
The staff were all helpful, and the breakfasts good, especially the sausages, they were the best l've ever had (I wish l had asked where they got them from), Only ate in the hotel one evening and it was a good 3 course meal for £20.
We went by train and it is really convienient for the station, especially as we went on the train to Bath for the Christmas markets. Also not too far to walk to all the other attractions in Bristol. Would definitely recommend and if we go to Bristol again we will definitely stay at this hotel again.","0","","2012-11-30","2012-11-28","2012-11-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r146379587-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I really liked the Nutrogena complimentary products provided, down to the flannel I forgot to bring
On the street side but with triple glazed windows I didnt hear a thing.
Everything was clean and new, I guess there has been a refurb in the last year or so.
The only worrying thing was returning to the hotel after a course I was in the bar and purchased with a colleague some overpriced drinks. These were bought and paid for in cash and when we left the bar and travelled down the corridor towards our rooms on the second floor we were chased by a member of staff as he thought we had left without paying our bar bill.... strange as I would have thought if we were on a tab a room number would have been taken? I mean do we look the sort???
Breakfast the next morning was a sort of serve yourself, as in there was a waiter poised with coffee for top ups, but he seemed to ignore us ladies and only applied himself to older businessmen...perhaps they tip better as we certainly didnt when faced with being ignored!
I also must say the cleaning staff were lovely, I let them know my room was vacant when I left and the housekeeper went out of her way to hold the door open for me and my bags
It was definately a case of the female staff were lovely but the male staff had a lot to learn
Room service was strange as you chose and heat up your own food from a sort of minimart in the reception area as far as I could tell - not tested","0","","2012-11-30","2012-11-28","2012-11-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r146363378-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The cleaning staff were all very friendly and chirpy, the reception staff were professional and very helpful (especially Opie) We were a little disappointed that there was only a Christmas menu available in the restaurant on Sunday night, but the waitress very helpfully suggested another restaurant off site. The parking is a bit expensive at £10 a day but city centre car parking would have cost a lot more, so I am not complaining. I found the bed a little too firm but my friends all thought they were very comfortable so each to their own! We liked the mac in the room, a useful touch if you are travelling without a laptop. Despite the proximity to a busy road there was very little noise. This hotel really does offer everything you need at a very reasonable price. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending it.

In terms of food we had room service on the first night as we arrived late (good standard burger was £12 plus £4 surcharge room delivery) and the other we came across a wetherspoons pub situated on Temple Quay when walking from the train station to the hotel that took less than 10 minutes to achieve.

Room was great, clean and very comfortable with excellent fascilities.  Sadly it all went downhill from there.  The bar had 4 draft beers, none of which were available.  To make matters worse, the 2 bottled beers available were not refrigerated and hugely overpriced at nearly £9 for 2 warm beers!  Restaurant staff were surly and unlike other dinners, didn't think that we warranted any communication throuout our meal, not so much as a ""is your meal ok""?  Proably best as it wasn't great, overcooked and overpriced.  Overall, this hotel let the Hilton brand down.

Food was expensive and portions small in the restaurant, with any nice touches being charged as extras.

Overall, I would have a difficult time recommending this hotel.","0","","2012-11-30","2012-11-18","2012-11-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r145677754-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The Macs in the rooms are excellent and, although rooms are small, they have all the facilities you would expect and are comfortable and reasonable value, especially if they include free WIFI.  Unfortunately, in common with an increasing number of Hiltons I've stayed in lately, where the Garden Inn falls down is staff complacency. They don't have to try too hard - and they don't.  The reception staff didn't engage in any conversation when I arrived; they didn't ask about newspapers, say where the restaurant was, mention breakfast hours, or say that guests had to collect water from a refrigerator in reception.  In fact the only thing they did ask was whether I had parked in the hotel car park.  I had to find out everything else myself.  Being employed in customer care I could have done better! The restaurant was full in the evening but the bar was offered as an alternative.  The 'salad' advertised with the meal turned out to be a small portion of lettuce. Breakfast was average, with smaller selection available than many other Hiltons, although you could order poached eggs, porridge etc.  I was surprised that you had even had to order a fried egg. The dining room had food on the floor, which wasn't swept up, and the serving spoons were all completely cloyed with mixed beans, egg etc - not appetising! - and this was over an hour before the end of the breakfast period. A bin was situated by the serving area. There was no tea or coffee offered and only an occasional glimpse of waiting staff.  More than one person had to ask for a drink before someone came to serve and when some staff did appear they seemed more interested in spritzing the tables.  Again, when I left, I was asked if I had used the car park, but I wasn't asked if I had enjoyed my stay.  I asked if it was possible to have an itemised restaurant bill but received no reply and no itemised bill. Unlikely to stay here again as there are plenty of other hotels in Bristol.","0","","2012-11-30","2012-11-09","2012-11-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r145039749-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I had a room with breakfast included and found it to be a good value and while it was crowded in the morning I had no trouble getting enough food and getting served coffee and tea.

This hotel is convenient to the train station though it is a little further from the 'center' of town than some other possible choices.  We were still able to walk to the center and to the University within 20-30 min. and the hotel is by no means isolated.

If I had one gripe it was that the elevators did not work the day we left and we had to climb down several flights with luggage.  There didn't seem to be any urgency in getting it repaired.","0","","2012-10-31","2012-11-02","2012-11-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r144335162-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Our room was small but very well equipped and we were very impressed with the iMac computer/TV! The shower did seem to have a bit of a mind of it's own but the shower room was very well equipped - certainly a cut above your usual 'budget' hotel chains.

Probably better suited to 20/30's crowd as there was a lot of noise on the Saturday night into the early hours when we returned to the hotel from a night out.

The hotel is a little way out of the town centre, if you are intending on a night out I would suggest that you will need a taxi of which there are plenty in the area.","0","","2012-10-31","2012-10-30","2012-10-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r144096572-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Breakfast was particularly good as not only a good English breakfast (yes there are beans!) but good selection of fruit and the best part for me, the waffle maker and the addition of maple syrup or chocolate sauce (don't think about the calories at breakfast, you can't miss out!). The staff here are really hard working and actually seemed to enjoy looking after us! Car parking is at hotel £10 but was full so behind hotel is a pay and display 4 hours stay £4 which you only need pay until 6 p.m. and then revisit in the morning. Check out was 11 and ok to check out and then go for breakfast. Have a little walk through the church yard and stop for a drink at the King's Head a wonderful bit of our English history!

Upon arrival I was disappointed with the tiny car park. It has maybe 25 spaces for a 175 room hotel. To make matters worse the spaces are incredibly small and really tight to get in. If you have a large car I would avoid the hotel car park and look for an alternate place to leave your car. 

The hotel is easy to find by car, and 5-10 minutes walk from the main shopping quarter. There are also plenty of chain restaurants or bars nearby.

However after checking in and getting into our room we were pleasantly surprised. The room was not the biggest but more than functional. The furniture was solid and well made but the jewel in the crown was the iMac computer which doubles as the TV, radio and CD player. Of course you could also use it as a computer and there is free Internet access, both on the mac and wifi in the room. Not the fastest in the world but still free.

The bathroom again was slightly on the small side but easily comfortable with a decent shower (no bath).

Our room was facing a main room, and we had absolutely no trouble with any noise.

We would have no hesitation on staying at the Hilton Bristol again. £89 (inc parking) for a 4 star hotel is a bargin.","1","","2012-10-31","2012-10-07","2012-10-07","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r142231384-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Comfortable bed and the location is as good as ever, but I'll be looking for somewhere else next time I stay in Bristol.","0","","2012-10-31","2012-10-07","2012-10-07","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r142203680-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I stayed on a room facing the park(at the backside) and it was very calm and quiet. I am not sure about the front facing rooms as they overlook the road, but looks like almost all rooms are acoustically sealed :) 

The rooms are a tad smaller than the ones that i stayed in the neigbouring Novotel, but it was VERY clean and service was good. Also, since there was no complimentary breakfast, it helped me in choosing me what i wanted to eat on a daily basis than eating the same menu all throughout my stay. 

The gym was a little smaller than what i would have expected; but nevertheless it has all the basic equipments. Would have better if there was a sauna or a swimming pool :)","0","","2012-09-30","2012-09-28","2012-09-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r141483677-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The first thing which we loved about this hotel was the location, we were approximately 5 minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads train station and 5-10 minutes walk from the city centre (Cabotts Circus), if your looking at visiting Bristol docks then we recommend that you get a taxi (approx. £5-£7) the hotels reception did this for us! (Very helpful). Our room was fabulous, the bed was very compfy and the cushions were to die for! Another thing which was great was they had an Apple I Mac which was a TV & Computer, so its ideal if you do not know the area, the hotel soo clean and the hotel staff were all lovely. The breakfest was okay you have a selection from cooked breakfest and continental breakfest and you can help yourself as much as you like, however we did see that if you were to purchase breakfest as an extra it was £14! Which we thought was astonishing for what their was (highly recommend booking a room which includes breakfest). All in all we really enjoyed our stay and would go back again!","0","","2012-09-30","2012-09-23","2012-09-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r141019985-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The restaurant used to be excellent and there was ample free car parking and the rooms were reasonably priced. My company booked me into this place again and I discovered that it has fallen into the hands of Hilton. Oh dear. To be fair, the staff were very polite and helpful so no criticism of them at all. However, what was an excellent hotel has sunk into expensive mediocrity since Hilton took over. Hilton is a tired brand which runs tired hotels, fails to invest in them, takes too much of your money and delivers very little. The walls are marked, the carpets stained by what looks like bleach.

Check in took far too long (as did checkout), the decor looks tired now (it didn't when I stayed here last year when it was the MINT), they charge £10 to park there when it used to be free, the restaurant has changed from an excellent eatery into an expensive and poor quality experience. I ordered pork, apple and black pudding (at £14). It was served on a huge plate but the portion was tiny: 2 mouthfuls, and dry and overcooked at that. It wasn't black pudding, it was white pudding. Hilton serves wine in thimbles, not glasses although they charge as if you've ordered a 250ml glass. Sorry, but I felt seriously ripped off. Breakfast is the usual cereal and full English: boring, boring, boring (and expensive). For £14 I'd expect some imagination and variety. You'd get better value from a Premier Inn, and for a lot less money than I had to pay.

The rooms are small: no change there, but they are now far too expensive. The Hotel du Vin is not far away, not much more expensive and infinitely better. Hiltons always disappoint me. I won't be back. I have a choice.","1","","2012-09-30","2012-09-11","2012-09-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r140011744-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

No information was offered as to when to return so we asked and was told check in was at three but if we came before a room would probably be ready.We came back later to be given our bags not told where the room was and there was someone else checking in at the same time as us, we shared the same lift and the gentleman spoke the same feelings that we had experienced.
The room was lovely large comfortable bed , spotless bathroom,and computer television etc.
Breakfast on the first day was a bit of a sham, putting bacon sausage mushrooms on a plate only to be left standing there waiting for beans and scrambled eggs which had been shouted for a couple of times , in the end I sat down and didnt bother.
Next morning was an even bigger sham, it was very busy admitted but again there was no one frying the eggs so my husband didnt bother, people were chasing the staff round asking for glasses for juice, asking for milk as the milk had run out, asking for coffee as the coffee had run out, and looking for additional cutlery.Not a very relaxing breakfast.
All in all the location was ok about ten minutes walk to the bars on the waterside.The room was great but there was no feeling to the hotel at all.","0","","2012-09-30","2012-09-10","2012-09-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r139929962-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We arrived earlier than the stated 3pm check in time, but were pleased to discover that our room was ready and we could check in straight away, which saved us leaving our bags behind and returning later on in the afternoon. Our room was on the second floor facing the busy road at the front; however once you got into the room there was no traffic noise at all which I think is down to the thickness of the glazing on the windows. 
The room itself was very clean, and has a modern feel to it. I felt maybe it was a little cluttered with furniture (mainly because of a large chair next to the bed and desk) but this is only a minor criticism. The bed also dominates the room, as it is so large- if you’re short like me you need a step ladder to climb into it! However, the bed is so comfortable; I slept like a log every night. 
A huge bonus was that there was a Mac computer in the room, which doubles up as the T.V, but there is free internet and Wi-Fi access which I think is great. I have never come across a computer in the actual bedroom before and I have to say, I was VERY impressed by this facility. 
The bathroom was also spotlessly clean, with a fab shower with the option of changing the water pressure from the shower head i.e. Jet, rain champagne etc which I think is a nice touch and was pleased to discovered that the complimentary toiletries are by Neutrogena (not the usual non branded variety that smell of Toilet Duck!) 
Now onto the breakfast...again very impressed! A great choice including continental (cereals, pastries and fruit) and a full English option of sausages, bacon etc. You could even order things from the kitchen, such as omelettes, vegetarian sausages etc. There was also a waffle iron to make your own sweet waffles with chocolate and Forrest fruits toppings...I’ve got to say I made a right pig of myself at breakfast, but everything was just so tasty!! 
I loved my stay at this hotel and have absolutely nothing negative to say about it. Consequently I have no qualms about recommending it to anybody; it goes without saying that I would visit this hotel again in a heartbeat.","0","","2012-09-30","2012-09-08","2012-09-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r139712371-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We particularly liked the free internet and I-Mac in our room. The breakfast was standard hot and cold buffet but certainly not worth paying what they were charging - we got this as part of the deal free because of being moved on from the Novotel.

Rooms were clean and refreshed well each morning, fixtures and fittings were of high quality, there was free WiFi, and the iMac entertainment system incorporating Sky Sports/free internet/JBL speaker system was a great addition.  Noise was pretty well suppressed except for when the window was open as the hotel is fronted by a busy main road.  The bathroom and shower were clean albeit a little on the small side.

The only negatives were that the hotel was a slight walk from the city centre (only 5-10 minutes though) and parking was a little dear at £20 for two nights.  There is a private car park close by but they don't do preferential rates for hotel users and it would be a bit of a nuisance to go back and forth to add tickets.

Even then, I don't think these little niggles are enough to prevent me rating the Hilton Garden Inn in Bristol as excellent and would highly recommend to others wanting to spend some time in Bristol.","0","","2012-08-31","2012-08-28","2012-08-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r138641319-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

A travel lodge may have been better.  The halls still have a vague odor of old tobacco use.  It appears the bathrooms were upgraded but didn't do a very good job.  The tap was loose, the toilet slow to flush.  When i called about the toilet one of the desk clerks came up and told me you needed to 'prime it first' then it would be fine.  Well, sometimes it took 4-5 pumps to prime and get it to flush.  Not a problem in a Travel Lodge but at a Hilton????  They also have a squeaky elevator that started waking me up at 6 am every morning on my 3 day stay.  The dining area was not kept up very well and they had a lousy system for serving.  It was not the fault of the worker bee's but I would say restaurant management.  They had one person cooking all 'eggs' to order and a full house.  Hence by the time you waited in line for the egg the rest of your breakfast would be cold.  I would stop doing all eggs to order and only do an omlett bar or have two people cooking the eggs.  Just badly organized.  The last hotel I was at was in Paris where I was a bit spoiled yet paid the same prize.  The Paris hotel has a very high rating by customers.  Hence, I may stay here again for value, but know I know it does not meet Hilton standards in my book.","1","","2012-08-31","2012-08-27","2012-08-27","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r138508161-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

If you are traveling by plain there is an airport bus from/to Temple Meads (just google from Bristol airport flyer). We found a very clean room with an iMac as TV and free WiFi all over the place. The stuff was very nice and friendly. On Sundays there was a special breakfast offer which I recommend (15 pounds for full English breakfasts for 2 persons). It is a 10 minute walk to the main shopping area around Cabbot Circus as well as the harbour side or the party areas. So everything can reached easily by foot. I would not hesitate to stay there again.","0","","2012-08-31","2012-08-26","2012-08-26","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r138418157-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Asked for a room swap as given room at fire doors which can be noisy at night. Quickly swapped room.
Agree with other reviews bathroom very small.  room nice, bed very comfortable and liked the mac. Room clean and better than a premier inn which is  other hotel we considered. 
Never got the complimentary  newspaper we ordered on both days as hilton honors members. Excuse on both days why we did not get. Never heard the word sorry.
Car was covered in seagul poo, when went to it after first night stay. Again no apology, i was told  they cannot contol the birds. Try putting spikes on your roof that would stop them. Other guest car was also covered in poo. This was clearly not the first time somebody had complained. They charge you £10 for this service. I said i would not pay and the receptionist agreed to this immediatley. Did i hear that word.....no sorry is not in the vocab at this hotel.
I would recommend this hotel if not using the carpark and paying no more than the premier inn.  Have stayed in nova hotel but as you will see it was some time ago.","0","","2012-08-31","2012-08-25","2012-08-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r138353106-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The manager even took the time to respond personally to my request which was very good of her. Don't expect all the bells and whistles of the full-fat Hilton but it's not supposed to be that. The decor was modern and looked to have been quite recently refurbished. The iMac in the room was a stylish touch made better by free Internet access. The cafe does very acceptable coffee to go.

Ended up buying frozen meal from the Pavilion pantry - what a fancy name for a fridge with poor quality overpriced frozen food. 
I asked staff to book a taxi for morning. Ended up waiting for a taxi which had not been booked. 
A very impersonal approach to guests. i wonder if it has something to do with how much they are paid. They just seem to be there to do a job not look after guests. I have stayed at various  Premier Inn hotels and staff are much nicer. 
The rooms are clean and have a modern decor and the imac is a fancy addition although I would have preferred a proper TV as remote is more straighforward to use. Other strengths include a fridge in room, good wardrobe space, microwave downstairs, gym- although did not use it
Some reviewers wrote about a wonderful breakfast. I found it to be ordinary and overpriced. No salmon as mentioned in some reviews. Yes there was a waffle making machine but waffles are really not my thing.

Sleep Quality: 5","Breakfast with super heroes!","This was a weekend stay in Bristol. No experience on other hotels, but as a frequent guest at the Hilton chain I decided to go with them. 

Arriving a bit late on Friday it was getting dark, and the short walk from the station didn't look promising - is the hotel in the middle of a business park and not in the city centre? Perhaps a bit of both: handy for corporate travelers, but later on learned that from the other side of the hotel you can also reach the thick of things very easily. Garden Inn is part of Hilton, but do not expect the full fat Hilton standards, nor do you pay for all the extras either. Rooms here are a bit compact, but that is compensated with functionality and comfort. Bathrooms look small, and they are but yet not cramped. Powerful shower, plenty of towels in various sizes and a very good variety of toiletries. Spotless all over.

Big beds, Apple iMac & tv hybrid with free internet - how good is that! Plenty of channels and all what you need from the internet. Fridge for your own stuff and further items available 24/7 by the reception. But naturally with a premium.

So for the super heroes... Ever had breakfast with Superman, Hulk and Batman? I did! Well, there was also a very bearded lady too.... this seemed to be high season for hen and stag parties (all over town). However, the ones in this establishment behaved. Even in the evening very well in order, not a sound during the night and particularly quiet during the breakfast.

And the breakfast is good. Plenty of choice at hand, and you can also get a good variety of items cooked to order. As it was a busy weekend, the breakfast was extended until noon. Again it shows that they give choice to guests, and in a very classy way separate early birds and the night owls. Simply brilliant!

Bar staff at hand and know their thing, but the bar is pretty clinical.

So why a 5 star rating? This is not a five star hotel with all the glitz and glamour, yet they provide truly good value for money. Where poorer quality places (think e.g. Premier Inn) claim to be cheap, they only turn out to be cheap in terms of what you get but expensive in terms of what they charge. This is definitely the case for weekend rates in Bristol, so go compare.

Staff very kind and responsive, they seem to take pride in what they do. Makes a difference.

Next visit to Bristol is in the cards, but the date is still a bit foggy. Choice of hotel is known.","6","","2012-06-30","2012-07-28","2012-07-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r135632606-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

On arrival we were made extremely welcomed and as it was my birthday I was given two drinks voucher to use in the bar later.

The room was comfortable and well presented.

We choose to eat in the restaurant and enjoyed a meal.  It was nice to be able to sit outside on the veranda with a coffee after our meal.

The breakfast was like a banquet - plenty on offer from Smoked Salmon to Porridge.  

Pleasantly surprised to find that the Harbour Festival was on over this weekend which meant the hotel was ideally located for the Harbour, City Centre and the Railway Station.  

It was great to have a Map of the surrounding area free from the Hotel reception.  We will defanety be returning to this hotel.","3","","2012-07-31","2012-07-25","2012-07-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r135316884-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

For about the same price as a premier inn I found this hotel and thought it a good opportunity to stay. I was very happy with its location forw work and on arrival knew I had made a good choice. The rooms are great and clean and well equipped with a comfy bed and imac which doubles as a tv and computer which you can use for free. The restaurant had a select choice of dinner options but what I chose tasted great even if it was a little small. Breakfast was just as good with waffles made to order!

As long as I can get a rate as competitive as I did this will be my number 1 choice when staying in bristol for work.

The products in the bathroom were lovely, and for once I actually used them, rather than the ones I had brought with me. The imac was exciting, even for me, a technophobe. I'm now very tempted to buy one! The flowers were lovely, as was the view from our room...overlooking a very green park. We slept very well, and eagerly looked forward to breakfast. Well, we weren't disappointed. The array available was immense and very very fresh. The options were many and I must say that the scrambled eggs with the cooked breakfast were the best I've ever tasted...beautifully creamy and soft. The recipe please! This  breakfast was really so good, better than that served in many more opulent hotels. Despite cheekily having second helpings, I still found some room when  idiscovered the amazing waffle machine. Well done to all the staff, especially those serving breakfast.
Would definitely stay again. Well done!","1","","2012-03-31","2012-07-18","2012-07-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r134721447-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We had a very nice bright room overlooking the park, nicely furnished good amount of wardrobe and drawer space nice bathroom, and the most amazing TV that was an apple computer as well, so I was able to keep logged in.

We did not have breakfast as it was not included and would of cost us £13 each, but there is a fridge in the room, so went to the local Tesco 5 minute walk away got some milk and cornflakes (we had taken bowls and spoons with us) we also put some sandwiches and fruit in the fridge so while we were out we only had to stop for a drink.

The tourist bus is just a short walk away, if you go out the back door, through the park and then turn left you will come to the stop, but if like us you are early risers then go to Temple Mead Station the bus will leave there much earlier.

There is a very nice restaurant which we might of eaten in as they take the Taste Card,(it had a very nice menu), so we would of got 50% off, but we had Tesco Vouchers to use in Cafe Rouge so we ate there in Cabot Circus which was a 5 minute walk away.

Parking is not cheap at £10 per night and can be hard to come by if you arrive late, although there is a car park at the rear. The hotel is well placed, being a 10 minute walk or so to the city centre. Public rooms are well appointed. The bar area has a comparatively inexpensive range of snacks and light meals on offer. The prices in the restaurant seemed reasonable though we didn't try it this time around. Breakfast is buffet style and the quality was quite acceptable though service levels creaked a bit under pressure when a large number of guests were present on Saturday morning.

Staff were generally pleasant and helpful.

The room was well appointed and serviced, though a drawer did not work properly and the small mirror in the bathroom was not secure and maintenance were not available to deal with these matters over the weekend. As before, wifi was free and a Mac was available for use, though the screen was rather small for modem tastes.

The bathroom had an effective shower but no bath. 

The room seemed quiet enough, but on Friday night a large party caroused until 4 a.m. in the morning shouting and screaming at the top of their voices. So, no sleep for me! I ought to have complained I suppose, but didn't. Hotel staff did not address this matter, though the following day a bottle of wine was offered as recompense when I finally complained.

So, still a good hotel but if they are going to appeal to the hen and stag party and equivalent crowd, they need to work out how they are going to manage in the early hours when things get out of hand otherwise clients like me might think twice before booking again.","0","","2012-06-30","2012-07-01","2012-07-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r133191109-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We arrived around 3pm and had trouble parking and had to use the pay and display carpark opposite the hotel which was a little annoying as we picked this hotel for hotel carparking but it transpires it turned out cheaper than the hotel carpark!
Check in was a little slow due to larger groups of men checking in but when we did it was quick and swift. 
The room was lovely. Good size and very modern finishes. Good technology available too - couldn't believe sky sports was available at no extra charge on the TV - never experienced it in a hotel before for free.
Bathroom toilietries were good - mouthwash included too. Towels and linen were fine and lovely power shower. Fair size and very clean.
The hotel isn't as close as I thought it was to the city centre - about 10-20 minute walk depending on how far you want to venture into Bristol but when you've got heels on it's a taxi job!
No complaints about noise and checkout was again fuss free.
Would definately stay again.","0","","2012-05-31","2012-06-25","2012-06-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r132736723-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

'Let them be seen and not heard', tends to be how it goes in my experience, which is very different to prevailing attitudes in other parts of Europe. Nevertheless, whoever trained the staff of the Hilton Garden Inn Hotel in Bristol did a stellar job in burying the aforementioned antediluvian attitudes. 

To a man and woman, the hotel personnel were as friendly and helpful as they come, starting in reception, at the bar and in the restaurant. The bar man even went as far as agreeing to arrange for a dish to be made for our little one which was not even on the menu! The breakfast team strived to humour him, as we attempted to feed him the most important meal of the day. So, top marks to everyone on duty on 17-18 June!       

More generally, the hotel is very comfortable for a mid-range establishment and, very conveniently, is located just a couple of minutes’ walk away from Bristol Temple Meads train station and the airport shuttle departure point. In addition, the waterside restaurant/bar area is 10-15 minutes stroll away. As mid-range hotels go, this one deserves all 5 stars: well done.","2","","2012-06-30","2012-06-21","2012-06-20","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r132419153-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We arrived very early and nipped in to ask directions to walk into the city centre. We were given a map, advised where to go and what to see and asked what we would like to do, and all this from a waiter who just happened to be in reception when we arrived! The room was very comfortable  and the iMac very useful. The Breakfast was very good with lots of choice and it was great having the eggs cooked fresh to order. I was disappointed about the £10 charge to park my car, if this was added to the cost of the hotel I would not have booked, so I did feel a bit hoodwinked about that, especially as there was no option but to pay.

The bedroom was spotless as was the bathroom, the room was a little hot requiring the aircon overnight but at least it has aircon! The bar area is quite modern and good service, beer is a little pricy however.Checking in/out was slick, and of note on this visit there are features that would appeal to anyone staying longer than a night or two IE gym & laundry room. Parking is available at £10 but must admit it is really tight and with the best will in the world you cannot help but avaoid door contact with other cards given the space available.","0","","2012-06-30","2012-06-10","2012-06-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r131659418-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

However there is still room for improvement. Online I was promised a queen sized room but the reality was a tiny room with a chair that didn't fit in the room properly if you wanted to use the cupboard, the fridge etc. You couldn't stay in this room for more than two nights as it was too small. A nice iMac in the room that is your tv but no keyboard but free wifi. A bit odd. Bought a bottle of wine from room service and paid £25 for a £7.99 bottle of wine. So don't do that.
Breakfast was ok you can order poached eggs, scrambled eggs with smoked salmon etc. Pretty good but quite a wait. 
Nice central location well within walking distance to most places. Overall a good hotel but rooms need work and a room service menu in the rooms would be nice.
Staff were all helpful. Not quite up to normal Hilton Standards. Wondering if the garden inn addition to the name means it's a cheaper version?","0","","2012-06-30","2012-06-09","2012-06-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r131619597-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

However, if anything, the hotel has improved - without exception all staff were excellent, food was of a high standard (we opted for a remarkably good value GBP 100 dinner, bed and breakfast deal), and the refurbishment that had been carried out had been well-executed. Minus points? The rooms are small for two people - the bathrooms very much so, and parking in the hotel car park is expensive (there is on-street parking that's free overnight but you have to feed the pay-and-display machine at 08:00).

The Hilton Garden Inn is now even better. It is very ably run by Mark the Reception Manager who is most obliging and leads a very efficient, friendly team. It was reassuring to be welcomed back by the great reastaurant staff and we thoroughly enjoyed all our meals. Our room was on the rear 5th floor which is quickly  accessed by the swift , silent lifts.Our room was very clean with a fridge, safe and tea making facilities. Rooms are well insulated to minimise disruptive noise levels. Car parking is £10 per day but there is a regular bus service right outside the hotel. Bar staff are very freindly and I must thank David the late night barman who can certainly make a superb cocktail. I thoroughly recommend this hotel and will definitely return. Thanks once again Hilton Garden Inn.","1","","2012-05-31","2012-05-21","2012-05-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r130358695-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Providing free wifi and a mac TV was excellent but to realise late at night that there was no drinking water in the room, although there was a fridge, was most disappointing.  As was the breakfast on the first morning which was cold and mostly cooked in water and the only plates available were cold. The beds were exceptionally comfortable and would have been even better if they were a little larger.Staff were excellent, from the moment we booked to checking out, with the exception of a  guy on the reception desk on the Saturday morning who obviously just didn't want to be there.

We had a great meal in the City Cafe on the Saturday night, presentation, quality and service were superb.  

All in all we would stay here again but skip breakfast and stock the in-room fridge with water.","0","","2012-05-31","2012-05-09","2012-05-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r129641936-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Hotel very clean in all aspects, staff most courteous and helpful, in particular the staff in the lounge bar and City Cafe.
Food in the City Cafe on both evenings was a delight, presentation and quality faultless, my compliments to the chef. Good value for money. Pleasent ambience.

A few minutes walk to the Bristol central train station made it easy to go places, and it is also within walking distance of the city historical downtown and within walking distance of the mall area.
Not too expensive it is a good choice for travelers.

I spoke to a lady by the name of Annie, she was most helpful and allocated us a top-floor room overlooking the pretty park. 
Room: fairly small but it had been beautifully refurbished and contained everything which we needed to make our short break comfortable. Large bed with crisp linen, plenty of storage space, 'T' tray, absolutely loads of mirrors and an, (empty), fridge, handy for our own drinks. There was a voucher to hand in to reception which gave us a bottle of water each, which was a nice touch. Quiet a/c, Mac computer. We loved it all.
Bathroom: Yes, on the small side too but spotlessly clean with large shower cubicle and endless hot water. Plenty of soft white towels. One bath robe, but a quick word with our room girl, sylvia, and she quickly produced another one so we did not have to fight over one robe. Oh, and slippers too! Thank you Sylvia, you are doing a good job!
Dining Room: We chose to only eat breakfast here. It is the usual feast for which Hilton is famous. The only critisism is that the food never seems hot enough but this seems to be a common fault with buffets. The plates were at a disadvantage too as they were kept on a shelf and of course, were cold.
Staff: friendliness and professionalism in an equal mix all contributed to make our short stay very enjoyable.
Would certainly return if the occasion arose because the position of the hotel made exploring Bristol on foot so easy.","2","","2012-04-30","2012-04-22","2012-04-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r128341903-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It's last incarnation was the City Inn, very little to denote its now a Hilton, other than the door signage. Rooms are excellent, with Mac PCs and everything you'd need for a short stay. Only criticism is that there is one chair too many in the rooms, making it rather cluttered.

The mini bar has been replaced by a vending area in reception, that rather randomly serves microwave ready meals?

Only change that I could see was the breakfast is now from a servers rather than al la carte as the City Inn had.  As a result, the breakfast, whilst good, was not great.

The location is excellent, a few minutes walk from Temple Meads train station, adjacent to a photogenic park with ruined church where we had photographs taken.

Drinks and canapes on the terrace overlooking the park and then a formal meal in the restaurant where the food is excellent quality.

The hotel car park is quite small but there is a pay and display less than 100 metres away which compensates for this.

The rooms are finished to a good level and a reasonable size too. Common sense applied, this isn't a 5 star hotel and doesn't claim to be, but it certainly DOES exceed the expectation for the price and I would highly recommend it for a Bristol city centre visit.","1","","2012-04-30","2012-04-16","2012-04-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r127969452-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Staff were polite and attentive, genuinely interested in us having a good time. Craig, the General Manager, runs a very good ship.
The bedroom had recently been refurbished - you could smell the new carpet aroma !! 
Bathroom immaculate and clean. Great large shower cubicle. No bath but not a problem.
iMac computer and tv. Really useful to be able to look up local weather and attractions without needing to bring or find a separate pc.
Breakfast buffet was superb. A wide choice of cereals, yoghurts, pastries, porridge, breads and full English selection. Also able to order salmon and scrambled eggs, black pud, kippers and more. Exciting to be able to cook your own waffles in a waffle maker. Not cheap at £13.95 but you could eat enough to tide you over lunchtime too !!
Rear of Hotel overlooks small churchyard and is very quiet. Front may be noisier, as it fronts onto Temple Way. Car Park a little cramped during the peak but better than walking too far with cases.
About 5 mins walk from Temple Mead railway station.
10 mins walk to Cabot Circus and Broadmead Shopping Centres - the former a very smart, modern complex, some under cover, some not.
The riverside Bars and Restaurants are a shortish walk away and offer plenty of variety.

*iMac in room
*fitness room (though very small)
*location- right by Temple Meads
*comfortable bedding
*curtains block out all street lighting

Cons:
*disappointing breakfast- scrambled eggs very sloppy; everything kept running out and had to wait 10mins for more to be brought out on two occasions; when breakfast is busy, waiters are very slow to serve tea/coffee
*mini bar in room not stocked- you have to go downstairs to the lobby to buy food/drinks
*shower temperature was occasionally burning hot even turned down to lowest heat setting and sometimes fluctuated from hot to cold
*air con did not work in one room I stayed in
*iMac in one room I stayed in was slow and kept crashing

Booked the hotel when it was still the Mint, and we were not informed it had changed to the Hilton Garden Inn prior to our arrival.
I much preferred this hotel as the Mint (stayed there May 2011)- there was a better breakfast selection and mini bars in the rooms were stocked with good quality snacks (like Green & Blacks chocolate).","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/5f/a3/de/en-suite.jpg

Loved hotel before - still like it now. Gym was always rubbish - now is great with brand new machines on ground floor and about 4 times size. Resistance machine and free weights, although no bench so a bit limited to use weights. Need to sort out the automatic lights as go off when on machines - but only gripe.

We arrived mid afternoon on Tuesday & parked in the hotel's car park after which we explored the city using public transport (bus stop outside front door ) & on foot. The bedroom was relatively quiet with the window open ( quieter than the air con. ) The beds were very comfortable & the fridge enabled us to keep fresh milk & other drinks chilled. The fittings were of a high standard ( Matki shower screen ) Apple TV . We ate in the cafe rather than the restaurant on the second night of our stay & enjoyed a very well cooked & presented meal which was good value. All the staff were friendly & helpful & we would definitely stay again.","0","","2012-03-31","2012-03-08","2012-03-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r125817680-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It has been great since it was a City Inn, then becoming Mint.
The rooms are always clean & fresh. The food is tasty & value for money - and the bar has had some interesting ales on in the past.
Check in & out is always easy.
My only gripe is the parking. There is not nearly enough parking, and you often get some chancer blocking you in. One poor guy blocked me in when I was due on site at 05:00, so reception had to wake him up. I didn't have the heart to mention that I could have collected my car after the meeting!

I had booked a club room at a club room price. However, because I needed a twin the room seemed quite small, I thought club rooms were bigger, they used to be. But not on this occasion! I did enquire and was told that there is only a small allocation of these rooms. Oh well! My fruit platter was not in the room upon my arrival, I ordered a newspaper for the following morning and it never materialised. The breakfast was so basic in terms of no service, I was served tea and nothing else, I used to have toast and a cooked breakfast made fresh to order and delivered to me. The trouble with a DIY breakfast is when everyone comes to breakfast at the same time, you end up queuing whilst your cup of tea is going cold. Breakfast I found quite stressful. 

This hotel used to be great, now I'm not so sure!","1","","2012-02-29","2012-02-23","2012-02-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r125093518-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Otherwise the room was very nice, good size and very clean with the added advantage of mac computer/tv. I paid an extra £10 for a club upgrade,this gave me VIP status, although I didn't notice any difference in my status from staying in an any other hotel. I did get fruit in the room and a welcome drink so maybe that was my status upgrade!

The hotel is a 10 min walk to the city centre but if you didnt want to go too far I found a nice italian restaurant immediately across the park at the back of the hotel.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/56/f5/a6/mint-hotel-bristol.jpg","2012-02-29","2012-02-16","2012-02-16","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r124674142-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The bedroom was not huge, but it was very pleasant and quiet which was just what was needed.

There was some construction work happening so breakfast was in a different room, but this was carefully explained and the breakfast was a perfectly calm and pleasant experience.

Car parking was £10 per day.There was a bus  stop directly outside the hotel and the regular  bus service  took you to the flourishing  Cabot Shopping Centre and harbourside which has a wide choice of restaurants.   The railway station is  conveniently located a few hundred yards from the hotel  We had a rear room on the top floor and  never heard any traffic. The lifts were silent and efficient. Agnes the Receptionist was particularly  pleasant and very helpful. We visited the fascinating MShed museum on the harbourside  which  has free  admission  and enjoyed  an outstanding interactive display of the historical development  of Bristol and its people.  There was a charge to visit the display of fashion photographs on the 3rd floor. Have booked another stay at The Mint Hotel next month although I understand it has just been taken over by the Hilton so I hope it maintains its high standards and customer focus.","0","","2012-02-29","2012-02-13","2012-02-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r124539670-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Not in the most picturesque location but a good option if going out in Bristol as relatively close to everything. Especially good location if you've driven or got the train.
Breakfast was excellent with a really big choice. Although if I was having to pay for it on top of the room (ours was included), I probably would have said it was a little pricey. One word of warning - the bar man may proclaim that he is an amazing cocktail 'mixologist' but he made me the worst cocktail I have ever tasted (he put creme de menthe in a Long Island Iced Tea???) and took about half an hour to make it. My boyfriend also had to talk him through his choice. Meanwhile a table of 3 were still waiting for their beers, which they had ordered before me! Was very frustrating but in hindsight pretty amusing.

They were rebranding from the Mint hotel to Hilton Gardens on 13.2.12.  The rooms were a little on the small side but were more than sufficient, with a comfortable bed, plenty of lighting, an iMac, plenty of wardrobe space and an iron and ironing board.  The bathrooms were new and clean with rainshowers.  They are a little on the small side, so you may struggle if you are on the larger side.  The car park was open air and had about 50 car parking spaces and was well lit.  For busy times when you can't get in the hotels own car park, there is an open air NCP next door - also openair.  The hotel was in a good location for us, about a 10 minute walk to the bars and restaurants at the harbourside, probably slightly further to the shopping area.  It was quiet at night, so you were not kept awake by revellers in the street.

I searched TripAdvisor for a suitable overnight stay with WiFi an absolute priority so that I could file my piece for my newspaper on Sunday morning. The Mint was close to the station and with an old, decent Italian restaurant within walking distance. Having navigated a huge roundabout and eventually found the correct street I quickly checked in , left my bags and went to work.On my return I discovered how bleak the area was and apart from the big , imposing roundabout, the office blocks stood bleak and empty on a Saturday night ion the snow. Come to think of it The Mint was rather similar, not the sort of place you would want to linger for a meal on your own or even a drink at the tiny bar. The saving grace was the room. Basic enough with a nice big bed but excellent in terms of plugs, access to WiFi, mac and excellent and multi use apple television. Work was soon done.But there it stopped.The bathroom was so small that when ( if I may be briefly indelicate) I sat on the loo my legs poked out into the room and as a somewhat large man I had to manoeuvre myself around the shower and sink. Not comfortable at all.
Despite paying £75 for a weekend night, with refurbishments going on, breakfast was not including and the restaurant was not inviting enough to pay for a breakfast. Instead I walked to the station and settled for and orange juice.
Not a hotel I would return to.","0","","2012-02-29","2012-02-10","2012-02-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r124382059-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

And that was really how I found the whole hotel - nice staff, gimmicks, but not the room basics - some real maintenance issues.   Perhaps this has suffered because of the prospective sale?  I also found it overpriced (and I was on a corporate rate) - I have stayed in better hotels in Bristol on a cheaper rate.  

On the positive side It's very well located for Temple Meads station (easy five minute walk,  very friendly front of house staff (especially the sommelier) and it was very clean throughout.  The public areas are pleasant.  On the poor side was my bathroom:  shower would only pump dangerously hot water.  You could rotate what I assume was the temperature control  - there are no symbols or instructions - right round and make no difference whatsoever to the heat of the water (I did check the other dial, this just turned the flow on or off).   Since the shower was too hot to stand under, I had to wash my hair in the basin using a mug- there are no baths.  Hairdryer was missing from room.  Metal fittings fell off the bathroom door - appeared to have been glued back on before.  Before all this I rang reception to ask something, the call was not answered for ages and was eventually rerouted to room service who said reception would call back.  They didn't. 

Breakfast was so overpriced I ate by the station - £2.99 for coffee and a bacon and mushroom roll rather than £11 (at check in) or £15 (walk in) in the hotel. Incidentally the soap / shower gel etc is in a wall mounted pump - not what I expected for this room price.

Maybe it will get sorted out under the new brand.  Hope so, very convenient location but disappointing.","2","","2012-01-31","2012-01-23","2012-01-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r123497974-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is located about 10 minutes’ walk from Bristol Temple Meads station and about 10 minutes’ walk from the main shopping and bar areas. Our room overlooked the park next to Temple Church and the area was quiet at night. Bristol seems to be a popular destination for hen/stag parties and groups going out at the weekend, and quite a few people checking into the hotel seemed to be there for these reasons, but we were not disturbed by any noise.

The room was standard Mint Hotel. Everything was clean and as expected. Bathrooms are small but functional. There’s free wifi in all rooms, which is great. The rooms also have iMacs which double up as a TV/computer which is useful (there’s a little instruction card next to the screen if you’re unfamiliar with iMacs, and the ‘on’ button is on the reverse of the screen).

Our room rate included breakfast, and I would have been very disappointed if we had purchased it separately as it was not good. We did arrive quite late into the breakfast service, and the restaurant was busy (full of those who had been out the night before), but the staff could have at least tried to smile. There was no welcome, our order was taken quickly and we felt rushed. The cooked breakfast was poor and badly presented and we were given small portions. The coffee was stewed and not drinkable. This experience was an unpleasant end to an otherwise enjoyable stay.

I’d stay here again, but avoid breakfast. The three out of five rating is due to the bathroom being small (a bath would be nice), some of the decor being a bit worn, and breakfast being such a disappointment.

Bristol tip: Clifton and Clifton Suspension Bridge are worth a visit and are easy to get to. From Bristol Temple Meads station take a No. 8 bus. The stops are announced on the bus, so get off at Clifton Village or at Christ Church, Clifton. The Bridge is a short walk from either of these bus stops and there are lots of shops and cafes in the area. On the way back, take the No. 9 bus.","2","","2011-11-30","2012-01-08","2012-01-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r122769991-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The food was very good - room service was hot and reasonable.  Breakfast is full English to order or a contintental buffet.  I would say to the Breakfast Manager though that if someone knows what they want and asks you for it on arrival, interrupting half way through the sentence that a waiter will help, who then doesn't materialise, could be handled better.","0","","2012-01-31","2012-01-05","2012-01-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r122569274-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Definitely recommend ordering food from the room service menu if you are stuck in the room at night with bad weather outside. Enjoyed their main course (duck) and desert (Baileys cheesecake). Reception was really helpful. Location wise the hotel is ideal - short walk to Temple Meads station (there is a Starbucks and Weatherspoon on the way to the station) and the main shopping district (The Galleries, Cabot Circuit) is within walking distance.","0","","2011-12-31","2011-12-17","2011-12-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r121827907-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It does have its own carpark (£25 pn, I think) and there is also near-by on-street parking that is free between 6 pm and 8 am but metered thereafter.

Hotel & rooms:  We have stayed in one of the London Mint hotels previously, but Bristol Mint is not in the same league as the London ones.  The reception & bar area are old fashioned looking and completely lacking in atmosphere.  This is, in part, due to the drab lighting/decor and partly to do with the fact that the bar man allowed someone to plug in their own ipod at full volume - someone else's taste at high volume managed to clear the bar area within minutes.   The rooms are pleasant enough - clean & functional with comfortable beds & bedding and the bathroom, though small, was clean also.  

Food:  We only ate breakfast so cannot comment on evening meals. We had the full english included within our package price, but as it was almost inedible, i would have been extremely annoyed if i'd paid for this seperately.  The continental elements were ok but I think they should have mentioned that they clearly didn't have a trained chef in house, as we would have been happy enough with the continental.  I had porridge unlike any porridge i've ever had before, in that it was just oats & milk mixed together and clearly had not been cooked.  My husband had fried eggs that were as solid as frisbies.  Horrible!

A clean, functional hotel near to town & motorway.  I'm not sure that it can be classed as 4* but on the other hand, it was very reasonably priced, so perhaps we got what we paid for.  Personally, I would not use this hotel again.","0","","2011-12-31","2011-12-13","2011-12-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r121699147-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Drove around a bit and asked someone who just happened to be staying in the same hotel and she said that they had had difficulty also. Eventually found the hotel - the trees outside had obscured the hotel name and it looked like an office building. (as you come off the temple circus roundabout - the hotel is adjacent to the temple way dual carriageway- turn left and then left again into temple rose st) The rooms were very IKEA, they were clean and added touches as bottles of wine, crisps/peanuts in the room to tempt you to part with your money.
Breakfast was included - help yourself to cereal and pastries but full english was plated. 
Small bar in hotel and not much directly around the hotel but within a few minutes walk in either direction you came accross pubs, shops and restaurants. 
For the price we paid I was pleasantly suprised.
There is a car park in front of the hotel but if you gain access and there are no spaces you will need a token from reception to exit. There is a pay and display car part accross the road from the hotel (at the rear of the hotel) it was free from 6.00pm to 8.00 am","1","","2011-09-30","2011-11-14","2011-11-14","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r120570313-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Breakfast was very nice and service in the breakfast room was also very good.  Only let down were the bar staff who, whilst being friendly, gave a 'cant be bothered' service.

Rooms are small and cosy, but what sets this hotel apart from the many others, is the modern and clean environment - and the attention to detail of the hotel crew.  They must have rigious SOPs, because my room is serviced and cleaned to the same high standard everyday - without fault.  Something the larger hotel chains such as Hilton should take notice of!

Apple Macs in the room is a cool concept, and blends in with the smaller room sizes here.  However, I find myself using the laptop anyway - but definitely a point of difference with other hotels.  And the free WiFi is much appreciated for the business traveller.","2","","2011-11-30","2011-11-05","2011-11-04","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r120181746-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We had breakfast included in our deal and it was really very good - much better quality than the mass produced options in many hotels. Only thing I was disappointed in was when we called down to book a second night we were quoted a much more expensive rate. When checking this on the free Apple computer in the room we got it for almost £50 cheaper- would have been nice to be offered this as an existing guest!

The reception service on arrival was first class, friendly and accommodated our request for a room at the back of the hotel. Our room was OK, though a bit tired in places. The hanging space was very odd, not deep enough even to hang a standard gents jacket – about 8 inches too short leaving the jacket dragging on the lower rail or the floor of the cupboard. It would've been useless for a full length dress.

The bar service on our visit was shockingly bad. One evening, having been told by the barman that we would be attended too at our table, he promptly served 2 further couples (who were not there when we arrived). We gave up and left, to find the mini-bar in our room was locked! At the drinks prices charged by this hotel I would have expected much better levels of service. On enquiring at reception the following day about the mini-bar, we were told they are locked at the weekends due to the high number of stag and hen parties they have, who do not pay for drinks. You've been warned.","0","","2011-10-31","2011-10-30","2011-10-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r119893291-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Everything you’d expect from a good hotel, even a Mac in each room which doubles as a TV and lovely shower room, safe and mini bar. We thought the room slightly on the small side or perhaps it had too much furniture in it, however, it was very clean and the bed was excellent, we booked at the last minute and got good value. Although the restaurant looked nice we decided it was a bit pricey and there are plenty of restaurants and cafes within 10 minutes walk, we found two seventeenth century real ale pubs and a good Italian restaurant within a 2 minute walk, through the park. 
You pay for parking, par for the course in a city centre but a useful tip is to get your money back by not having breakfast and go to one of the two cafes 4 minutes walk away, towards the bridge, for a fry up or a croissant and coffee. It’s very handy for the city centre, the shops, nightlife etc, staff are friendly and we’d go back to it anytime.","0","","2011-10-31","2011-10-19","2011-10-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r119483125-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The Mint Hotel is perfectly located between the train station and the main city centre which means it is ideally placed for a weekend away.  The Hotel always lets you leave your bags there before you check in which means you can arrive whenever, drop your bags off and start exploring the city.

The room is comfortable enough to spend time in when you're not exploring and is a very reasonable price for the facilities that you have on offer e.g. imac in room used as home entertainment system.

I arrived by train into Temple Meads Station and walked just under 10 mins to the hotel. I was able to check in about an hour early. The receptionist gave me an efficient, but not too friendly welcome. I just put it down to her being a bit tired, like we all are at work from time to time. 

My room was on the 1st floor overlooking a small park and above the hotel Restaurant/Bar. The room was very clean, with great facillities. The Apple Mac computer/tv/entertainment system was brilliant. Although it took me a while to work out how to turn it on etc. I did find instructions afterwards. My own fault for not looking for them first.

There was a minibar/fridge, which was locked, presumably a key is needed from reception.

Bathroom was clean and modern with The White Company shower gel/handwash.

There was also an iron and ironing board in the room which was really handy.

The city centre is within walking distance and very easy to find. If you are travelling to Bristol Airport, take the Airport Flyer, which is around £6.

Checkout was quick, and a lot more friendlier.

I would reccommend Mint Hotels for a city stay.

TV in room is also computer MAC - so you can Skype or facebook if you wish! Here is the not so good points: Parking is ten pounds a night and incredibly tight to park. Location is business area, so little in the way of immediate night life. Very very busy during the two nights I stayed and service at main desk is a little slow.. The rooms are quiet so you can relax. If you eat in the ""Fine Dining Restaurant"" you could be hungry afterwards (I suggest the bar and add more to the menu it is the same kitchen).

Wernt expecting that much from breakfast but we arrive to the largest selection I've ever seen, all types of cereal, toast, fruit, cheese. There was also a menu of cooked food to order. I had smoked salmon and scrambled eggs which were delicious, as I was in a rush I asked if there was any chance this could be made asap and the staff were all very friendly and ensured I was not late for my interview.

My husband and I stayed here and we were able to walk to all the places we wanted to go - nothing seemed far away. The room was lovely and althought the view wasn't great,  we didn't expect anything else being in a city!! The room had a computer and wifi which was useful.
The bar was quite expensive and so we went out rather than staying at the hotel for a drink. The food was good, but again, wasn't cheap!
The breakfast was great - a massive choice and plenty to eat. The waiter/waitresses were all very helpful and polite which was lovely.
In fact, we found all the stff to be helpful.
We couldn't fault the hotel and will staying there again!!!","0","","2011-05-31","2011-10-02","2011-10-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r118856792-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We had a room for two but only one bathrobe was supplied also one tiny little bottle of shampoo was left in the bathroom for both of us!!!.
The tissue box was only topped up with a dozen or so new tissues (what's wrong with replacing with new).
The bottle inside the shower ( which i assumed was shampoo) was actually handwash.
And the real sting in the tail came when we were checking out - the hotel gives the impression that parking comes with the Hotel rate - but the cheerful man on the check out desk asked me if I had a car in the car park and when I told him I did he asked for ten pounds!!!
Mint still has a few things to learn about attention to detail.","0","","2011-09-30","2011-09-18","2011-09-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r118273124-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The bed was very soft, so didn't get much sleep.  Was initially given a room facing the dual carriageway out side, but was changed on request to a room on the highest floor facing the park at the back (nice and quiet).  The MAC computer was a nice touch, but the tiny remote was very fiddley.  The best thing about the hotel was the breakfast.

On arrival we were told the restaurant was full and wouldn't be able to eat there. The room was dirty, small, smelly and dank. We did manage to get the taxi, what a miracle! Finally the next morning, we had to queue for breakfast for 10 minutes as half the restaurant was closed for some reason.

The hotel is near Bristol Temple Meads which is an ideal base to explore Bristol and Bath, which is what we did. Breakfast was very tasty and we had a fantastic time. Would definitely recommend to others.","0","","2010-08-31","2011-07-29","2011-07-29","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r115988423-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Small room, but adequate for single traveller and very well designed. Walk in shower - no bath, but White Company amenities. Free wifi in hotel, room doesn't have tv but an iMac which was good for playing DVDs etc and you can surf web if no laptop. Air con in room was good. Breakfast in the morning was good quality - overall one of the nicest hotels stayed in of it's class for a while. Will definitely stay again next time in bristol. 

Only criticism was the fitness centre - was a small guest room with one bike, one treadmill and one multi-gym. No real floor space - there were two of us in there and all felt a bit too intimate trying to share machines. It was also 1,000,000 degrees in there - whether air con wasn't working I don't know but was like working out in a sauna. I don't think would bother with gym again - shame as so few hotels get gyms right now. ","0","","2011-07-31","2011-07-15","2011-07-14","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r115379529-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 5","No idea why it's a four star hotel - more like a three star one","I stayed here for a night to have a look round Bristol for the first time and also Bath, which is really close to Bristol. The location of the hotel is great for the latter as Temple Meads station is just a five minute walk away. But the hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the generally not so nice shops and pubs of the Broadgate and Cabot Circus areas and a good 20 minute walk from the Harbourside and Old Town and even longer from Park Street. This was a major pain as I like to come back to the hotel a few times while I'm staying at places to freshen up, dump shopping, change clothes and what have you. But the location of this hotel made all this quite impractical for me and I got plenty of exercise anyway walking up the hills in the city centre! I wish I'd researched the location properly before booking.

The main reason why I chose this hotel was because of the iMac in the room. What a great idea and all for free, as is the free wifi. I hadn't used an iMac before but found it easy to use.

My double room was small as was the bathroom but not much of an issue for one night. 
I slept like a log and you could hear a pin drop on that night I was there, and I think this was due to there being a lack of loud types on my floor. Like some other reviewers, I found no dressing gown for my use either, which was disappointing. Apart from the iMac and the White Company tolietries, I didn't find anything luxurious about the room at all.

Staff on reception were excellent - warm and professional.

I fell in love with Bristol - a vibrant and civilised city with an exciting mixture of the old and the new - and I'll be back but I doubt I'd be back at this hotel.","1","","2011-06-30","2011-06-28","2011-06-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r114839588-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The package in Bristol included the room, plus 2 breakfasts and two dinners . We are experienced travellers so we are used to all sorts of hotel rooms...but we were disappointed that the room we were given was very compact, not really a room suitable for 2 people.  Like other reviewers of this hotel we found the room to be small...it was very ""crowded"" with furniture that took up the floor space, making it quite difficult to move around.  The bathroom too was tiny with limited space for our stuff.  Anyway, we didn't mind too much because the room is only to sleep in really. The hotel is close to the station, it has an OK breakfast, and is modern and clean.  What disappointed us was that to have the dinner which was part of the package, reservations were only available after 8pm each night. On the first night there were 3 ""mains"" on the menu...one was a liver dish so that was out...there was only one ""cod"" dish left...so all up that didn't leave much for us to choose from.  This must be a regular problem as the staff refused to remedy this for us.  When we tried to book a table for the second night, again there was nothing available until after 8pm!!  And the menu was the same menu as the first night.  We decided to cancel the package for the second night . There were some positives though...the bed was comfy, clean etc, and we appreciated having a minifridge and free internet/computer/TV.  It wasn't a hassle-free stay overall though and there was also an issue we had to sort out with our bill when we checked out.   At the end we were happy to leave, and we don't think we would stay here again or recommend it to our friends.","0","","2011-06-30","2011-06-23","2011-06-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r114672159-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We had been here before a few years ago when it was the City Inn; on that occasion, everything was OK, but it was very noisy.  Friday nights can be a problem with hen, stag parties etc. This time, improvements had been made to the windows, so that road noise had been eliminated and the corridors etc. seemed pretty quiet, too. The room was small and the bathroom was even smaller, but it had been designed very well and there was everything a guest would normally require. There was no bath, which I was slightly disappointed with.The TV was also small and flat-screened and seemed to have more channels than is usual in hotels of this kind. The beds were comfortable and we had a reasonably good night's sleep.
The best thing about our stay was the food in the evening. Although the meal had to be chosen from a fairly limited set menu, it was excellent.  The portions were quite small, but the food was rich and therefore filling. There was plenty of bread anyway, which was some of the nicest bread I've ever tasted. The champagne wasn't bad either, considering it was part of the deal! The only bad part was the coffee, which was awful, very bitter and strong.  I usually like strong coffee, but I couldn't drink any of that.
Unfortunately, we didn't think the breakfast was quite so good. We prefer a buffet style, where guests can choose what they want and how much or how little. This had to be ordered and brought by a waiter. It was OK, though disappointing after having such good food the previous evening. Again the coffee was undrinkable, but I had tea, just in case.
The staff were very nice and helpful; the waiters were unobstrusive, but responded to our requests when required.
We thought the £10 car park charge was excessive. We were only there from 7pm on Friday to 9am on Saturday; most city car parks are cheaper after 6pm and before 8am, so if we go there again, we'll park in a nearby car park at half the cost.","1","","2011-05-31","2011-06-19","2011-06-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r114380865-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Partner stays here often with work and is a fan, due in part to a perfect work location, and I didn't book it this time.  For the price though (£80) it is very good - our 5th floor room was spotlessly clean, the location is still great and the iMac, toiletries and excellent restaurant make it better than than much of the competition.  To expect better than this for the price is expecting too much - for example moaning about the size of the gym seems excessive.  Yes the bathroom is on the small size but it made me marvel at the design that allows an ironing board and iron to be provided - rather than complain that there was too little space.  Yes the mattress is a little on the soft side but we slept perfectly well.  We stayed on a Friday night and there was no sign of stag or hen parties and we avoided the £10 parking charge by just parking on street.   The restaurant was fully booked and obviously has a good local reputation.

I definately want to compare this with the Future Inn next time we are in Bristol but there were none of the mistakes encountered last time and objectively this is an excellent overall package for the price.","0","","2011-06-30","2011-06-19","2011-06-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r114302207-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Short walking distance from Bristol's quayside entertainment district. But beware Bristol on a Saturday night - you can't budge for hen and stag dos, all slaughtered, and the hotel was full of them too. Had to move from our first room as it was obvious the neighbouring rooms were full of stag-doers, so it was clearly going to be a noisy night. Staff were happy to accommodate us in this, however, so that's fine.

However it has become increasingly noticeable that things like breakfast and parking which were once included in a reasonable-all in price are now added on as expensive extras.  Breakfast, in particular, simply is not worth what is charged for it here.  The room service menu is also expensive and there is an eye-watering ""tray charge"" in the small print which increases prices even more.

But across the road from the station is a new Holiday Inn Express which has breakfast included and next time I am going to stay there.

The Mint hotel is about a 10 min walk from the station (turn right out of the station and around various roundabouts). It looks like a converted office building from the outside. You can't see it from the station in case you are looking!

Reception: this was good - very friendly and efficient.

The room: I had read the reviews beforehand so I knew it was going to be small but the bathroom was suffocatingly small. I had to put down the toilet seat so that I could put my clothes somewhere and then wedge myself into the shower without hitting myself on the sink. The promised dressing gown was missing and only one large towel provided. It was a relief to get out of the bathroom. Can't room service provided two large towels and the promised bathrobe?

The room itself was too small with an addition of a table and chair as well as a desk and chair just to make it feel really cramped. The bed was low and uncomfortable. I didn't like the Apple TV as I found I had to wave the remote control around to change channels and there were no film options. I did read that reception had an extensive range of DVDs so I went down but she didn't have any (so why mention it in the room guide?)

I paid £85 for the night without breakfast so it wasn't worth the money in my view. The only good point was the free WiFi so I could use my iphone to keep me entertained!","0","","2011-06-30","2011-06-10","2011-06-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r112607150-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

How disappointing. The hotel itself - from reception to the room - is barely beyond a Premier Inn, save for the presence of the iMac. Restaurant was good, through service was hopeless on several levels.

Disappointing, and I wouldn't return.","2","","2011-05-31","2011-06-06","2011-06-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r111886891-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sleep Quality: 2","More like a three star than four star establishment","We stayed here for one night whilst visiting a relative.  We had a friendly greeting and didn't have to queue to obtain our room keys (of the plastic credit card sort).  Although we could have paid to park outside the hotel for £10.00 for 24 hours, we parked overnight for free in the NCP car park at the back of the hotel, and then £1.50 for all-day parking near the SS Great Britain on the floating harbour.  The hotel is right in the centre of town and good for reaching the local amenities. 

The bedroom was generally clean with the exception of the keyboard for the Imac which was filthy.  The bed, whilst larger than the UK king size, had a very hard mattress and fairly flat, lifeless pillows, so that we didn't have a comfortable sleep at all.  The bedlinen was stained and old and the thin undersheet/mattress protector was so creased that it could not possibly have been straightened from the previous occupant.  This I found most offputting and I hope that the hotel takes note! 

The bathroom was clean but tired: the tap on the sink was very stained and old and the nozzle on the ""free"" soap flew off every time we pressed down the plunger.  Only one towel between two of us was provided but at least the water pressure in the shower was strong and perfectly acceptable.  

Breakfast in the morning was produced in the City Cafe and distinctly average and disappointing.  My partners' ""Full English breakfast"" barely covered the centre of the plate and was tasteless and my muesli was mediocre in the extreme.   Next time we visit Bristol we will certainly be looking at other establishments before this one.","1","","2011-06-30","2011-06-06","2011-06-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r111852022-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Staff are excellent.  It's a short walk to the city centre, shopping area and train station.  Just two points to raise - not all that important for the stay - just to be aware of:

- Our room had an i-Mac on a desk - inkeeping with a fairly trendy, minimalist, white room - but this is also your TV, so it's not comfortable for lying on the bed with a partner to watch TV as it's all at an angle.  Of course, I didn't come to Bristol to watch TV, so not a huge issue.

- A much bigger issue is the breakfast.  Hotels like the Mint make breakfasts for up to hundred people (maybe more) each day, every day.  So why are they so bad?  The meat in the fried breakfast was really poor quality.  The coffee was awful.  Absolutely awful.  But most importantly, we were tempted to eat there on our second evening and the breakfast put us off.  

Anyway - good value and reasonably nice.  Sort out your breakfasts and we may come back.","1","","2011-04-30","2011-05-30","2011-05-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r110561996-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

A few niggles such as the mini bar did not open and there were no dressing gowns provided as advertised, plus we got a complimentary bottle of wine in with the rate for early booking but there was no cork screw, so we had to go to reception, then the bar, then the restaurant to get one. Breakast is nice but not work the £15 pp price tag if it is not in with the rate. Saturday morning at 8.30am all was calm but on the sunday morning at 10.30 things were a little more hectic with a lack of attention to customer service and a lot of dirty plates left on tables. 

The hotel is well placed, around 15 mins walk either way to the harbourside or Cabot Circus. 

Overall, this Mint is a little below the standard of the others in the chain, but it is older, and it still provides a good standard of accomodation for the price and i would stay there again if returning to Bristol.","0","","2011-05-31","2011-05-23","2011-05-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r109478455-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I had booked the room several months earlier on a 'Spring Break' package and so the room and full cooked breakfast were included for £79. It was also a pleasant surprise to find a complimentary bottle of wine in the room as part of the package.

The room was comfortable, clean and bright - if a little small. This didn't matter to us though as we were only staying one night. A previous guest had been kind enough to leave us their chewing gum on the end of the headboard and it's shame that this wasn't removed by housekeeping. The bed was comfortable and we got a good night's sleep. The window does open wider if you manually release the catch but we preferred to have the air-con on as it was quieter. The iMac and free wifi were a nice touch and very useful.

The breakfast was OK but I would've been unhappy if I'd had to pay the full price (£14.95) for it! The bacon was inedible and looked reconstituted. Tea, coffee and toast were hot and tasty though.

The service from the staff and the front desk and from the waiting staff at breakfast was great - very polite and helpful with the few queries that I had.

The location was good for Cabot Circus and is in an area where there are lots of offices - a fair walk to the city centre most of the nightlife. If you're happy to get a taxi then it's not an issue :-) 

The car park was £10 for 24 hours but I didn't think that was bad to have the car just outside the front door. We were able to leave the car there whilst we popped to Cabot Circus the next morning which was a great help.","0","","2011-05-31","2011-05-08","2011-05-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r107416285-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms were slightly on the small side but very clean. Only negative point was that the shower was a dribble most of the time with water actually stoppig on occasions on our last morning. They did offer to move us but we were about to check out anyway. They did say that there were water works being carried out in the area, but having spoken to other guests they were not experiencing the same problem 
The Apple Imac entertainment system was very good with fast internet and Sky Sports! Regarding the food we booked  this stay as part of a meal deal so a 2 course evening meal was include. This was beautiful food, slightly small in size but cooked to a very good standard. 
Breakfast was cold buffet help yourself or order s full English from the waiter which was very good. They seemed to of sorted bthe problem with the tea & toast as it came out just before the hot breakfast.

Booked the mint on tripadvisor reviews and price as was only using as a base to help us to explore Bath with a half day exploring Bristol penciled in also.  
The location was good for temple meads station which we used to get to Bath and airport bus but a bit of a walk into town.  We had previously stayed at the london city inn and liked the contemporary rooms and decent value but this place was way insuperior and i have also been in the bar of the glasgow city inn and again this place didnt seem to match up.  I asked for a nice room in advance and we were given only 1 floor up looking out onto the heads of the smokers from the bar so was noisy and was woken at 4am on the sun morning by a stag doo returning.  It felt no more than a fresher premier inn to be honest, the noisy fire doors in the corridors also kept us awake.  Went for a drink in the hotel du vin on one of the nights and wished we maybe should have opted for there but i know it was a bit more cash but prob worth it.  We only got 1 towel changed over even though we left 2 in the shower which was annoying.  My wife thought she had ruined her dress from the iron as it kept leaking, i almost burned a shirt as the base had someone elses melted top on it......replace the £3 plastic irons with decent ones!
I liked Bristol & really liked Bath which was a shame as the accomodation didnt match up.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights at the end of March for a bed and breakfast birthday break.  We arrived by train at Bristol Temple Meads railway station and walked for seven minutes along an easy route to arrive at the hotel.

We arrived early afternoon, before the 15:00 check-in time, yet the very helpful and friendly reception staff checked us in without any fuss.  A room at the rear of the hotel was requested, which over looks a small park, as the front rooms overlook a busy dual carriageway.  I did get to look around a room on the front of the hotel and noticed that the window was treble glazed, and almost no road noise came through.  However, being treble glazed it was not possible to open the window, unlike the opening double glazed ones we had at the rear of the hotel.

The first impression upon entering the room was as to how small the room was, and the shower toilet washroom was the second smallest I have ever seen in a hotel.  Yet the washroom worked very well and was a pleasure to use.  The toiletries were of a very high standard, being from The White Company.  There is no bath, but the shower worked well..  The room had all the usual things you would want, a big safe to fit a laptop into, mini bar, ironing board, iron, hair dryer, coat hangers, and the large bed was very comfortable.  The TV was an iMac, which had free access to the internet, with a built in DVD player.  The very stylish telephone was by Jacob Jenson, the designer behind many Bang and Olufsen products.  We slid the small coffee table under a dressing unit, and pushed one of the two chairs against a window, then the room had more space and was more usable.   The air con worked well and was silent unless the fastest fan speed was selected. 

Breakfast was very nice with very helpful and friendly staff serving.  We were able to eat all that we would want.  Fruit juices, cereals, rolls, yoghurts, cheeses, fruits, rolls jams etc, were on offer at tables   However, for the cooked breakfast a waiter takes your order from a menu and it is brought out to you soon afterwards.  I do prefer a breakfast where you go up and help yourself to hot food from a counter.   One bad point is that on both days we had a long delay between between ordering tea and coffee and it arriving on our table.  In fact the hot breakfast food came first on both days.  It is nice to be able to drink coffee or tea fairly soon after sitting down at a table, and before cooked food arrives.

We did not take dinner in the hotel, so cannot say what it is like.  We walked the fifteen minutes or so into town to eat out.  At the rear of the hotel is a small park with a ruined church in it, and at the end of the park is a small Italian restaurant called Marcos Olive Branch.  We had a very nice midday snack there.  Down stairs there are a small number of soft chairs to relax in or upstairs there is a more formal dinning area.

We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would return again.  It is not a large old sprawling hotel, it is more of a very clean modern, and functional hotel.  The good points are; It is close to the train station, shops, and docks area, has free internet use on the room iMac TV, and all staff encountered were very helpful.","2","","2011-03-31","2011-03-28","2011-03-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r101871490-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Breakfast was hot and to a high standard service once again very efficient.Great nights sleep second night. Had a late check out which was very nice.

The bathroom was also spotless with a brilliant shower and lovely toileteries (no need to take shower gel, there's a lovely big White Co pump for your use)and lovely fluffy white towels too -Yes- the rooms are a little on the small side compared to other chains eg- Marriott/ Hilton etc but what you lose in square footage you gain on the welcome you recieve- without exeption the staff were excellent.  The food in the restaurant was excellent too - (delicious home made bread), but don't expect big portions!

We were allocated a room at the end of the corridor which has a service cupboard behind it, although it didn't cause any disturbance to us there were a couple of occasions where people were rumaging around that could have woken you up had you been asleep.

The rooms are very well laid out however a little on the small side, with bathrooms only having a shower this may be a downside for some.

The iMac entertainment system is really good and the free wifi throughout is great considering how much some hotels rip you off for.

We ate in the bar on the Sunday night and the food was very nice, staff were very attentive and helpful, and the prices fairly reasonable.

There was differences in the breakfast depending on the day of the week, Sunday morning breakfast was good, with a fairly standard selection of cooked items available to order and the usual continental affair.  We arrived towards the end of the breakfast serving and some stocks were starting to run low/out which is not particularly great given the 4 star plus rating the hotel aspires to on it's own website.

Monday was a different affair with a much larger selection of items including kippers, haddock, smoked salmon & scrambled eggs also a lot better quality food as well.

We managed to get the B&B rate for £68/night for 2 which was pretty good value given that cooked breakfast is £14.95 each if not taken in advance.

All in all a good stay at a nice hotel with some good options at no extra cost.","0","","2011-02-28","2011-02-14","2011-02-14","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r96557722-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

If you book far enough in advance, as I do most of the time, some very competitive rates can be had.  This hotel in Bristol (I have stayed with Mint in other cities) has the best location for me, just a few minutes stroll from Temple Meads stn and a few minutes stroll from Cabot Circus you are in the heart of Bristol.  No need for expensive cab fares, everything is within easy walking distance.

The rooms are to a very high standard of comfort, cleanliness and facilities.  My favourite being the Apple imac entertainment system. With free wifi and computer access, you couldn't ask for more.  The bed is so comfortable you really do not want to get up in the morning but then knowing you have an amazing buffet and cooked breakfast waiting for you, i can just manage it. That is if I can prize myself out of the amazing power shower (White company, London, hair and body wash provided).

Mint hotels are my personal favourite brand and I always look forward to my next visit.","0","","2010-11-30","2011-01-04","2011-01-04","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r91695902-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I opted for Mint because I'd dined (well) here on a previous business trip. Check-in was hampered by 'the computers being very slow at this time of day', reception staff were very professional and charming though. The restaurant was completely booked by a party so the hotel had lifted the tray charge for room service - which seemed reasonable for a solo traveller but I'd have been disappointed to dine in my room otherwise. The room was however very well styled, Mac TV and slick facilities. Catering was exceptionally good and good value, highly recommend.

Breakfast was buffet-style for a wide range of cold options and a very good cooked breakfast to order. Check-out was seriously delayed due to a huge group of cyclists (complete with bikes) clogging up reception for 20 minutes. Reception staff were, again, very apologetic, however, unless this group turned up on spec - which seems unlikely - can't help but feel that the hotel management was remiss in not making advance arrangements for checkout. Subject to group bookings, and the hotel's ability to manage them, I'd have no reservation in staying again.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/bb/c0/31/mint-hotel-bristol-1.jpg

Do not use the lifts if anyone else is in there. there we 8 of us in a lift that stated maximum capacity of 13. After becoming stuck in the hot, confined space, we buzzed the emergency bell for 15 mins and the door opened. Expecting concerned staff i was dismayed to hear the only thing said was ""it was overloaded"" by a sullen member of staff to her colleague. myself and another lady had become very distressed being stuck in a confined space and this was the last thing we expected to hear. i would have gone back to the room for a cup of tea, however there were only 2 regular teabags for our two night stay. Everything seemed to be in a strange place, we never did discover where the hairdryer was! the room was hot and it was very noisy. 
We were charged for breakfast which we had not had. they also attempted to charge us for two days car parking when we had only used the car park for one day.

The location is great for walking from the station (although that means it's probably not very well located for any onward business meetings).

Check-in was fast and my request for a quiet high-floor room had been taken to heart - I don't think I could have been higher or further from the lifts :-)

My room was a bit warm when I arrived, with the air conditioning running and the window open (grr, what a waste of electricity!). That was soon fixed by closing the window and secondary glazing fully (cutting out all of the noise from Temple Way) and letting the air conditioning do its job.  The dials on the air conditioning unit seemed a bit strange, almost as though they wouldn't work, but despite that I was able to change all the settings I needed to.  (The system reset at about 8.50 in the morning, so you might want to bear that in mind if you intend to sleep in.)

I always seem to have a strange experience with the restaurant's maitre d' and yet again was met with the ""have you booked a table"" and much working-out-if-there's-room, despite the fact that for the duration of dinner about half of the restaurant was empty. Once seated the waiting staff were attentive and the food from the Garden Menu was lovely (and an absolute bargain)

Unfortunately the WiFi network had a problem for the duration of my stay (network was up, wasn't giving out IP addresses) so I wasn't able to get online to do a couple of bits of work. Not a massive problem, but annoying as the free WiFi is one of the reasons I stay at City Inn for business trips.

My room was clean, shower was nice and powerful, bed was comfy (though yet again I suffer my ""one and a half pillow"" problem).  Was VERY pleasantly surprised to find a power socket next to the bed, practically unheard of in modern hotels and makes having my iPhone next to the bed (for the alarm) possible. Well done City Inn - it would be nice to have this in ALL of your hotels.

Breakfast service was prompt and the food delicious, though I wish there had been some background music playing as the room felt very strange (and too quiet for many to want to talk).

Fast and efficient check-out and surprisingly no credit card slip to be stapled to the bill. I definitely like that!","1","","2010-10-31","2010-10-08","2010-10-07","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r82549981-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was  good the bed really comfy very nice  bedding,  The bathroom/products/towels,bathrobes  were lovely.We did not spend a lot of time in the room so did not get around to the internet but I would imagine very handy for some.
Tip  If you arrive by train Temple Mead,  Bypass the main exit go past the booking office and  out of that exit straight across the carpark past the motorcycle park and you will come to a small complex of shops pass them go left past Weatherspoons and that road takes you opposite the City Inn This all takes less than 5 mins. 
Later on if you have the time go back   go straight past Weatherspoons and you come to the canal a really nice walk.","0","","2010-08-31","2010-09-15","2010-09-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r79701136-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The building itself looks more like an office block, as does the reception area, no sense at all of the syle you'd get from the other bracnhes of City Inn.  The bar and also the breakfast room have more in common with a no frills chain.  

It's the little things that work well for city inn, lovely table settngs, great breakfasts, care over the way things look, service, good wi-fi and the great city inn style. All of this was missing, the only little thing about this branch was the bedrooms. 

I'm a massive fan of city inn and very loyal to them,  but this was not at all close to the standard they normally set, a real let down.","1","","2010-08-31","2010-08-30","2010-08-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r77468758-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

You can just about live with the space saving in Westminster (which was considerably more), because you are getting a great deal, and top quality service in the heart of London- but the size of the rooms in Bristol is just ridiculous.   It was virtually impossible to fit a food tray through the door!!  The bathroom, again is claustrophobic, and you can barely sit down on the toilet! 

Also, I noticed that the fittings in the Bristol hotel were preety shoddy.  With some of the chrome plated bathroom fittings crumbling off.   Just didn´t give off any sense of quality.  Yes, the Imac with free internet, and a broad range of sat channels is a great idea, but on it´s own is not a reason to book here.  The food was reasonable, although the room service menu doesn´t compare to their Westminster hotel.  The staff are not a patch on their Westminster hotel either. 

I was generally dissapointed,  and glad to get out of this broom cupboard of a room. The windows in my room were terrible as well- with only one opening, that you could open literally two inches- which defintiely added to the general sense of claustophobia.
 
I don´t think it´s unreasonable to expect the same standard as their Westminster hotel.  The price of the land should be cheaper in Bristol, so why scrimp even more on space??  

Location is perfect for business travellers being so close to the station, but far from perfect for people wanting to explore the leisure attractions.","1","","2010-08-31","2010-08-25","2010-08-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r76789282-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms are perfect for a one or two night break, not huge but plenty of storage, very clean and everything we needed was there. We had a room on the first floor, normally I prefer much higher due to noise issues but our room faced the rear and it was so quiet and peaceful, even for me a very light sleeper and with the Harbour festival going on.

Breakfast was very good, we went down at 09.30 and they were running out of some of the rolls etc but feel sure as they were servisng until 11 they would of been replenished. 

What made this stay nicer than Birmingham? The service. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient and gave us our rooms even though we arrived early (expecting to just be able to leave our bags and go off into Bristol) with no problemjs whatsoever. No pressure to leave a credit card on the booking for any extras. 
The staff in the dining room for breakfast were extremely friendly and helpful, really pleasant. We had pre booked and paid for breakfast in our package but our room numbers were not on the list for inclusive breakfast and none of us had our slips - that was no problem whatsoever, they took our room number and we had breakfast and no grief when checking out with any extras. This has happened to us several times over the years and everytime we have had to explain more than once we have paid and have even had issues when checking out so it was a refreshing change to find that we had no issues here.

The hotel is a very easy 4 to 5 minute walk from Bristol temple Meads Sattion and about 10 minutes or so to Cabots Circus etc.

Yes I would stay here again, well done City Inn for helping us have a fab weekend in Bristol and keep up the good work.","0","","2010-07-31","2010-08-01","2010-08-01","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r73280180-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

However, this trip to Bristol’s City Inn was a real disappointment. When we arrived we waited 20 minutes to be checked in, not because they were busy but because the two members of staff on the front desk had no idea of what they were doing. On top of their incompetence they were being rude to the customers. We were given a disabled room. We were not asked if that would be Ok, in fact it wasn’t as I am partially sighted and I kept banging into things in the bathroom and went home with several bruises. When I asked about changing rooms I was told that was not possible. This hotel does not have a great location but normally I would be glad to overcook this because the hotel and service are so good. This time I felt that the poor location, problems in the room and the unhelpful staff spoilt the trip. I still stay in City Inn Hotels in other cities but in Bristol I have now switched to an alternative with a better location and friendlier staff.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8e/5a/db/the-bristol-balloon-fiesta.jpg","2009-08-31","2010-07-08","2010-07-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r70115766-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

He wasn't wrong!  Before I go into specifics, this hotel is fabulous for business travellers.  It doesn't have the swimming pool you never have time to use, what it does have is some of the smartest technology in any hotel I have ever stayed at in the whole world.  I'm an Apple fan, so this place was bound to please and I was gobsmacked to walk in to my room to see that it actually did have a fully functioning Mac!  You can get TV, DVD, hotel information and obviously the Internet!  I even had a skype call with my fiance!
The hotel itself is a little walk from the City Centre and the car park is small - it was full when I arrived so I had to park elsewhere until later in the evening.  The hotel also charges £8 per day to park your car, even whilst staying as a guest.
The room itself is very modern and had a fully stocked mini bar (many hotels don't do this anymore, so plus points here to City Inn).  In addition to the Mac desktop, all of the hotel provides free wifi (Marriott take note!) which worked flawlessly.
Air Conditioning in the room is powerful so kept me cool on what was a very hot day.  The bathroom was small but functional with shower that seemed to either spray hot or cold and not warm!
I took breakfast in the hotel and it was cooked to order with a wide (but not huge) selection of items.  
Overall, for £75 per night, this is a stunning hotel for business travellers.  The City Inn concept has clearly had a lot of thought put in to it and the rewards are there to see - at the time of writing this hotel ranked 6 of all hotels in Bristol.  It's a breath of fresh air in Bristol - I've tried most of the hotels here and they're all awful apart from City Inn.  From a cost/benefit point of view, this is without doubt the best hotel in Bristol.  I cannot rate it highly enough.  All of the other hotels in Bristol are a very poor second when compared to City Inn.","0","","2010-06-30","2010-07-05","2010-07-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r69747940-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

On the plus side, the location is fine - 5 minutes walk from the station, 10 minutes to restaurants and shops. The City Inn philosophy seems to be to offer luxury standard at cheaper prices by skimping on the room sizes and location rather than on service levels as other budget chains do. Therefore, the room was very nicely furnished. It wasn't spectacular though. - maybe that's because this hotel is over 10 years old now and others have now caught it up. The room was also very small - fine for just 1 person & their stuff but I think it may have been a bit cramped if Mrs D had been in tow on this trip. Although there was air-con, it was a bit noisy and rattly. One undisputedlty nice touch though was the I-Mac in each room with free wi-fi.

The restuarant food was good but service not brilliant which let it down a bit. We also had some problems with the air-con and Wi-Fi not working in the meeting rooms which the reception staff tried their best to fix but again these problems spoiled the overall impression a bit.","0","","2010-06-30","2010-07-02","2010-07-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r69423757-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms are basic but provide everything you could need for a comfortable stay.  The iMac TV/Computer is excellent for evening viewing, internet access and watching dvd's with a selection available from reception.

I had a broken showerhead in one room and reported it when leaving for work, reception checked if I minded someone being in my room during the day and on the return from work it was fixed, no issues!

The staff are friendly and helpful and when staying for a long period of time make you feel very welcome and valued as a guest.

As I flew home every weekend I left a holdall behind the reception with toilettries and items I didn't need to carry home and back, the staff were more than happy to help with this.

The restaurant, lounge bar and room service menus offer a vast selection and if there is something you fancy from the lounge menu while in the restaurant they will make it for you without any issue.

The hotel is an ideal location, come out the back door and through Temple Gardens, turn right and within 5min you are at the waterfront bars and restaurants or keep walking and another 5min and you are in the centre with Cabot Circus shopping centre, cinema and food halls.

We travelled to work from Templemeads train station and again the hotel couldn't have been handier, the station is literally out the front door cross the lights and cut through the square - 4 min!

I'd definately stay at the City Inn again and recommend to friends and colleagues, I even got 2 bottles of wine as a thank you for staying 25nights!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8a/41/d2/the-walkway-from-back.jpg","2010-03-31","2010-06-10","2010-06-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r67107336-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Travelers able to obtain a good rate will likely be happy with their stay, but at prevailing hotel rates, most visitors would likely be happier in one of the larger chain hotels.  Read on for more...

LOCATION:
  The City Inn is located on Temple Way, on the east side of downtown Bristol, very near the Temple Circus roundabout.  The hotel is within easy walking distance for guests arriving by train at Bristol Temple Meads station (~5-10 minutes max), and also within easy walking distance of the key shopping and dining areas of downtown Bristol.

PROPERTY:
  The hotel is a rather dormitory-like 4 story building, decorated in an Art Deco motif, and feeling somewhat institutional upon first entry.  The hotel is clearly geared towards business travelers, though it seems to try and loosen up a bit on the weekends with happy hour specials and other perks in the lobby-level restaurant/bar.  Rooms on the front side of the building directly abut onto Temple Way - a busy 4-lane thoroughfare, so road noise is a bit of an issue.  Rooms on the rear side overlook Temple Gardens, a small park situated between the hotel and the neighborhoods surrounding the river where most shopping and eating can be found.

ROOMS:
  The rooms are actually a bit larger than can usually be expected from UK business hotels.  The room had a small bar-service area near the entrance, a large king-sized bed, a work desk, and an armchair with table.  A new iMac in the room doubled as both a functional Internet-connected computer, as well as the television for the room.  Unfortunately, the spaciousness of the room did not extend to the bathroom, which was quite tiny.  The sink is a corner-unit to save space, and the shower is a small 3'x3' cubicle with an ingenious fold-in door, which is necessary since opening the shower door into the bathroom would be impossible due to the size of the room.  However, water pressure was great and there was an ample supply of hot water in both the mornings and evenings, so it was serviceable.  The Inn offers room rates that include breakfast -- though unless you have to eat at the hotel for reasons of time or lack of transportation, there's ample opportunities for better, less expensive breakfasts nearby.

AMENITIES:
  There is free wired and wireless Internet access in all guest rooms.  The hotel's modern restaurant offered 3 meals a day, including a ""Market Lunch"" which offered a seasonal selection of items for dine-in or take away.  The bar was geared toward an extensive wine list, though was comprehensive in its offerings.  The prices for ala carte items in both the bar and restaurant seemed a bit excessive, though there were good-deal price-fixe options for both dinner and lunch that would be good value.  Most visitors will likely want to wander into the riverside neighborhoods for meals, though as other guests have mentioned, the walk through un-lit Temple Gardens can be a bit unnerving after dark.  Visitors arriving by car will likely have a gamble ahead of them, as the parking available on-property is simply a narrow strip of concrete along the face of the hotel -- available at about 8 GBP per day.  Those unlucky enough to get locked-out of the on-property lot will have to use the nearby municipal parking garage.  On the positive side, the garage is free until 8 AM -- but on the negative side, daylight parking is charged for at a normal downtown scale, so hotel guests leaving their car behind may face a significant parking bill for their stay.

STAFF:
  The staff were helpful and efficient, with a reasonable knowledge of the surrounding area, and a willingness to help organize local transportation and dining.  We didn't interact much with the staff, but the property seems to be well-run.

Overall our stay at the City Inn was pleasant, and for the price paid, we got great value in downtown Bristol.  Rates seem to vary significantly from day-to-day, so most visitors will want to shop around a bit.  At a rate of around 65 GBP, this hotel is inexpensive for its location, but with midweek rates that can exceed 100 GBP per night, it doesn't have the atmosphere, comfort or perks that you'll find in other major UK or international chains.  But if a good rate is available, most travelers will be pleased with a short stay at the City Inn.","1","","2010-04-30","2010-05-23","2010-05-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r65114400-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Sad to see that it has been left to go a little tatty now with our room at least being scattered with stains and dents. You don't expect the earth for £79 a night but it now has the air of a slightly more stylish Danish travelodge than a 4 star hotel. 

Check in on the Saturday was fine - We were allowed to check in a little early in fact. The addition of Imac to the room I thought was quite a nice touch as were nice sized wine glasses. Just disappointed to find hairs in the bathroom and the stains etc.

Slept really well - The bed was comfortable. I did find a really long grey hair in my bed. I am bald so it wasn't mine! Maybe Crystal Carrington had been staying? 

Very good breakfast and nice that it is served until 11am on a Sunday. £8 car parking which seems reasonable for a city centre hotel. 

Saying that I would head for Brasserie Blanc down the road or the brick house instead of eating at the restaurant as it was not that cheap. 

I would go back but only on a laterooms £60 deal or similar. Recommend with a health warning.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/85/9f/b4/a-hairy-gift-awaits.jpg

However, the parking is tight and the car park was completely full when we arrived.  We dropped off the bags and asked reception what our options with the car were.  They suggested that we use the NCP cark park nearby which we would have to pay for.  As we were about to move the car, a space became free and we ended up parking on the hotel site.  However, the next day I just so happened to notice that street parking is free on Sundays yet this wasn't suggested to us by the hotel staff!  Being in a foreign city these things are not always obvious, and any helpful advice such as this would have been greatly received.
 
We didn’t fancy the walk through the unlit park in the evening to get to the restaurants and bars and so we ate in the restaurant downstairs. I ordered vegetable lasagne which arrived as layers of carrots and beetroot without any of the usual features such as tomato sauce and cheese!  They charged us ?10 for this, which was the size of a starter without anything on the side.  My Italian girlfriend was insulted that they could actually call this lasagne!","0","","2010-04-30","2010-04-20","2010-04-20","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r61988222-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Friendly and efficient check-in. Room spotlessly clean, on the small side but lacks for nothing.  Comfy bed.No decent lighting for reading in bed - but that is the case with most hotels nowadays.  iMac and free internet in the room is brilliant, especially if, like me, you strongly object to most UK hotels and their pay-for-broadband policies. Also gives an excellent TV picture.
Car parking in the street is free(plenty of space)  between 6pm and 8am and all day Sunday, so you can avoid the hotel car park charge if the timing fits.  
Cooked breakfast was better than the usual  standard - it is not a buffet, so the fill-your-plate types may be disappointed but it is freshly prepared and of good quality. It meant I could safely choose scrambled egg without risking getting that watery, lumpy stuff beloved by so many hotels across the country. Coffee not bad at all (again a nice change).
One gets the impression that the management  is making a serious effort  to get things right and the staff seem cheerful, friendly and eager to please.","0","","2010-04-30","2010-04-12","2010-04-12","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r61132582-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We arrived a bit early (1pm) but we could check in (in few minutes) and access the room immediately !

Room was perfectly clean, bright, confortable and pleasant (overlooking Novotel, the other side is maybe less pleasant as overlooking a busy road). Bed was confortable and we were not disturbed by any noise.

Nice details in the bathroom: good pressure shower, nice toiletries.

We were surprised to find an Imac in our room with a free access to internet anytime and access to TV/radio. Its definitly a plus !
Kettle and ironing table (we didn't use but looked in good condition).

We used the room service on easter evening. Food was delivered in 30 min, it was good and price was reasonable. (see my review for the restaurant which is great). Breakfast was delicious, a real pleasure. There is a buffet with pastries, fresh juices, fresh yogurt, cereals and you can order full english breakfast, salmon or anything on the nice menu. It was well cook and staff was pleasant and helpful.

Great stay and would definitly go back to this hotel and recommend it to my friends. Very good value for money and can't find anything faulty.","0","","2010-04-30","2010-04-06","2010-04-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r60545164-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is very new and contemporary, it has it's own private free car park which is great (subject to availability as it's not very big).  The rooms are very clean and all have an Apple iMac  which our 8 year old daughter absolutely loved!  We were lucky enough to have a room facing the back of the hotel which overlooks a park and was nice and quiet (the front of the hotel faces a very busy road so may be noisy)  The staff were very efficient and friendly and the continental breakfast was wonderful with lovely fresh fruit salad, yummy pastries etc.  We got a good deal on the room, around £50 for the three of us including breakfast. We were asked if we wanted the continental breakfast or a cooked breakfast, we thought that we would have to pay extra for a cooked breakfast so we stuck with the continental, but we heard other people being told they could choose a full English if they didn't want the continental at no extra cost so we were slightly disappointed as myself and my husband would have opted for the full English had we known! . It's well situated for visiting the city, just a short stroll and you're in the centre.  We had a very pleasant stay and would definitely use this hotel again if we were in Bristol.","3","","2009-07-31","2010-03-19","2010-03-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r58999447-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

This week I had service that went the extra mile - I got into a taxi at Temple Mead Station in Bristol to be told by the driver that the hotel was a 5 minute walk. His directions were not good and when the 5 minutes stretched to 15, I called the hotel for more details. Within a  couple of minutes one of the duty receptionists had come out, scouted around, found me and escorted me the last 1000 yards to the hotel and helped me with my luggage.

Sleep Quality: 5","Great Hotel. Helpful staff, great food and comfortable bed all at a very fair price.","This is a great Hotel. The staff are really helpful and friendly. A few examples: 1) Dealing with my personal breakfast requirement. 2) advising me on great dishes to try and supporting wines. 3) Putting a large desk into my room so I can work at a desk in the evening. This attention to my requirements make this a good hotel, but the very friendly nature of the staff and a smile turns this hotel into a great hotel for me.

Location: The hotel is located within a few minutes of the train station and on a good route in and out of the city towards the M32 and M4 or A4 towards Bath if traveling by car. The hotel is also situated near a number of good pubs and restaurants that are no more than 5-10 minutes away. (It took me about 10minutes to get to the city center.) I particularly liked the Seven Stars pub (CAMRA Pub) - 1, Thomas Lane Redcliffe, Bristol, Bristol, BS1 6JG. The hotel is also only 10 mins from the new big shopping arcade called Cabot Circle, and well worth a visit.

Hotel Restaurant: The food here is very good. It is well worth finding out what the dish of the day is too. The bread in the evening is home made and is excellent. As mentioned earlier they will go that extra mile for you. For example I wanted gratin dauphinois potatoes and the chef cooked it specially for me, to go with my beef. I have also tried the bar food and this was very good value and good too, I would recommend the sausage and mash which came with the best onion gravy I have ever had.

Parking: The only minor downside for the hotel is that it does not have the largest of car parks, and seems to have had a number of very poor drivers who do not know how to park in a single parking space. But I have never not been able to park at the hotel. 

Facilities: There is a small gym here, but I do not use that. There is FREE Wi-Fi and an apple I-mac computer in your room. This for me the icing on the cake, normally hotel make you pay a fortune to use their Wi-Fi service. The I-mac computer is great (and modern too), it also has many TV channels, including sky sport 1,2,3 and many many other channels (Some that I have never even heard of before). This is great since I know if I am staying here I will not need to bring my own laptop as there is a computer with good bandwidth to use in the room that will meet all my needs. I love using this computer and being able to write emails to friends and watch the TV all on the same screen, like I am doing now. 

I have already recommend this hotel to my work colleagues and plan on staying here again when I visit Bristol again on business or pleasure.","1","","2010-02-28","2010-02-15","2010-02-15","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r56080843-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I stumbled upon this hotel by chance a few years ago, and have since gone on to stay at the Bristol venue well over 50 times and have frequented the London, Birmingham and Manchester locations as well. What I love about the chain is it does the simple things very well, and doesn't try to shaft the customer in the process. Not content with providing free wifi (Which at some hotels can be £15 for 24hrs) they also provide the computer, and not just any old PC but a iMac in every room. This iMac doubles as a TV with a great  array of channels, including Sky Sports, Film Four etc No need to pay for overpriced in room movies, as at front desk they have a current and varied array of DVDs to borrow at no cost. Staff are welcoming and friendly. But the icing on the cake for me is the food. Despite travelling on the companies Visa it still grates me when I am forced to pay £15 for a fatty burger and fries, plus a £4 tray charge. At the City Inn they recruit exciting chefs, cooking a seasonal contemporary menu. This menu can be ordered straight to your room, £16.95 for 3 course - fantastic value and always a joy. After a hard days work, its one of the few places I look forward to heading to and feels like home from home. Have got several of my colleagues using it and the feeling is mutual. Can't recommend it more.","0","","2010-01-31","2010-02-11","2010-02-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r55764524-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel was OK to find, had to put a different address in the sat-nav, as it is on a dual carriageway so no chance to stop if lost.  We arrived early as had seen on previous reviews the car park is small but it was half empty when we got there. Only a five-minute walk to Cabot Circus and the other shops so that was good. Room was a little small than I've come to expect in hotels but it has everything you need including ironing board in the wardrobe, dressing gowns and a safe. The imac is a brilliant idea as it is TV/stereo/computer, the free internet is great and even better as I don't take a laptop with me, so great to be able to use the internet in a hotel for once. The food in restaurant is fabulous, we had a five-course dinner and a three-course brunch with some really interesting food, although the service can be a bit slow. Something horrific must have happened in the kitchen in the morning as was waiting for nearly half an hour to be served. The staff were all really friendly even when they were having a disaster.

The hotel is in a good, quiet location very close to Temple Meads railway station and is a good base for exploring Bristol.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  They seemed to know the area well and were happy to provide information about the city.

The double room was spotless and perfectly adequate. The iMac offering a good selection of TV channels and free internet access was a nice touch.  The shower was much more powerful than ones I have encountered previously in hotels in this price bracket, although the ensuite bathroom was rather cosy.

Only real gripe was that service was seriously slow in the bar.  On a Friday evening at 6pm we had to wait an age for cocktails and on returning to the hotel at around 10.30pm on a Friday night there was no-one behind the bar. There was only one member of staff in the bar and she appeared to be flitting between the bar and the restaurant.

The cooked breakfast was good and there was a decent continental selection.

Overall, I'd say this is a good place to stay that's better than bigger chains who offer rooms at similar prices in the city.  I'd be happy to stay here again when next in Bristol or to use other branches.","0","","2009-11-30","2009-11-28","2009-11-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r50199747-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The room was modern, stylish and spotless. (I agree with a recent review that I had the impression of being the first person to stay in the room.) I loved the I-mac (Free TV/Radio/Music/unlimited internet access all-in-one). If I'd known what an I-mac was beforehand I wouldn't have taken my laptop!

Whilst waiting for my colleague at a seating area in reception one afternoon, even the manager, who introduced himself as Angus, asked if I was staying in the hotel, was I enjoying my stay, and if I wasn't completely satisfied with the service and facilities, and should I have any problems or complaints, to ask for him personally. I have rarely encountered such a high level of personal service in a hotel of this size. Considering I had to be away from home for over a week, I found it a proper home from home.
The central location of the hotel is good and is pretty easy to find. It is about a 5/10 min walk from the train station, and about a 5/10 walk to Corn St, King St or the waterfront (more bars, restaurants and clubs than you can shake a stick at). Parking is limited, but on the odd occasion I couldn't find a space, there is a reasonably priced pay and display right behind the hotel. As for a review saying the spaces are tight in the hotel carpark, I was driving the work's Honda Accord Estate which is a big beast, and I didn't have too much trouble!
Overall, I was extremely impressed with the hotel and surprised that it wasn't far more expensive. I look forward to staying there, or hotels in the same chain in other cities, in the future.","0","","2009-03-31","2009-10-22","2009-10-22","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r47476283-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

However, from the inside out, this hotel was brilliant.   The hotel is located within 10mins walking distance of Bristol's shopping centre.  There is parking (which is limited) on site.  This is £8 per 24 hrs.  However, if you are at the hotel during the weekend, it is free to park on the side street on a Sunday.

The hotel has 5 floors with a bar and restaurant.  We asked to stay on the 5th floor so we couldn't hear the noise from the main road.  The rooms are spacious with apple macs in every room, giving you free access to the internet, which is a bonus.  The rooms and bathroom were both very clean.  We had breakfast twice there.  You can choose from an English breakfast, continental or both.  Could not complain as the standard of food was very good.

The receptionist made us feel very welcome.  No complaints at all and I would stay there again.","0","","2009-09-30","2009-09-21","2009-09-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r43290580-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Fundamentally, when I walk into a hotel room I should feel like I am the first person to stay in that room. That all the fixtures and fittings are intact and the bathroom and furnishings are clean and finished to a high standard. I have access to all the information from the local area and what most hotels charge as extras such as Internet Access are included in the price. When I have a problem, I am dealt with courteously and professionally by the hotel staff and that my stay in the hotel is uneventful so I can free to experience the place I am visiting and not have an experience at the place I am staying.

This Hotel has the details exactly right for a budget to intermediate traveller expecting a good standard of service and stay. Want more? Pay more - get less.","0","","2009-09-30","2009-09-13","2009-09-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r41384226-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I think it was obvious that all the staff, from the reception to the bar and restaurant and house duties, are being stretched to breaking point, but who can honestly say it's any different at the place where they're working at the moment. 
The things I really liked where the rooms, location, fitness room, bar tender - he actually greeted with me using my name throughout the stay; I've never known this anywhere else I've stayed.
The 2 things I didnt like were that the bedding ie the duvet and pillows smelt a bit musty and should be replaced. And the carpark!!!!!! If you drive anything bigger than a dodgem car then you're gonna have fun here.

The big positives:

- The Macs in the room serving as a tv and internet access was inspired. Being a tech junkie I really enjoyed playing around with this piece of kit and I hope this is the way most hotels will move. 

- The comfort level of the hotel was exceptional, all the seats and beds were very comfy. 

- The location was close enough to the main train station and the nightlife to make our stay enjoyable. 

The Negative 

- The reception staff seemed bothered that they had to be there to help us, the gentleman who checked me in didn't smile once or even make conversation with me. However it must be said that the lady who checked me out and the gentleman who helped me with my bag were both much friendlier. 

- I was slightly annoyed that I wasn't offered the chance to leave a swipe of my credit card at reception meaning I couldn't order room service or eat breakfast at the hotel. Add to that the fact that my minibar was locked made me feel rather unwelcome. 

- Whilst the macs are excellent they are missing a couple of touches such as the programs not being fully installed on the computers, some programs crashing if another person in the hotel is using them and no tv guide/a minimalist remote meant I had to keep checking the internet to see what I could watch at night. 

I honestly think that I was just unlucky with the chap who checked me in as other members of staff I interacted with were full of smiles.

I would very much recommend the hotel for value for money and comfort, so give it a try I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself.","0","","2009-08-31","2009-09-08","2009-09-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r40129647-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We chose City Inn as they had a £59 per room per night deal on, with breakfast included. The hotel was pretty easy to find, and is a short walk from the train station, and 10 minutes stroll into the city centre. 
The staff were fairly helpful, although some of the party found them a little snotty. (Although we were a hen party, we were not rowdy or loud, so I don't feel we were 'lowering the tone' so to speak!!)
The rooms were well appointed and spotlessly clean, but fairly small, Some friends had larger rooms with kings size beds for the same price, but I think it is just the luck of the draw. The beds were comfortable, and once we worked out the air conditioning, we had a goods nights sleep. As mentioned, the imac system was clever, but a little fiddly if you are used to PC's! The free internet is bonus however. 
The bathroom was tiny, and difficult to get ready/dry in, but the shower was great! 
The highlight for me was the breakfast. Although there is only a cold continental buffet, if you order from the kitchen, the food was lovely - I had smoked salmon, scrambled egg and brioche on the second morning, and the eggs were the best I've ever tasted! The service was friendly, but a bit hit and miss speed wise, so not great if you're in a hurry. The fresh pot of coffee and cute mini bagels were a bonus though!
Overall, a great stay for the price, but I wouldn't pay the normal £80-£100 for this, purely because the rooms are a bit on the small side! Oh, and the parking is not great - very small carpark and £8 per day! A bit cheeky for a 4* hotel I think! I'd definitely book again if they had the same deal on though, for the scrambled eggs if nothing else!","0","","2009-08-31","2009-09-07","2009-09-07","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r39981601-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Wasn't disappointed. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms have iMac computers with free Internet access and good TV/radio. Good location. But overall - great value for money!

Negatives - car park is very small (and very expensive) and the rooms are on the small side too (shower rooms are tiny).

The check inn had some problems, they took a while finding my reservation and I genuinely had trouble understanding the receptionist's accent. 

Nevertheless, going into the room I was impressed. It struck me as being very serene and clean if you can call it that. Very beige though. Looking through the cupboards and shelves I was impressed, there was plenty of space and it all seemed well thought through. The Mac computer doubling as the TV was a definate plus. I had booked the hotel only a few days ago as my whole trip came unexpectedly and staying in Bristol was a necessity as I had an early flight from the airport, so the ability to connect online was very welcome.

The view from the window was an office building - no surprise there. The bathroom was very clean and seemed functional enough. Very cramped though and the rail for the hand towel was directly above the toilet seat and somehow it also managed to fall into the toilet. 

Overall I was happy with the room, I got a good night's sleep and all was well. As my stay was really short, I valued the proximity to the railway station (about 200meters or so) and the nice bed. However, in the morning around 5am I had to catch the first bus to the airport and the receptionist took a really long time. Given that I had paid in advance and didn't use the minibar I had to rush him and he only then cleared me to go. Again, not something I would have even paid attention to had I been on a holiday and not in a hurry but given that I was on a business trip I would have valued efficiency in the reception.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2d/38/25/beige-but-very-clean.jpg","2009-04-30","2009-06-11","2009-06-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r32099096-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I'd give the restraunt a pass if I were you, but everything else was amazing!
As others have said, the free internet was a plus. Clean, great location if you're taking a train in or a plane out, as they are a few minutes walk from the bus route and Temple Meads.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2c/d3/09/cot-they-added-to-our.jpg

The bathroom had an excellent shower (no bath)and was very clean and modern. The only downsides were a slightly firm bed, only one bathrobe for 2 people and the small size of the room (+ the £8 parking charge!). The excellent feature for us was the cafe bar and the restaurant. Arriving mid-afternoon, we had a snack in the cafe bar (excellent) and then ate later in the restaurant. The restaurant meal, and service, was quite exceptional for a hotel of this kind and we enjoyed it very much. We would certainly choose this hotel again if staying in Bristol.","0","","2009-05-31","2009-05-30","2009-05-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r31170880-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We stayed here as hotels in Bath were too expensive  and managed to get a room at the City Inn and breakfast for £59 which was excellent value especially considering the hotel's impressive facilities. Our room had air con, a very good shower and an iMac system that you can watch TV on and use the internet for free. We liked the modern simple decor and found the bed really comfy. 

Incidentally, the lady on reception was exceptionally helpful!

The only negative about our stay was the breakfast. We had to queue to sit down and the service was rather harassed and panicky, we think maybe they were understaffed so this may have been an exception. The breakfast itself was very nice.","0","","2009-05-31","2009-05-17","2009-05-17","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r30126836-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Service: 5","Great location, clean rooms + iMac computer in room with free internet access!","I am a solo traveller and paid under £60 for a room at City Inn Bristol and thought it was a fantastic value for money experience.

This hotel is literally under 5 minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station, making it a VERY convenient position. Also the Bristol airport 'International Flyer' is the only express link between Bristol Railway Station (Temple Meads), Bristol Bus Station, Clifton and Bristol International Airport. The journey time to the City Centre is approximately 30 minutes, so those with flights can also benefit.

Firstly the reception workers were very friendly and professional and my room was spotlessly clean. But what I found to be a massive plus point is that the room has a iMac entertainment system - this is your TV (with freeview channels), DVD player, radio but the big bonus of being a fully functional internet system - so if you either have time to kill or just need information, check emails, deal with ebay sales or even check facebook (!) then this is a fantastic bonus to have in your room and the surfing is free! Business people can also deal with files and save them to memory sticks and there are printing facilities available. The system also has iTunes if you need to use your CDs while working.
I know most people don't go to hotels to use computers, but personally when I've come back from an evening out, I am rarely ever wanting to go straight to sleep, or if I've got an hour before a meeting etc, having a free internet terminal in your own room is a brilliant way to use the time.

As for the bed, I found it both very comfortable and very warm. In many hotels of this kind of pricing, I have found the duvets can often be a little thin. But at City Inn Bristol they were thick enough so that I didn't wake up feeling cold even once during the night.

It was also a pleasure to find the shower both roomy (where you stand) and powerful.

The breakfast was included in my tariff and was a buffet style offering both hot and cold options (including cereal, scrambled egg, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausages, bacon etc). I had toast (choice of white or brown) along with tea, but they have several fruit juices as well. Although other hotels nearby have had a larger selection of items, I found it perfectly adequate and was full when I finished. I did forget to ask if the eggs were free range (the only thing I'm picky about food-wise).

I didn't have a car, so although there is parking available, I don't know what the costs are etc.

Pros:

*Under 5 mins walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station

*Having a computer with free internet access in the hotel room was fantastic both for information and a time killer (I was able to manage my ebay sales away from home)

*Very clean rooms and good bedding

*Freeview digital TV channels

*Double-glazed room - you can hardly hear a thing from outside when you shut the windows - always good when trying to sleep!

Cons:

*I honestly can't think of anything I didn't like. I suppose the outside of the building looks bland for a hotel - but this is hardly a negative!

I think I have found my new fave hotel in Bristol. Being a few mins walk from the main city station is great (which also means you're about 10 minutes walk from the town centre). But the stand out factor for me was not having to bring a laptop or mess around with my mobile phone to get at my emails. Instead I was able to use the iMac internet terminal while drinking coffee in my hotel room :)","0","","2009-05-31","2009-05-13","2009-05-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r29937693-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The staff on check in gave a great service, very friendly and efficient. The rooms were also very clean and have amazing Imac systems with complimentary internet!! Although slightly on the small side they still had everything needed.

I did not use the restaurant as went out with friends although I did use the bar. The bar itself was small and not particularly lively, even the music was too low for any major atmosphere but the staff were outstanding. My girlfriend wanted cocktails so we asked for the list which was fairly extensive. The bar manager, Mike i believe, knew all the cocktails without looking and even taught us how to make them, and even did a little show just like the film. 

I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if you enjoy your cocktails.

The only downside is the car park, hardly any spaces with 24 hours for £8.50?! Should be maximum £3.50 in my eyes!!

Thankyou to all the staff, especially Mike in the bar and Jamie in reservations for the help.","0","","2009-04-30","2009-04-21","2009-04-21","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r28477557-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Generally it's a good hotel however we've obviously been spoilt by the Westminster branch as the Bristol one is nowhere near as good!

Rooms - Smallish but clean and comfortable.  We only really used it as a base for exploring the city (and shops!) and it was great for this.  The shower in the bathroom was great and definitely made up for the lack of bath!  The iMac was brilliant - excellent for TV and music, plus internet access was useful

Location - Excellent location which meant everything was easily accessible.  There are lots of restaurants to try locally and the shopping was fantastic.

Food - We had room service breakfast one day.  Although the portions were generous as a whole it was disappointing - we were missing items we'd requested and for some reason we were only given cutlery and crockery for 1 when we'd ordered for 2!  Not worth the price we paid, particularly as there's an italian restaurant just past the church at the back of the hotel which does a much nicer breakfast for half the price! 

Service - We were disappointed with the service, particularly as the staff in the Westminster branch are so lovely.  Staff here were indifferent and hurried (maybe not enough of them as it was busy that weekend).  We asked for a lightbulb which had blown to be changed and were very unhelpfully told they might manage it that evening but that they didn't think there were any lightbulbs in the hotel....  However it had been changed when we got back

Car Parking - £8 per 24 hours.  We paid for the convenience of having the car nearby and somewhere secure(ish)  The car park is VERY small and it's a first come first served basis.  Expect to be parked in!","1","","2009-03-31","2009-04-10","2009-04-10","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r27756540-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I had to wait to check in as the receptionist kept answering the phone and ignoring me.  He seemed a little flustered and not particularly professional.

The room looked nice and was very clean but there was too much furniture in it for  the size, making it feel very cramped.  Saying that though, the furnishings were nice and modern.

I liked the imac entertainment system but it did not seem to remember volume settings and varied considerably with each channel.

The free WIFI was a plus but I guess the cost of this is covered in the high room rate.

The biggest let down was the bathroom.  Absolutely tiny and and an ugly, dirty looking green sink.  The power shower was difficult to use and lacked any power.  The temperature was either too hot or too cold, so it was not at all pleasant.

Parking was £7.50 per night and I feel that this should be included in the room rate.

Lots of quibbles though which begin to add up - the first room I was given had been smoked in so I had to move, in the next room, two table lamps were on the blink.  The mattress was very soft and squishy - too much so for my back.  The ""free wifi throughout the hotel"" did not work in my room.  I spent over 20 minutes on the phone to the support number given, who were unable to resolve the problem and suggested the problem was probably with the access point nearest to my room.  On reporting this to reception they were willing to resolve this for me by moving me (again) or by providing me with a cable for the cable broadband (cable not supplied as a matter of course, which would have been preferable) but they showed zero interest in addressing this as a systemic problem - so avoid the 2nd floor if wifi matters to you.  Finally on checking my bill a day later I found I had been billed for my call to the telephone support number - they don't even make that a freephone number.  On calling back and pointing out that I shouldn't have to pay for trying to get the ""free wifi"" to work, this was refunded, but that final irritation has driven me to write this review.  This was my second stay at the City Inn and the second time out of two that I have had problems with the wifi.

Large with plenty of storage space, a big bathroom with a powerful shower. The whole place was immaculate; the bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows and extra blankets if needed. There were little extras like wine glasses, a proper ironing board and little biscuits which were much appreciated. However, the piece-de-resistance has got to be the entertainment system! The TV/computer/DVD player combo was ingenious. All the channels available as well which was great!

Location was brilliant, only a short 5 min walk from all the action. Also the temple-meads station is a 3 minute walk away – the bus from the airport stops here and is much cheaper than a taxi (only £8 rtn) Hotel staff were lovely and very helpful with any of our questions.

The room was big with nice furnishings.  The bathroom was very spacious with a massive shower.  I liked having a Mac in my room with access to the internet, being away from home on my own, having access to Facebook and Ebay helped me to while away the time!
The rooms and bathroom were spotlessly clean and cannot be faulted.  
The restaurant had a great menu and I was able to have a great deal of choice during my stay.  With a large glass of wine my evening meal cost me between £25 and £30 for three courses.  The wine menu was quite good too.  Breakfast was of a very high standard although the full English could have been a little fuller but there was so much else to fill up on.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The hotel location is good within close proximity to the Temple Meads development and all the lovely new shops, including Harvey Nichols.  The shops are open until 8pm so after a days worth of business you can do some browsing too in order to relax.
Parking cost £7 a day which was a little steep but I suppose it is a city centre and it's aimed more at the business traveller.
A lovely stay and if I was to come to Bristol for pleasure I would consider staying here.","0","","2008-10-31","2008-12-23","2008-12-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r22940661-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

BUT from the first impression to the last it was a fantastic stay - and actually made being away from home for a night very enjoyable.

The room was great - especially the I-mac and great power shower and the food from room service was exceptional (try the fish and chips)

The menu in the hotel restaurant looked pretty good for dinner.  The breakfast was OK but there was an enormous queue so it took a while to be seated.  In fact I think this place suffers due to it's popularity as there was also a big queue for check-out.

Saying that the staff were great, the facilities in the room - especially the computer / tv - unexpected and welcome.

I'd definitely stay in a City Inn rather than consider it's competitors in this price range.","0","","2008-07-31","2008-11-11","2008-11-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r21732832-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

One little moan is that our 'double room' was 2 single beds pushed together, so there was a ridge in the middle. The iMac was great, TV, DVDs, free internet access - very impressed. Bathroom was small but did the job nicely. We had dinner there too, which was very good. 3 courses is the right amount as they aren't huge portions. Well presented and tasty food. Breakfast was very good. Choice of cereal, fruit, yogurts, croissiants, pain au chocolate on the buffet, then cooked options are english breakfast, or I went for the kippers - delicious! Overall, a very enjoyable stay. I would stay there again, and recommend it to my friends.","0","","2008-10-31","2008-10-27","2008-10-27","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r21282875-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Breakfast was good with plenty of continental breakfast choice and freshly prepared cooked items. 

Location is about 10 minutes walk from centre of the city.

Parking in hotel car park or in a nearby pay and display which is free overnight.  As a solo female traveller I was a little worried about parking there beforehand in case it was a dark and creepy multistory but it was open air, well lit and just a few steps from the hotel entrance so felt safe and secure even arriving late at night.

The bathrooms are clean, small with no bath but with a great shower.

We were meeting family in Bristol and they only had a budget for a B&B. However we booked 3 rooms for 2 nights for £300 total, far cheaper than most B&Bs that they were looking at. 

The parking used to be free but now they charge, but the hotel is still excellent value overall. Also one of our party is disabled so the staff made sure that a disabled space was always available for them, and also made sure that they were well looked after.

We will continue to stay at the City Inn as it gives us the comfort we require for a bargain price in a convenient location.","0","","2008-07-31","2008-10-11","2008-10-11","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r20800182-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Firstly, the hotel is in a perfect position. 5 minute walk from the train station, 10 minute walk to the new shopping Mall. There are lots of pubs and restaurants close by. 
   
The hotel is very modern and the rooms are clean and spacious. Our room had a large double bed with excellent quality bedding. Tea and coffee facilities in the room with a well stocked mini bar. An Apple computer system giving free unlimited internet access and quality sound system in each room. Satellite TV and a free DVD library also available at no extra cost.
     
There is an excellent restaurant on site with a top class menu and wine list. If you fancy something a little less formal you can choose food from the bar menu, which again, was very good quality. All the staff seemed very friendly and nothing was to much trouble, which gave us the impression of it being a 'happy ship'.
   
If we visit Bristol again we would return to the City Inn and we would also be tempted to try one of their other venues up and down the country. Overall, great value for money.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/1b/7f/ef/modern-room.jpg

I'd certainly use it again but my advice would be to forget the hotel restaurant (breakfast is excellent by the way), walk out of the rear doors, across the small park and at the 't' junction look left at the Dolce Vita- a lovely owner run italian cafe/restaurant. The food here is lovely- freshly prepared, good quality and very reasonably priced (under £15 for two courses including a drink)

To the right of this T junction is the Kings Head pub- one of the oldest in Bristol. Landlord run and straight out of a film set (literally- it's been used in several films) it's all oak booths, brass and etched glass- but the real deal not a modern imitation. Oh- and the beers lovely. IF YOU ARE FROM OVERSEAS THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY CHNCE YOU'LL GET TO SEE A 'REAL' British pub.

The hotel I'd recommend to anyone really- but take that short walk and you'll not regret it","2","","2008-09-30","2008-09-13","2008-09-13","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r20029517-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

For once it was a warm english summer weekend but unfortuntely this would somewhat spoil our stay as the air con in our room was not working, spoiling our sleep somewhat.  There was quite a lot of road noise which meant having the window open was a prrblem also.  We mentioned the aircon problem at reception a couple of times but no solution was offered.

The room as with all city inns was nice and the bathroom a little small but with a great shower and nice smellies.  I do wish City Inns would omit the small table in the rooms though as the rooms are just not big enough and makes them look cluttered.

As others have said the hotel is convenient for Temple Meads station a 5 to 10 min walk away.

The car park is at extra cost but busy and gets full - theres alternative pay and display (free at night) nearby though.  The hotel seemed relaxed about charging for the parking.

Overall not upto the usual standards of City Inn but a one off i hope.","2","","2008-08-31","2008-09-06","2008-09-06","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r19832484-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Cardiff is a hour way by coach . which stops about 5 minute walk from Stadium.
Cardiff hotels were all booked up and Bristol was the nearest alternative city . Flew into Bristol airport with Ryanair and the City Inn  hotel is conveniently with a  bus stop outside which is on the ""Flyer Coach"" route between Airport and City centre about 20-25 minutes from airport. (Note - Very handy ...) 
Local bus service  also bring you into city centre (or its about a 10 minute walk). 

Receptionists were very friendly and efficient and also very knowledgeable about the local area etc. I always have a lot of questions to ask to find my way around .. 

Hotel is located in the business district and is a quiet area especially on the bank holiday weekend. A little passing traffic outside but not very noisy 

Rooms were comfortable and clean ..really impressed with the Apple iMac in the room ..Television , Radio , Internet Access etc..
Warning : volume is very loud when turned on initially ...really loud.

Full English Breakfast at £12 was good and we had that both days . We did not eat in the restaurant but did have a lovely snack in the bar.

Again ..very good value and ideally located if you dont have a car..

Would highly recommend ..","0","","2008-08-31","2008-08-28","2008-08-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r19459582-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We got a room at the front of the building, not too large, contemporary in design, clearly aimed at business travellers. The hotel is on a busy thoroughfare but a double set of double glazed windows blocks off the noise of traffic. We did not experience noise from other rooms. 

In room facilities included air con, electronic safe, mini bar, trouser press, tea & coffee making facilities, and a state-of-the-art iMac multimedia entertainment system with digital TV, CD and DVD player, and free broadband Internet. Great fun! The bathroom was small, very small, with shower only, hairdryer, and some basic complimentary toiletries. 

Our discounted rate (booked online through Alpha Rooms) included full breakfast, and while we felt the quality of the products cooked to order (eggs, bacon and sausages) was rather average, we really enjoyed the continental buffet: cereal, yoghurts, fruit and fruit juice, cheese and meat cuts, smoked salmon, and a selection of pastries..

There were a few more 'luxuries' you don't expect like the white company toiletries and bath robes. The bed was comfortable, the staff were friendly and the room/shower room were of a good size and clean. Plus there was easy parking which is free overnight from 6pm to 8am and £1 per hour thereafter (which you can pay the night before so no getting up early).

Someone must have informed the hotel that it was my birthday as on arrival there was a decent bottle of wine and a card from the manager wishing me a happy birthday and a pleasant stay.

The rooms were kitted out well and even had an apple computer which you can watch satellite and use for internet access at no extra charge. The bed was so comfy and had a better mattress than my own at home. We ate lunch in the hotel restaurant the following day and enjoyed both the food and the size of the portions.

On the night of my birthday I stayed up late and still got served at around 1o'clock in the morning and found the barman to be very friendly although drinks were quite expensive but I guess you expect this in a hotel bar.
I really enjoyed visiting Bristol as there was plenty to do. We walked into the centre which is about 5mins and never used the car until we checked out. We didn't see all that Bristol offers so I'm certain I will be returning to Bristol and the City Inn again in future.","0","","2008-07-31","2008-07-18","2008-07-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r18010574-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

A friend and I stayed here as a base to go and see a concert at Ashton Gate Stadium (only a £5 taxi ride away).

The reception staff were friendly and helpful.  Our room was pretty much as expected; clean and modern and included a mini bar and snacks, bath robes, ironing board and iron, corkscrew!, good multi media facilities and a nice walk in power shower.

The only negatives for me were that the tv was set to come on at a thousand decibels and when you finally turned it down the lowest volume level still made you wince!  And the car parking charges at £7.50 per day - I think thats a bit steep for a hotel car park! 

Nevertheless it's a great little modern hotel with good amenities, and fairly close to the train station.  I'd probably stay again at the right price.","0","","2008-06-30","2008-06-30","2008-06-30","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r17362614-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Arrived 17:00 on a sunday eve, the hotel was very quiet, and we got parked in the hotel car park, if it is busy you have to park down the road which is not ideal.
Checkin was quick and easy, but he girl on the front desk hardly said a word, didnt even get a smile, so not a great welcome by any means.
Our room was on the 1st floor, was small but had everything you could want, mini bar, lcd T.V, comfy dble bed and arm chair. The bathroom was tiny, and had hardly any toiletries, the ""fluffy"" bathrobes were far from ""fluffy"" and looked like they had been worn a million times! Our window would not shut properly and the room was not spotless as you would expect. I dont think any money had been spent on the hotel since it first opend and in my opinion it was looking a little tired compared to our previous stay.
We booked through hotel website a month in advance, we paid £49 which was a good price and i have to recomend it at that price.
Theres alot of hotels in Bristol and many near to this one, I would not put anybody off if you can get it at the right price, but anything more that £60 id look elsewhere","0","","2008-05-31","2008-06-03","2008-06-03","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r16639251-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Being a female traveller on my own I ordered room service & the starter & main course were mouthwatering which is so unusual for a city centre chain hotel, well done City Inns.

Another amazing thing - the express pick up breakfast for £3.50 - a coffee and a bacon or sausage roll or muffin or fruit salad.  That's what every hotel should be doing.  We don't all want to sit down & pay mega money for a plate of heart attack food.  Can't congratulate them enough on this innovative idea at such a great price.

I'll be recommending this place to all my fellow travellers & all for the price of £92 per night.","0","","2008-05-31","2008-05-28","2008-05-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r16471560-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Whilst the hotel doesn't offer the last word in luxury, it does offer the business traveller a plain and simple bolt-hole when spending time in Bristol (or the surrounding area).  The rooms are clean and tidy, with a minimalist feel, therefore helping you unwind at the end of another stressful day.

Being a light sleeper, I'm particularly impressed with the sound proofing between rooms......this is one of the only hotels I've stayed in where I've not been disturbed by other guests.  Moreover, having an aircon system that actually works (which is rare in Bristol) also helps to provide a comfortable night's sleep in summer months.

The food is good (although a little more choice would be welcome), whether being served in the restaurant or as room-service.

As highlighted in previous reviews, the old TV's were a little on the small size.  However, these have now been replaced by iMac's which are great.  Not only do they provide a great quality TV picture, they provide full PC capabilities including the internet.

All in all a great hotel.","0","","2008-05-31","2008-05-20","2008-05-19","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r16226790-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

My tip would be not to eat or drink at the hotel if you can avoid it. Prices are on the steep side, and you can do better in Bristol centre which is only a walk away.

When I was there a couple of hen and stag parties decided that 4 a.m. was a good time to party outside my room door, but the hotel is not to blame for that. Be warned though, that this is the business they seem to be in.

Other than that, fine and cheaper overall than the Premier Inn/Traellodge alternatives.","0","","2008-04-30","2008-04-25","2008-04-25","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r15349268-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Things to look out for:
  * Scuff marks on the walls throughout giving it a tired feel. This was more noticeable above the level of the reception.
  * Stained and tired carpets in the walkways and bedrooms
  * The worlds smallest bathroom...sorry shower room (there is no bath). Swinging a kitten would be out of the question.
  * Prices for food. They are obviously very proud of their restaurant and what they consider to be the quality of their food but it is not worth London style prices. The menu is overly pretentious, complete with 'jus' and 'poche'. I had fish and chips with mushy peas...don't ask me to repeat what it was called on the menu. The Fish was about the size of a packet of cigarettes, and had soggy batter, the Chips were served stacked at right angles (I counted 8 chips) and were brown but soggy and not cooked in the middle, the Peas were nice. Also, the same set menu was served for Lunch and Dinner...exactly the same food, on the same plates...but when served in the evening it was about £7 more expensive for 2 courses.
  * Room charges. I was charged £109 a night for 2 nights being Monday and Tuesday. The reception staff made a mess of charging my card, (which didn't need a PIN number or signature, they just swiped it), and when I came to check out and pay for my parking £15 for two nights, I was told that the room prices had changed from when I paid, it was now £20 more expensive. I refused to pay it, and they graciously took it off. It wouldn't suprise me to see it on my statement in the near future.
  * The smallest TV in the world. The TV in the room was smaller than the monitor on my computer at work. It was only just bigger than my laptop screen. Watching the football from on the bed was only made bearable by the fact that the room was so small that the bed and the TV were almost touching. The channels on the TV were suitable for lonely businessmen. The location of the CBBC channel and the unrestricted Playboy channel (with no warning or parental control) made me wonder how many awkward conversations have been had in this hotel with children about 'wrestling'.
  * Old mattresses and bedding stored in alcoves by the lifts. I hadn't seen this sort of thing in a hotel in years, let alone one that charges over £100 a night in Bristol.
  * The Double bed that I booked was two singles pushed together, and the cheap mattresses had thick seams around the edge that meant that lieing in the middle of the bed was very uncomfortable.

On the plus side the bar seemed popular with locals, the service in the bar and restaurant were pretty good, the food was OK. It just didn't live up to it's own pretentions or the price.","0","","2008-04-30","2008-04-23","2008-04-23","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r15250681-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I stayed 2 nights and had a superb stay.  The reception is modern and airy - the staff that checked me in were pelasant and polite.  The room was small and situated at the rear overlooking a small park - my colleague stayed at the front and said the road noise was a little noisy from 6.30am but was ok with the window closed.  The room was extremely clean and well designed with excellent modern neutral furniture, a very comfortable mattress, the dvd/cd player was excellent - I brought some with me to watch - so no charge for ""box office"" like other hotels.  It had a mini bar - which was expensive - but that was no surprise.  The showerroom was excellent, clean, modern and had ""the white company"" toiletries.  Excellent quality.  I had breakfast both mornings and dinner in the restaurant on the first night.  The service was as per a 5 star hotel - superb - the food was stunning - slightly pricey from the a la carte - but well worth it as the company was paying.  The downside is there is nothing nearby - ie restaurants, shops, newsagent etc - so you would have to drive - the dock area being the best place for choice.  The hotel carpark is small so dont be surprised if you cant get a space but there is another public carpark at the rear.  There is a lot of building work all around Bristol but none really encroached on the hotel during my stay.  If I stay in Bristol again I will certainly stay in this hotel.  As a final note - the fitness room - it made me laugh it is one of the bedrooms made into a fitness suite - one runnign maching, one bike machine, a weights station and a tv - so its quite cosy!!!!!  You get to know your fellow fitness geeks very quickly - make sure you put on extra deoderant!","1","","2008-03-31","2008-04-05","2008-04-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r14812331-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Unfortunately, with the current building work going on around the hotel, there is no real benefit to staying here.  I would suggest the Jurys or Marriott as being better placed for the pleasant side of Bristol.  Staff were terrible - basically young kids who didn't speak good English or seem particularly interested in being helpful.  Car park was full and we were told to park at the multi-storey nearby, and move the car in the morning.  To be fair, the website states that there is limited parking so we expected this. Didn't expect that when a spot became free it would cost £7.  No breakfast included, so not good value for money.  In short, if you want a pleasant room to lay your head, the City Inn is fine.

We're still waiting to see if we do get our money back, but irrespective of that the inconvenience to some of our party of having nearly £300 disappear unnecessarily from their bank accounts for a week is bad for the cash flow and leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.

Check-in / front desk: 1","Farcical and not to be recommended","I phoned the hotel on a Friday to get a room for the Saturday night and was offered a deal of £69 or £89 for a ""slightly larger room"", a fruit platter and luxury toiletries.  We live in Manchester where a very smart new City Inn has opened - we've have drinks in the very smart cocktail bar a couple of times and have seen the rooms and know they are fairly small.  On arriving the room didn't seem like it could possibly have been any smaller though so I phoned reception to check and was told that all rooms are the same size.  This confirms an earlier reviewer who complained abour staff not knowing the packages they were selling.  

The fruit platter was quite good though and ended up saving us money that we would have spent in the restaurant on dinner and so I forgot about the misselling of the room size.  The location is quite good and it is just a short walk to the city centre and a very short drive from the motorway network.

Small niggles like the tv not working properly and only one towel in the bathroom added to the list of complaints.

Breakfast was quite good but was buffet and some things were looking a little tired (I'm talking about the food not the guests).  The worst though was the farce of the room entry card not working and still not working having taken it back to reception 4 times - our room was on first floor close to the stairs so this was just annoying - totally unacceptable if we'd been further away.  To make matters worse the same dozy receptionist didnt give us a code number to exit the car park even though I'd just told her we had a car there.

There does seem to be a consistency to the recent reviews - the rooms are small and there will be something major wrong with the hotel.

On top of this the building is fairly ugly.

Food ok, not exactly special the location is not very good either. Also we booked two rooms and only one was available (because we turned up late.)

They basically said the error was ours and showed us a screen print. Actually when we got back to the office our travel dept dug out the “real” reservation and it seems they messed up the booking.

8.30pm and my colleague had to hunt down a room in Bristol for the night.

We booked this time for a one-night dinner, bed and breakfast offer which was extremely good value and included a bottle of wine, room with dvd/cd player, hairdryer, tea-making facilities, iron/ironing board, mini-bar and bathrobes for the bargain price of  £99.00 for the two of us. 

Check-in was great, and the girl on the desk was very friendly and extremely professional.

We enjoyed the 'White Company'  toiletries which were large, wall-mounted, and full.  This was in addition to the usual small bottles of shampoo/conditioner, etc.  

It appeared that the rooms had recently been refurbished, as the information sheet stated that the hairdryer was in the drawer under the tv set, when in fact it was in a bag in the wardrobe - (This I found out only when I phoned down to complain)!

The toilet roll holder was loose, yes, but really I would be nit-picking to complain about these minor details, when the rest of the room and the service was of such a high standard.

The food was very good, service impeccable, and the menu quite varied for dinner.  

The following morning we had not just 'continental, or cereals and ""full english""; but a better than average choice - in fact all you could wish for, including fresh fruit salad and smoked salmon and scrambled eggs on toasted brioch, kippers, etc.

We left very happy and relaxed, and yes, we will be back!","0","","2007-12-31","2008-01-02","2008-01-02","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r12272408-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Reception was quick, efficient and friendly, and the room was nice, if a bit small. The bathroom was really small but everything you needed was there.
Bed was big and comfy. The only thing we found strange was the many light switches for the lamps etc. There were loads and seemed to turn some lights on and some off! Bit confusing after a night out.

However, a few things disappointed us.  We noticed were that there was no hand soap in the bathroom.  The liquid soap dispenser had been removed from the wall.  We couldn't get access to the mini bar because it was locked.  We called reception who sent someone up to investigate and after a short delay, provided us with soap and a key to the fridge.  The room was small (but we didn't expect it to be large).  During the night, we heard other doors opening and closing as the refurb hadn't included 'noise free' door close features which is standard in many hotels these days.  The most disappointing aspect was the breakfast - full buffet style (unlike Manchester which provided cook to order on hot food).  The eggs, bacon etc on the buffet were cold and unappetising.  Tea was served in the teapot the size of an eggcup and toast came in very small portions for two people.  We wouldn't stay at this branch of the City Inn again - it really seemed like the 'poor relation' to its siblings in London and Manchester.  Don't understand why this hotel has in not of the same standard when they are all supposed to be 4 star.","0","","2007-11-30","2007-11-12","2007-11-12","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r10766513-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The modern compact rooms are OK for one traveler but crowded for two, the bathroom is very small with only a shower.  Soap is in dispensers; on one visit neither of the two dispensers would pump any soap.  For two days I dismantled them to get the soap out but the staff didn't have the savvy to realise that they didn't work and just kept putting them back together. 
The rooms were refurbished recently although that didn't improve things much.  Simple problems become annoying when there is always something wrong - I don't expect to keep asking for obvious things to be made available such as, no coat hangers, no TV remote, DVD wasn't connected to the TV, safe locked by previous guest and inaccessible, no complimentary beverage.
The restaurant serves expensive micro cuisine - don't eat here if you’re hungry.
I received a very pert letter following one visit demanding 65 pence for a minibar item that I didn’t take – would you risk upsetting a client for this amount of money?
The hotel seems to lack management setting any exacting standards.  
I now stay at the Marriott when I am in Bristol – a far better option for the same price.","1","","2007-05-31","2007-10-31","2007-10-31","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r10482615-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

We got a fairly good deal which also included breakfast.  The bedrooms are contemporary style, with TV dvd player and stereo, and tea/coffee making facilities and minibar.  The bedroom was fairly compact as was the bathroom (shower only - no bath) but it was sufficient for our stay.  The bed was comfortable and the room quiet.  We stayed in room 112 overlooking the churchyard at the back.

The location was good - a brisk 10 minute walk into Broadmead shopping centre, and also a short walk to the centre/Park Street area.  Being in the business end of town it was probably quieter than being right in Bristol city centre.  There is a bus stop in front of the hotel which goes regularly to Clifton/Whiteladies Road (bus numbers 8 and 9) so we took this option rather than a more expensive taxi.

Parking at the hotel was fine - we paid £7.50 per day to leave the car there and then just explored Bristol on foot.

Breakfast was good - a buffet style continental and cooked breakfast.  The hotel was busy but they had quite a few staff on and kept things moving.

Overall, I was pleased with this hotel and could quite easily have stayed a few more days!","1","","2007-10-31","2007-10-09","2007-10-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r10057703-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

W/c 10th Sept back in the hotel with work for another 4 nts. Check in was fine again. Room 135 - went and unpacked only to find out the internet not working - David helped again but advised me to change rooms - so changed to 140 across the hall.
After unpacking again surveyed the room to find wine stain on carpet, toilet roll holder and soap holder coming away from the walls, no desk lamp and no CD player - not too bothered about CD player as don't use them. 
Made reception aware of the problems - nothing can be done about the desk lamp or the carpet - soap and toilet holder both fixed

By Thurs starting to get sick of the posh menu and craving some normal food. On the menu it says if there is something you want but it is not on the menu just ask -so I did and wish I didn't.
Ordered room service and got the Chef Peter who was rude and aggressive. He said they did not do that and if they had prior warning then maybe get something else in but would need 10 days notice! All I asked was could I get a burger or something like that - I had the lamb burger last wk and was not keen on all the spices and chillies in it I just wanted something plain!
I told him fine don't worry and ordered the omlette which I have just had and was lovely all though having worked in hotel restaurants years ago when at Uni, was probably spat in or something - maybe not - who knows!
The one excellent thing on the menu is the cheese and biscuits which are homemade oat cakes and taste gorgeous!

As for Peter well next time I am in Bristol for the wk with work I will
look into other hotels - hey they may not be so upper class but at least they may be friendly

Stay in rm 140 at your peril!

The rooms are very nice as other comments have said, very modern with good facilities, but would agree the bathroom was too small. We booked two twin rooms on the same floor for our stay and when we arrived  the only twin rooms they had were on different floors so we ended up with two doubles, luckly we've known each other for years!! 

The hotel is modern and clean and the front of house staff are very pleasent so no complaints there.

We went into the bar for a drink before we went out but it was very dark and not very inviting, also drinks were expensive but we were only staying for one so no big deal.

The main complaint is the breakfast which we paid for as part of our stay. We got down to breakfast very early ont eh first morning and there was hardly anyone there. We ordered two cooked breakfasts and two toast and cerial. The toast and cerial was fine but after waiting over half an hour for the two cooked breakfast, which we were told 3 time were on there way we walked out with out it as we had plans for the day.

The next morning it was a bit later so it was a lot busier, this time we did get our cooked breakfasts but some of the order was wrong, one person ordered fried egg but it came out scrammbled, but not your usual scrammbled egg, it was a funny orange colour and looked really soggy and wet, not white and fluffy like it should be. She sent it back and it never re-appeared so she went without the breakfast she'd paid for two days in a row.
I think they are trying to hard to be a posh resturant when they don't have the man power to support that.

One last thing is the parking, £7.50 for 24hours is a bit steep when your already paying to stay there, but there are cheaper car parks just minutes from the hotel, there is one just aroud the back.

All in all the hotel is very nice and the beds are lovely and big, the rooms are well looked after and very clean, the only thing that lets it down is the food.

Business service (e.g., internet access): 3","Falls short of its boastful web pages.","As a business traveller I spend most of the week in various hotels around the country. Some large chains and many independents. We chose this hotel for a weekend family break based upon competitive pricing and it's apparently good reviews, a sort of busman’s holiday if you like.

The rooms are a modern contemporary design, clean and well serviced. The room sizes and in particular the shower room are very small compared to those of most hotel chains, the layout being a little unconventional. The wardrobe is in a far corner which makes access difficult and there is nowhere to land and unpack a case, except either the cluttered floor of the crisp white duvet. If you have two cases you will be falling over them constantly. The promised champagne upon arrival did not materialise. This is included in the 'Lazy Sundays' package.

The bar is functional but its design is not welcoming. Whilst attempting to be cutting edge contemporary, and yes it is very smart, all ambience is lost. There were twenty or so people in the bar and we still had a long wait for a barman to appear. After the small party at the bar decided to move on, the floor of the whole bar area was mopped down around us whilst we sat and watched at 5pm, even though they clearly left no mess. We spent our beer tokens elsewhere.

Breakfast was disappointing. Most disappointing was the cost. With the Lazy Sundays package, there is no breakfast, only a buffet lunch, and incredibly breakfast is charged extra. Presumably we late risers don't expect to eat.

After speaking with the Manager it would appear that something different is on offer to the weekday business clients which is odd. During the weekends the food is buffet style. There was no toast on offer; it is cooked on request and badly at that. Slightly warmed and soggy bread is not toast, I prefer to toast my own, and several guests complained. The entire full English menu was dried up and the serving implements confused and messy. Scrambled eggs cooked with cream were peculiar and very spicy sausages are not to many people’s taste either, it would seem. The restaurant manager was receptive to comments but didn't actually offer to put right any of the issues raised which was a missed opportunity. Instead I was referred to front of house again.

Now, the most annoying part of having to complain is when none of the staff even know the contents of their own package deals.
Three people, two managers and front of house do not know the pricing structure at all. A follow up phone call during the week to the duty manager confirmed this; again, they clearly have no idea what they are selling.

We took a 'Lazy Sundays' upgrade (£110) at a cost of £45 over a standard room only rate of £65. B&B was being charged at £69.

Now, here is the anomaly. 
With this package there is no included breakfast only a buffet Sunday lunch which retails at £18.50 per head (£37 /couple)
So, in effect you are paying £8 more for this 'deal' than if you booked a room only and lunch separately. 
Bizarre? Yes, even the staff thought so.

Apparently you can have breakfast instead of the lunch but as this is clearly valued at £4 per head why on earth would you do this? No breakfast is going to cost you £18.50 per head, so it's simply ludicrous to suggest this as an option.

Personally, having a checkout time of 2.5hrs later, a tiny box of cheap chocolates and a glass of champagne (even if it had arrived) would not encourage me to pay the extra £8.

I can’t wait for next week where myself, and my daily business, return the known quality and no nonsense approach of the Intercontinental Hotel group (Holiday Inn). Not always perfect, but at least they do try.

Overall, it was a very nice hotel.  The staff at reception was quite friendly and helpful.  My room was a good size, very clean.  The bed was very comfortable!  The only downfall of the room was the size of the bathroom - it was very small.  However, it was still nice enough, just a bit difficult to move around in the bathroom.  The hotel offers FREE wireless internet!  I wish all hotels did this!  They also have a nice service - a library of cds and dvds to use in the stereos and dvd players in the guest rooms.  I didn't use this service, so I can't describe it from personal experience, but sounds like a nice idea from what they told me at reception.  The location was good - a short walk from Temple Meads train station (about 5 or 7 minutes).  However, one problem is that there really isn't much directly around the hotel in terms of restaurants, banks, etc.  You really have to walk into town for most of that, which is about a 15 minute walk, I believe.  Not too bad, but a bit of an inconvenience.  The food at the restaurant and through room service was a bit expensive, especially compared with the other 4 star hotel I stayed at for my second night in Bristol.  Overall, a very nice hotel, and I would say you couldn't really go wrong with it.  However, I did prefer the hotel I stayed at the second night... it was the same price for a  bigger room and bathroom, and breakfast included (it was not included at City Inn).

Although we don't know Bristol well, we were able to find the hotel very easily in the car and parking was no problem (be aware they've just introduced a £7.50 /24 hour charge, whereas it used to be free).

Our room on the top floor looked out over the main road but I have to say the soundproofing was great, no exterior noise at all in the room.  We loved the modern decor, very much our taste and the furnishings were all clean and stylish.  Nice, spotlessly clean bathroom with power shower.   Bed very comfortable maybe a bit soft for some people though.

As we were going to a concert at the Academy we decided to eat in the City Cafe bar at 6pm (main restaurant not open until 7pm).  We were the first customers to order food that evening and the chef had just arrived so it took some time for the food to come, but the waitress kept us informed and the food was fantastic when it came, way beyond what you might normally expect in a bar.  Reasonable prices too.

We asked for a late check-out in advance and this was no problem at all.  Breakfast sent up to the room was of a good standard apart from a few minor errors on the order.  

Overall a very relaxing experience and a thoroughly professional set-up.  We would stay here again any time.

Parking – Tight car park to the front & side – get there as soon after 5pm as you can or may not get a space. 

The building – Very modern – air con to rooms. 

Reception & Public areas – Very smart & fresh 

The rooms – Ask for one at the back overlooking the church – if not available then on the front high up is best. Rooms just upgraded so most things are new – very comfy bed – flat screen telly, DVD player; most channels on the TV are free 

The bathroom – Single shower booth enough space for toilet bag – in all well designed 

Food – Very good value in the restaurant – the fixed price menu is interesting combining different tastes – mango ice cream with smoked salmon – sounds terrible but really worked as did the black pepper ice cream. The fixed menu is under £20 so you cannot complain  

Staff – Very professional, friendly – especially in the restaurant 

Over all – Really good hotel as is there branch in Birmingham – book early for a good price. 

Tip – If using express check out make sure you get the exit code for the car park on check in otherwise you will need to queue to get it in the morning.

Unfortunately we asked for a non smoking room but the room we got had definitley had someone smoking in it before we arrived.  The hotel moved us without problem. We had a lovely room with a view over the city.  They are small rooms but as we were out every day it didnt matter.   The hotel is 5 minutes walk from the river which is great for access to all the bars and restaurants - this will be even better when the no smoking rule is brought in in the summer.
the hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great.  Full fry-up or continental buffet - or both (as my husband had).  Definitely a great place to stay if you are in Bristol for the weekend.

A lot of work was also going on at the hotel. Although this did not cause any disruption there was a prominent smell of fresh paint in the lobby and my room.

My room was well sized and well furnished. The only gripe was the bathroom which was tiny and had only a walk in shower. That said it was a power shower which worked well.

I had 4 meals at the hotel. Again in keeping with the brand image this was nouvelle cuisine. It was excellently presented and very tasty, but not exactly hearty fare. I ordered fish and chips one night and it came with square cut chips stacked in a tidy cube shape and the fish resting on a bed of guacamole! You get the idea!

Breakfast were good if again a bit minimalist.

The hotel's claim that they are a 2 minute walk from Temple Meads is a bit optimistic. I am reasonable fit and was carrying a small overnight bag and a laptop. The brisk walk took about 10 minutes. the directions and map could be better too.

The hotel is about a 10 minute walk form the City centre shops.

All in all, a good choice for a business stay. Otherwise it is a question of taste. If you like your hotels modern and minimalist, you will be ok here.

However, on arrival, the staff were friendly and the room was clean and adequate, if a touch on the small side. The shower was easy to manage (often a problem), there were complimentary toiletries and the TV was easy to operate. Someone stole our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign from outside the door on Saturday (very bizarre) and the room key failed to operate on Saturday evening, resulting in having to go downstairs to get it sorted.  Also, they tried to charge for a newspaper that wasn't ordered. The breakfast was pricy (£12.50 for a full cooked breakfast) but it was well delicious if slightly on the small side. No butter on the tables (just marge), I felt they should give you a choice. For a short stay the location is excellent and the hotel is quiet and friendly but the rooms are small if you are staying for longer than a couple of nights.","5","","2007-01-31","2007-01-29","2007-01-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r6712152-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

It's 5 mins walk from Corn St/Queen Square and St Mary Redcliffe. The hotel is modern and the rooms aren't that big but they are well equipped (dvd player, wifi) and comfortable. Service was excellent. We paid £57 a night for the room, which included parking. The location on a dual carriageway looks unpromising but our room was the other side of the hotel and very quiet.. One fun option is to have a trip to Bath, 15 mins away by train. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but the menu looked attractive and the bar food we had (vegetable tempura and chilli chicken) was excellent. Overall we were impressed with the value for money.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with the hotel itself. But the size of the rooms, the location and the prices let it down. The public areas are modern and stylish, the service and bar very nice. But those rooms! It is uncomfortably small. The bathroom is laughably small. The plasma tv and the cd player are lovely touches and the mini-bar 'basket' is very kitsch. Why you would ever want to order room service here is beyond me, I'd get claustrophobic! For a one night stay where you are going out anyway it is fine, but not for a leisure or long stay. At the weekend the rates are much more affordable, esp from other websites, but in the week the rates are astronomical for what you actually get. Not particuarly central or pleasant location either.

Situated in the heart of Temple Quay (Bristol's equivalent to London's docklands). It is contemporary, modern and stylish, and offers the business traveller to the West Country an oasis of chic, contemporary comfort. This would be my number one choice whenever I fly into Bristol. As a French resident, the hotel, and the City Café, offers me everything that I would wish to find in France. The very buzzing City Café, in the capable hands of David Quinion, offers the most imaginative cuisine that one could expect to find in Bristol. Coming from Southern France, I well remember the saddle of rabbit with black pudding on an apple, potato and sage rosti. As I will be back there on 5 November , I hope that he still has it on the menu! If not, I am confident that there will be something to take its place  -   every dish on the menu is a temptation for the tastebuds!

Price:  
I think this hotel is a bargain considering it's in Bristol city centre.  The £10-£20 more I've paid on average to stay here rather that at large budget hotel chains is definitely worth it.

Service:
Always had great service from the staff at the hotel

Room:
Very comfortable, with flatscreen TV, DVD player and movie selection, complementary chocolate biscuits and a good in-room selection of snacks to buy.

The bathroom was small but stylish and modern, great shower, but no bath.  Bath robes are supplied.

Restaurant:
I ate here for the first time this stay and was not disappointed.  I received a voucher on check in for free wine and the 3 course dinner was very very good and not over priced considering the standard.

Location:
Very near the Temple Meads Station and in centre/business district.  

Other:
This City Inn has parking.  There are a few more City Inns around the country.  Don't forget to go and see Bristol's very own ""Leaning Tower"" - Temple Church at the rear of the hotel!

I stayed 5 night in a row and then came back for a following 1 night stay after the weekend. I had the choice when I came for work to Bristol to stay in the Marriot which was closer to the office, however the extras this place offered stole my attention from the airmiles bonus I would have got at the Marriott. 

The City Inn is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from Temple Meads station. If you exit the station via the car park (follow the signs for the ferry) its much quicker than going all the way down to the main road and navigating the roundabouts. 

Check-in was quick and painless. I had a 5th floor garden facing room. The DVD and CD player are fantastic and the LCD TV is so much better than TVs boxed in cupboards that other places do. The best bit was the FREE broadband access. I just plugged my laptop in and away I went. Much better than typing my personal email offline having to wait before I get into the office before sending it on. I felt I could get on with life, even though I was away for work.

The room itself is done out in modern comforting colours. Very smart and upmarket. I liked the comfy chair (see photo). The bed was my only sore point. It was a bit soft to my liking. But the next room I had contained a much better bed. Bathrooms are compact, but stylish and clean. One large chain hotel I stayed in had a huge bathroom and they never bothered to clean under the wash basins! yuch! Nice amenity kits too. Shower (which can hold two) was powerful. Rooms have A/c but the window can open as well so you can get fresh air. The second room I had was on the road side and slightly noiser in the early morning. There was a hum that I could hear at anytime which was the ventelation system I assume. 

Room service was fine and prompt with a very pleasant staff member delivering. He always made a point of saying hello when he saw me in the hotel over the next few days which makes a nice change from being invisible! The food was good, but I'd like to see a daily changing item for all us long stayers! And maybe a pasta dish too. 

Breakfast was efficient and tasty. 3 serials to choose from, a variety of juices, teas and coffee, mini danishes and croissants (just help yourself to as many as you want!) yoghurts, smoked salmon, mortadella, salami and cheeses as well as the full english. The eggs weren't to my liking but the sausages were not your boring standard ones. These were very tasty! Staff were very attentive here also. Check your rate to see if its worthwhile including breakfast or paying separately for it. My Sunday night stay was £90 incl breakfast, but room only was £70 and to buy the full buffet would have been £12.50 (the continental was 8.50, iirc)

There is a small ""fitness room"" which has a basic multi gym, runner and bike along with a few other pieces. Not fantastic, but does the job. 

This hotel is ideally located for those working in/visiting the area bounded by the Castlemead tower in the north, Temple Quay in the south/west and Up to Victoria St in the east. To get to the touristy bits, its a pleasant 10 to 15 min walk. Resturants were a bit lacking nearby, but maybe I didn't know my way round. A bus outside the door can take you to some of the busier areas. 

This is a lovely hotel and if I had to go back for work I'd stay there again. If I came on holiday I would look at the rate offered and what I wanted to see. I may stay elsewhere as a tourist just to be closer to the action, but I'd miss out on all the home comforts offered here and the quality of service from the staff.","6","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/17/aa/ad/bedroom.jpg","2006-10-31","2006-10-10","2006-10-09","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r5936265-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The romantic package as detailed on the website, whilst expensive, seemed like it would be a nice treat.  There is very limited parking, but luckily, we found a space.  When we got to our room, rose petals had been sprinkled on the bed and the box of chocolates were waiting.  Given that I had spent £195, I expected a larger box, not a box with 9 chocolates in, but all the same a nice touch.  The champagne (which I wouldn't recommend) was on ice, although the ice had melted and had formed an attractive puddle on the desk.  One of the champagne glasses was chipped and there was a card in our room addressed to a Mr Windsor (not me).  Aside from this, the room was small but perfectly adequate and clean and modern.  There was a LCD TV which was small, but good enough, dvd player, cd player and basket of goodies which you should check are all there first otherwise you will get charged.  The bathroom is absolutely tiny, and although the shower is powerful, and yes has room for 2, there is no bath and as I hadn't realised this, a big let down.  Bathrobes are supplied but they are not the nice fluffy, luxurious hotel robes, they are quite scratchy, and at one size only, are very small.  To make matters worse, once my husband had squeezed into his (as I said, they are small) he found a dirty tissue in the pocket - not nice.

DVD's and CD's are available to borrow free from reception and so we borrowed a DVD and curled up on the extremely comfy bed to watch.  As part of the romantic package a 3 course meal was included in the restaurant.  As commented by one previous reviewer, you were made to feel very much as though you could only have from the specific menu, and not upgrade, even if you wanted to - and this certainly wasn't good enough when it came to desert.  The food was very nice, although nothing particularly special and the service wasn't especially good.  one of the other things that was included in the package was a special champagne breakfast in bed.  When we had checked in, nobody asked us what time we wanted breakfast, or what we wanted so on the way upstairs I asked at reception.  They took the time that we wanted breakfast down, but didn't know what was included.

We had a very good nights sleep, but were rudely awaken at 8.30 with our breakfast - we had asked for it at 9.30.  Breakfast consisted of a very small english breakfast, a few small croissant items and some cornflakes. (oh and 2 glasses of the same horrid champagne) - all in all not impressive.  As it turned out, we could have specified what we wanted on the menu in room, and simply hung this on the door which would have given us a much better choice, however we were not told this and consequently left the hotel very hungry.

Had I simply paid the £75 room only price, I would have been perfectly happy with everything, but given the price would have paid for a top notch room at hotel du vin just down the road (albeit not including food) I was rather disappointed.  Would stay here for a quick stop over, but shan't be making a ""romantic"" night of it again.

We were on the first floor and there was a lot of noise from outside late at night from guests departing the bar downstairs.

Biggest gripe is that they held our deposit on our credit card for more than a week after we checked out due to staff not releasing the deposit upon our check out.  I had to follow up with more than 5 phone calls before the charge was released.

We love the contemporary feel of this “3 star” / “4 star” hotel, the staff and the excellent breakfast. 

Would we visit again? Absolutely – when the doors are fixed / hushed, the building work next door ends & the City Bar has a well ventilated no smoking section. 

We would not pay rack prices for this hotel and we would find it difficult to entertain for business in the City Bar. There is more info in the Bristol TA Forum. 

This hotel rates itself as ""4 star"" and the accommodation standards they used are not yet available to us. However, the AA has awarded 3 stars [74%]. Enjoy England (The official site for English tourism): 3 stars. If we had booked only one night we would not have returned: the first night [26th August] was the worst and totally unacceptable. However, the next two nights were good and then excellent! 

We select four key issues 1] Noise, 2] Smoking and environmental policy, 3] Channel 20: UK “Playboy”, 4] Security / safety. These four issues are “our” fatal flaws in the hotel’s quality standard in relation with a “4 star rating”. 

There are many truths about this hotel's star rating! If we judge it by a 3 star standard it is excellent bar the fatal flaws. If we judge it to 4 star standards it is found wanting in some respects and excels in others. Excellent overall at the hotel was the breakfast in all respects. We encountered none of the comments made previously about breakfast except the issue of the cornflakes. We both found the twin beds very good. However, the “twin” beds are placed next to each other with no gap between. On one side there is a space of only about 20cm and this may not be what you expect from a “twin” room. Housekeeping in the bedroom was very good overall.  The absence of some room features means that, for us, this is not a 4 star style room. We did not eat any of the ""City Temptations"". Oddly it seems that the customer is expected to inform the hotel if any one of the 8 items is missing on arrival immediately or they will be charged for it. We read that 3 days later! Before we rant about specific noise issues it must be pointed out that the hotel is in a quieter location in town than some others more close to the centre. Harbourside and up to Broadmead can get noisy and rowdy on Friday and Saturday evenings. Noise: Stay away from the central and southern rooms. There is a well publicised claim: “high-level sound proofing”. This appears to be about the bedrooms and bedroom facilities. It does not say “soundproof” or “soundproofed”: the verb “soundproofing” is used and therefore it is ambiguous – maybe “towards” it? The sources of noise were multiple, complex and cumulative: mostly they are sporadic, impact noise.1] noise made by the opening closing of the bedroom doors by guests – they close with a load click, clack, slam. If you are unlucky, like us, to be placed near a group or party who shuttle between their allocated rooms you may get no sleep until the doors in the long corridor cease opening and closing. 2] The second source of noise was guest urination and movement of furniture from room 306 above. We did not hear any noise from the entertainment systems. 3] Another source of noise was the collection of rubbish and the delivery of supplies. This can also be combined with taxis waiting, collecting and departing. 4] We also established that the security guard patrols the hotel corridor regularly at night using the emergency fire escape to access the corridor. This activity explains the loud clumping noise I heard periodically – staff need to open and close doors quietly! 5] The door that opens and closes from the lift lobby to the corridor is also very loud and not hushed adequately. Avoid rooms at the centre of the hotel near this door that is in regular use - I can hear it late at night when the corridor is quiet from my “sound proofing” room 206. 6] We were not warned at anytime about the building works on a site adjacent to the hotel and a few metres from our room. The contractors start work early and the hotel needs them to pay and clean the windows! Avoid rooms 106, 206, 306 in particular and anything in the centre or south of the hotel until all these matters are improved or resolved. The Bathroom: Excellent. The City Bar: From conversations with hotel management it appears that this is a smoking bar and that there is no non-smoking provision in the City Bar beyond moving an ashtray off a table! On the first evening of our visit the ventilation in the city bar appeared to fail with the air getting hazy with smoke. We had to leave at midnight and we understand the engineer was called. However, the bar was full with smoking customers and if you are a smoker allocated one of the non smoking rooms you will find this to be the only other practical place to sit, relax and smoke. If you are a non smoker you might check to see if the ventilation is working before drinking here. Channel 20: Free porn channel, UK “Playboy”, if you, or your child, flicks though to channel 20 porn will be displayed at some times. We cannot confirm if this is available before 9pm or not. There is no warning visually or mechanically on the TV. TV info is buried towards the back of the room information manual and unlikely to be read. Safety / Security: The issue with noise from the fire escapes lead us to notice that there are no security cameras on accommodation floors - that we could see. However, this lack of intrusion might find favour with some hotel users and be a possible advantage for them. The cornflakes: The controversy about the cornflakes! The menu states “Kellogg’s cereals”. It does not directly say that the cornflakes are “Kellogg’s”. However, you can decide for yourself if the customer should be forgiven for thinking that his/her breakfast cornflakes should be from Kellogg’s! However, Miki does not like Kellogg’s and preferred whatever these were! Hence we rated this an excellent breakfast!  If you have a “compliant” we suggest you ignore the “feedback” form which seems to be overly prestructured and marketing inspired and simply contact/write to the hotel manager. There is no proper space on the feedback form to write a complaint anyway. Representing the hotel as ""four star"" needs some explanation or explicit criteria of the standards used whether they are in house or otherwise. Warning: beware the £3 tray charge for deliveries to your room! Jerry & Miki

It features well presented, bright if somewhat small rooms with very clean and contempory shower rooms (there are no baths).

LCD Television, DVD player, stereo and SKY channels in each room is more than the norm. And a free library of DVD's and CD's available from the lobby is a neat idea too. 

Service is pleasant and efficient, checkout is hassle free and prices, while a little over what you might pay at other short-stay business orientated hotels, are not unreasonable.

Only minor faults I would say were apparant:

The lobby was perhaps not as polished and as clean as the rooms themselves, which was a little strange. 

The breakfast provided an extensive range of food and drink but certain elements of it weren't great (the scrambled eggs and the coffee were fairly unpleasant to the taste)

Other than these small problems, the hotel provided a good if not grat experienceon the whole.

Recommended for short stay/business guests.

Comfortable and large bed with clean sheets.Got a good night's sleep both nights, but cleaning staff were a bit noisy first thing - chatting loudly at 07.30 am. Had a problem with DVD player which was fixed immediately. Reception staff were quick and effective- dealt quickly with a queue. We didn't use the dining room, but it looked clean and well set out.Overall a good hotel which we would use again.

Have stayed at many budget hotels over the years, among which I have found the Holiday Inn Express chain to be about the best. The City Inn reminded me very much of a HIE, but with the added benefits of Flat Screen TV, DVD and CD Players, Bathrobes (not fluffy!),  toiletries and ""dry min-bar"". On the downside, beakfast is not included at City Inn, but is at HIE. The price at City Inn was comparable at £115 for Friday and Saturday nights.

Our daughter's folding bed was not ready when we arrived, but we told reception when we were going out for the evening and it had appeared when we returned later.

Good value and quite satisfactory overall, but not impressed by letter when we arrived home, incorrectly stating that a bottle of water had been taken by us from the dry mini-bar and that £1.65 would be added to our bill. On complaining, was told this would be rectified - remains to be seen!

Service: 5","Excellent stay","We needed to stay a few nights in Bristol and searched through hotels. As we'd be communting to Cardiff on the Saturday we needed somewhere fairly central to stay - i.e. near the train station. This criteria was matched as the station was about 5 minutes walk away. Basically, come out of the main entrance to the station walk to the end of that road, turn right, cross the road and the hotels in front of you.

It was very tidy and clean inside as you'd expect, and was also full of all mod cons such as Sky TV (all the BBC ones, ITV/itv2, a few kids stations, CNN, Sky Sports (1-3 and Extra), BBC News 24, Sky News and Playboy) catering for all tastes as well as Internet points, DVD/CD player, radio etc. Not bad at all.

Now, the meals.

What can I say. The evening meal was a total and utter waste of money unless you like rubbish which costs £20 a time. I would not reccommend you eat an evening meal here unless you like minimalist food for top dollar.

Having said that, breakfast was excellent if a little pricey.

I had to chuckle when I read another review on this pay about the Corn Flakes not being Kellogs (as stated on the menu) and being soggy ... but it was accurate.

However, everything else was spot on. You help your self to the wide selection of cooked, continental or fruity breakfast. Top marks for this. 

Staff were helpful and friendly as you'd expect.

The rooms were very clean and comfortable, you get a kettle, snack basket (prices Comparable with other hotels), DVD player, CD player and small flat-screen TV, all as standard, I wish more hotels would have this as standard.  CD's and DVD can be borrowed free of charge from reception. 
There were only a couple of very minor drawbacks, but there will be with any hotel.  The bathroom was on the small side, but very clean, servicable and perfectly decorated.  There is very limited cupboard space and no drawers, but again, when on a short business stay, you don't nessecarily need these.
City centre approx 5-10 minutes walking distance, train station 10-15 min walk and buses are close by.

I didn't check tripadvisor on this trip as it was last minute and had no time however on checking when writing review, I found the other reviews unfounded and would recommend staying at this hotel so much so I will be staying again in June.

The hotel staff were amicable and helpful; the breakfast was very ample and delicious; the rooms were perfectly comfortable; you can walk into the centre of the city within 5-10 minutes adn buses are very close.

There were a few small drawbacks, but there will be with any hotel to be honest.  There was no bath in the bathroom (we had not realised this prior to booking) and the bathroom was on the small side, but clean, servicable and perfectly decorated.  The rooms were on the small side, but for a weekend city break, it was ideal.  There is very limited cupboard space and no drawers, but again, when on a city break, you don't nessecarily need these.

All in all, I found the previous reviews unfounded and would recommend staying at this hotel to anyone on a short break to this lovely city!

You get a kettle, DVD player and small flat-screen TV, plus a CD player as standard. CD's and DVD can be borrowed free of charge from reception. The reception staff are helpful but not as clued up on the local attractions and bus routes etc. as you might think.

Temple Mead station is a short walk but you must exit the station by a hidden back route. A Ferry to the city centre also stops nearby.

The Hotel has several drawbacks. Firstly, the rate is pretty good, but often does NOT include breakfast. The breakfast is very expensive at £12.50 for a hot buffet and £8 for continental.  Secondly, it is a good 10-15 mins walk from the centre of town. Hoiwever it is in a quite location. Parking is limited.  

I did not try the CirtyInn (its Restaurant) but it looked expensive. There is a nice Indian Restaurant opposite Temple mead Station.

The City Inn was very good but next time I will consider a Hotel nearer the City Center with breakfast included.

- The breakfast was not as good as I was expecting from a hotel of 4 star standard. The corn flakes offered were 'spongy' and definately not Kellog's cereal as claimed on the breakfast menu at the hotel.

But overall, a very good stay and will stay there again when in Bristol.

For a rather high price, I first got a stinking smoking room, than a room with no working water tap and finally a room which was newly renovated (the tape rests used for painting were still sticking on the walls). Soon I noticed that although I turned the air conditionning off, it was still fully functional. I was not able to change room due to limited availability for ""my offer"" (160 Euros!!).

Otherwise, I shared some of the recent opinions already posted on tripadvisor about the service: Breakfast although unexpected diverse for the UK was ok, but service was unavailable. ""No, we do not serve expresso"" (while the machine was clearly visible and worling...).  I had to ask three times for a taxi to be called, and had an unjustified charge on my next credit card bill (I used express checkout).

For our weekend stay, involving day trips out of Bristol, the location was excellent (close to Temple Meads railway station, but within walking distance of the city centre shopping and nightlife).

Rooms are bright, modern and attractive, compact but not cramped for two people, and well-equipped - LCD TV, DVD and CD players (free rental of discs from reception). There is complimentary broadband internet access (wired in the bedrooms and wireless in the ground floor public areas). Other reviewers have commented on the lack of wardrobe space - yes, smaller than average, but fine for a short stay. The rooms appear to be all of an identical standard and size. The bathroom is a reasonably-sized showerroom, with a powerful shower and mist-free mirror.

The advertised soundproofing of the rooms seemed to work well, with almost nothing noticeable from adjoining rooms, and just the occasional slamming door from the corridor. However we were on the quieter side of the building (west, overlooking Temple Church) rather than the other side which has the busy dual carriageway of Temple Way. The window blocked out most outside noise but I would expect some traffic noise to get through.

Though generally the room was clean and well-maintained, the housekeeping was haphazard - when we checked in, the previous guest's rubbish hadn't been removed, or the ""mini bar"" of snacks restocked (and they later attempted to charge us for the missing bag of Kettle Chips!). We had a pair of towels removed after the first morning and had to get replacements delivered. Other niggles were that not all of the advertised tv channels were tuned in and descrambled, and there was no teletext on the tv.

Breakfast was included in our rate, and was a good range of continental and cooked items. Only downside was having to pass through the smokers' enclave (the bar) to get in or out of the restaurant. We didn't have any other meals in the restaurant or try the fitness room.

Overall, good value for money and I'd certainly stay in a City Inn again.

Room was ok, but service was terrible. we had booked the Spring deal of DBB. When we sat for dinner the restaurant manager was very nice until he realised we had booked this package. He promptly told us which menu we could have and that we were not allowed to order from the ala carte menu. When i tried to order a nice bottle of red he told me it was not possible to use our offer of a free bottle that had been given to us against it. I said I knew this and still wanted the nice bottle i requested, but he still stood there telling me that I would not even get a discount off it! I didn't ask for one I just wanted the wine. I was left feeling ashamed to be there. The food was average and the service was poor from the waiters. We asked for breakfast in our room, which came with coffee instead of the ordered tea and only 1 set of cutlery. when my partner phoned down to rectify this the man sighed and put the phone down without saying anything. 

On checking out I was still polite amazingly and just wanted to leave but on checking the bill we had ironically been charged an extra £16.50 for something off the ala carte menu, and when I pointed this out the receptionist looked very stern (sighed) checked receipts and eventually printed of a new bill with no apologies. Needless to say we felt the need to go back to cornwall to relax again. Oh and the waiter was called Manuel, fitting.

Our 3 night stay was at a very good rate (average £75 plus breakfast) in a double room. The room was adequately sized although seriously lacking in storage  space (and if you bring your clothes on their own hangers there is nowhere to hang them and you will have to tranbfer them to the hotel's hangers for the specially appointed hanging areas).

Adequate in size with a 6ft bed,  but smaller than Americans might expect, the room has TV, DVD, CD/Radio and all the usual other stuff.

Interestingly, for a ""4 Star Deluxe"" the sheets were not big enough to tuck into the bed and pulled free during the night - I would expect a hotel with these claims to have big enough sheets!

Reception staff were very helpful and friendly, especially as they seemed to be doubling for the non-existent concierge (there was a desk but I never saw anyone there).

City Cafe is very good - well above average hotel dinner.

This is hotel is modern, cold, spartan and that suits many - don't expect chintz and old-fashioned style. I would rate it as an upmarket business hotel or for short stays rather than a suitable base for longer holidays.

We had a quick bite in the bar in the afternoon and were impressed with the food so booked table at the restaurant for dinner that evening. Requested table for 8pm but told could only book 8.30 so went for that. Arrived at 8.30 and the room was only about a 1/5th full. Before ordering were told that they were sold out of the pork and beef which took out a good deal of choice from the menu. Ordered their signature dish of scallops as a starter and told they had just sold out of that also, 2 minutes prior. Not sure how this is possible with a room only a 5th full. Food we did order was very nice though. Shower was good, with nice toiletries by The White Company. Word of warning - don't overpack! The wardrobes are little more than decoration with a depth about the size of the average shelf. Ordered 2 papers for the Sunday morning, only 1 arrived with half of it missing. Buffet breakfast was better than average. Think the hotel is best suited for the business traveller but for no more than a few nights.

Good points: Quiet location.  Good in-room entertainment, particularly sports.  Room was clean, well-maintained.  Room was above average size.  CD player/LCD TV/DVD player in room might be useful for longer stay customers - I suspect they're more 'impressive' than 'useful' for most customers.

Downsides:  Not particularly quiet within the hotel itself; lots of mechanical sounding bumping and clanging.  Given a smoking room when specifically requested non-smoking; they were able to change it but what is the point requesting it if they ignore it and if I'd ended up checking in an hour later I'd have been stuck in an ashtray for the night.  That's so important to me - the hotel loses a grade.  Not cheap, in fact unreasonably expensive, at £120/night.

We found the city in Bristol, having read the reviews we thought it might be a safe bet.  When we arrived there we found the hotel is located just east of the city centre.  We arrived at the hotel at around 10:30pm and found jsut a few parking spots left in the hotel parking lot.  We parked just next to the building, although these spots are not marked for parking, the hotel is very accomodating.  The 2nd night when their lot was full the reception staff very kindly pointed us to free lot across the street, but there is also parking on the side street just around the cornor if that is full.  

Aside from parking we found the hotel to be extremly clean, the bathroom reasonably big for UK standards.  The shower pressure was excellent, although we did find that the shower temperature changed from hot to warm if someone else used the sink, a minor inconveiniance, but unnoticable.   Rooms are average size and big for UK standards (compared to London). The beds are large and very comfortable.  

They have LCDs with DVD players in the room which is a nice touch, although the LCDs are extermely small and some may struggle to see it clearly from across the room.   They do have a good selection of DVDs at reception that are FREE to rent for guests - a very nice touch.  

We did read in the reviews that the resteruant/bar was a bit pricey so we avoided dining at the hotel altogether.  However, there is a street just about 10 minutes walking distance along the river which has several nice resteruants and lots of bars to get a drink.     

Overall we were exteremly pleased with our stay and would highly reccomend it!","1","","2006-01-31","2006-01-29","2006-01-28","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r4395332-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

I was particularly surprised at the range of channels on the TV (Sky One, Sky Sports etc), having expected just the standard free ones (BBC 3, E4 etc.). 
The bathroom was very clean and adequetly sized (for future reference, you can fit 2 people in the shower!!). The only disappointment was the lack of a bath. The breakfast was both extensive and delicious, albeit quite expensive (£24 for a fry-up and continental beakfast delivered to the room).

My only real complaint is that it's very easy to spend a lot of money here. A pint of Carlsberg Export and glass of Rioja cost me £9.75! Likewise, a 330ml bottle of water in the room will cost you over £1! The restaurant too is quite expensive so we ate elsewhere.

In summary, this is a lovely hotel - just be cautious when asked ""Can I charge this to your room?""

We had 2 rooms, both were excellent, clean, modern and tasteful. The staff was very friendly and very helpful.  We needed some maps, they copied theirs for us and brought them up to our room. The lounge/pub is comfortable and lively, the restaurant is good, but very expensive for Americans ($40 for an entree) with our weak dollar. The rooms are modern with a very nice flatscreen TV, a decent amount of cable channels, free DVDs available at the front desk, a CD player/stereo, nice robes, some free snacks, good sized bathrooms (for europe), and many other nice surprises. The free breakfast buffet was well above expectations, with a very hearty selection of eggs, beans, vegetarian sausages, real bacon and sausage, mushrooms, potatoes, fruit, breads, cheese, cereals, rolls, etc.  The food was of good quality and there were plenty of choices. The location was excellent for getting out of town quickly to roadtrip to Bath, Stonehenge, Cheddar, Wells, etc, and is near a lovely park and downtown esplanade.  The Bristol nightlife was absolutely wild, as the college kids were partying loud , drunk, and late on the weekend nights, it was dead by 10 pm on weeknights.
All in all, we would definitely stay here again.","5","","2005-11-30","2006-01-09","2006-01-08","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r4332819-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Excellent location for the station & if arriving by car you can use the car-park for as long as you want ( even after check out) which is very useful. As for the review - starting with the car park - just prey there is an easy space to slip into - the hotel do not enforse their own parking rules meaning parking can be an issue. Check in is always as it should be - wake up call / newspapers/ book for dinner / check your home address to faciliate express check out - so top marks. The hotel is about three - four  years old and the decor is still fresh as are the well appointed rooms - flat screen TV / DVD & CD players / comfy chair / fluffy gowan / small very bright shower room - OK for a night or two - if i was being picky I would say the rooms do need a little TLC ( new light shades etc but on the whole excellent. The cafe food of an evening is well presented but really over priced - £4.50 for very nice tomato soup / £10.50 for fish & eight ( yes 8) chips - so not good value - but nice surroundings. Breakfast OK but more presentation than content. Certainly a nice place to stay if someone else is footing the bill & you are not too hungry. Will be back but will dine out next time.

We were taken aback by the comfort of the Hotel. Very luxurious throughout complete with a very atmospheric bar.

The Hotel staff were very helpful and allowed us to check in early at no extra charge - very welcome after an early start! Great room facilities and very handy location for Temple Meads Railway station.

My only problem now is that my other half wont allow me to take her ANYWHERE else next time we are in Bristol.

We were able to get a special rate through the website and I'm glad to say it was all very worth it.  We didn't eat at the hotel or order room service, mostly to do with the fact we were seeing freinds all weekend.  The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean.

Good points :

- Rooms are clean and modern
- (Smallish) widscreen TV and DVD player in each room
- Free broadband internet from each room (and wireless in public areas)
- Comfortable double bed

But :

- Rooms are very small. The bed may be a double, but there isn't really space for two people to move around without colliding all the time. The bathroom is absolutely tiny, too, and has only got a shower - no bath.
- Free porn channel on the TV. Some might regard it as a plus, but I didn't appreciate finding this with no warning while channel hopping. Reception also told me that there was no way of blocking access to the channel from the room.
- No way to set a wakeup call, through the TV or the phone. 

There were other minor annoyances in the room, like built in coat hangers which fell out at the slightest provocation. The rooms looked nice, but they just weren't very well though out from a practical point of view.

Coupled to this, I had some problem or other each time I stayed - being allocated a smoking room when I had asked for a non-smoking, and so on.

The end result was that I just got irritated with the place. With more space in the room, and some more thought for the practicalities, it could be a really good hotel. As it is, it's OK for a night or two as somewhere to put your head, but don't expect too much.","2","","2005-04-30","2005-06-06","2005-06-05","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r3533918-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

Had to be moved twice until I got a half decent room. The so called gym is tiny. Another guest was given the key to my room. At breakfast I had to wait 30 minutes before my food arrived as they got my order mixed up. Room wasnt especially clean. Staff however are very polite and the food in the restaurant is quite good.

The staff were fabulous - professional and very pleasant. The reception staff even helped us find a rental car for a last minute trip to the Cotswolds and personally delivered more soap when we ran out. Our room was very pleasant and comfortable with all the amenities we could ask for. The breakfast buffet, included in the price of the room, was quite good. After ""roughing it"" in a couple tiny (crummy) hotels in London, this hotel was a fantastic treat for the price. A great value!

Hardly room for a bed and a small chair.  Makes opening your luggage very difficult. Bath room is also tiny with a shower so small an average size man has difficulty getting into it.  Forget the food, try the San Carlos instead.

At £80 a night it isn't the cheapest in Bristol, but the rooms are clean, the breakfasts are good - the usual smorgasboard of cereals, fruit, hot dishes, toast etc. I don't know whether I would recommend the evening meal as it is somewhat overpriced and the service is a bit slack. Still, the staff on the desk are helpful and pleasant. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the City Centre or Broadmead, but quite a long way from the Clifton Tourist District (catch the bus from Victoria Street and not outside the Hotel). Don't bother drinking here, as there are two nice historic pubs close by, the Shakespeare and Seven Stars which are a lot cheaper. OK for a 2-3 night stay !","3","","","2004-01-19","2004-01-18","en","Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre","211101","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d211101-r1556991-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre-Bristol_England.html"

The decor is funky and modern as well as being clean and comfortable. The restaurant is one of the best you'll find in Bristol, but the location isn't great.

We appreciated the calm of the view of the park but less noise coming from the other rooms and the corridor.
The TV is ok but only has one French channel
The bathroom is good with a large shower.
