Ate in restaurant which was fine, portions quite small but service friendly and efficient. 
Had a family room and despite setting the air con we were all awake at midnight as the room was like a sauna, checking the air con unit it had a fault code flashing. 
Having to traipse to reception at midnight and their only solution was 2 small fans that gave off the same level of noise as a pneumatic drill was pretty poor. It seemed they were fully aware of the fault. They then decided to try and haggle / argue about what discount they could give. I just wanted some sleep so left the staff member and manager to argue it out. Still no refund offered weeks afterwards, we barely slept at all due to the temperature of the room and then 2 ridiculously loud plug in fans as the only solution.","0","","2024-04-30","2024-04-28","2024-04-28","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r948687257-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The rest of the staff were friendly and very helpful and the hotel clean - it’s what you would expect. I even like the fact there is conditioner in the shower! This review is about the parking fee which is eye-watering and as I wasn’t expecting it has left a very sour taste in the mouth. £45!!! And that was to park for less than 12 hours!! The parking is owned by Bristol airport not the hotel but if I was any part of the hotel/Hilton I would hope that these poor reviews would propel them to try harder with the airport  to lower those charges for customers of the hotel.

Sleep Quality: 3","BE VERY CAREFUL WITH PARKING CHARGES IN AND AROUND THIS HOTEL!!!","This review is not to slate the actual hotel as the hotel it's self is OK and we had no issues with the hotel itself, rooms were comfortable, and breakfast was OK. 
However what they do not tell you before arriving is that parking overnight is usually charged at £60 a night which is ludicrous, this is reduced to £45 if staying at the hotel.
You only have 1 hr parking free upon arrival to check in and then u must use  nearby car parks, the pricing for these are very steep.
My main issue is that upon arriving home after a wonderful holiday to Egypt, I received a £100 fine for stopping outside the entrance to the hotel that evening after a meal in Bristol, for literally 1 minute to drop off my partner and boys before transferring my car to the silver zone car park.  Apparently it's a no stopping prohibited zone and there are lots of signs saying this, how exactly they expect you to be able to read these signs though when you are driving and it's dark I have no clue. 
I appealed it as felt it was unjust considering it was literally a drop off, and was literally less than a minute, but it's been rejected. 
So please please be careful whilst using this hotel. The land is privately owned and the car parks and the b******s will fine u for anything they can!!! I will definitely not be taking my car anywhere near this hotel car park again. I am not the only one who has been fined, my best friend also had a fine the day after myself, for literally leaving the hotel car park within her 1 hr slot.  And stopping to give way to a car coming from the right. How they can get away with this is just ludicrous, when she literally by law has to stop at a junction to give way to the right. Did they expect her to pull out straight into another vehicle approaching. Have seen other reviews on here also about it.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/c6/08/fe/caption.jpg","2024-03-31","2024-04-02","2024-04-02","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r944969914-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Previously informed via phone discussion with the Hampton by Hilton and also in their confirmation email that we could use the car park for drop off for up to an hour. We were surprised to see a sign about £60 charge and fines at the entrance to the car park so paused (for less than a minute!) to read this. Slapped with a £100 fine in the post for ""stopping"". It was dark, it was cold, we had a baby in the back seat who was just waking up and quite upset, we briefly paused to read the sign. I have tried to appeal this, sent the parking company a confirmation email and told that my appeal is unsuccessful. 

Needless to say I will not be staying again, I will also inform all my family and friends to make sure they never stay here either.

I have emailed Hampton by Hilton and await a reply.","1","","2024-01-31","2024-02-28","2024-02-28","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r940101441-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Room is clean and functional with good toiletries. However it’s simply not worth the money charged; the lack of competition sets this. The evening meal really let this occasion down; the food quality has been deteriorating and this time it was borderline inedible, washed down with £10 a glass wine.

The pillows were a little too soft, but that's a preference not a complaint. Despite being next to an airport there was zero noise, couldn't even hear traffic. Plus, being at the end of the corridor prevented the usual ""hotel noise"" of opening/Closing doors etc. room temperature was easily adjustable.

We didn't eat that night but did have a coffee in the bar. Again, exceptional customer service. There is a handy section selling travel toiletries (all under 100ml).

Breakfast was great. Buffet style offering pastries, pancakes, waffles and full English. Can't fault it.

Will definitely be booking again next time we fly from Bristol.

Service: 2","Disappointing for such a Prestigious Name","Used the Hotel to save an early morning drive to Bristol Airport with an 09:30 Book In to the Multi Storey Car Park. Check In was straight forward as was parking the Car in their Car Park. Very disappointed with the Bar and Eating Area which was untidy and looked well worn, even to the extent of having cushions missing from the settees, tables were uncleared and had not been wiped down. The meal was mediocre to say the least, expensive and not up to what I would expect from a Hotel of this name. The rooms and sleep quality were very good. Where you have to be very careful is the Car Parking, on check out you are advised to process your car park ticket through a machine in the Lobby, I assumed that it would just be validated for exit however, I was asked to pay £60:00 for the 1 night parking. Reception then told me that if I push a little white button the charge would be reduced to only £45:00.as I had stayed at the Hotel. Nowhere in the Hotel details does it advise you of these charges, it just say Car Parking available. It would have been better/cheaper for me if I had booked my car into the Multi Storey the night before and then just walked across to the Hotel. These charges are almost bordering on extortionate. then to cap it all, having paid, we decided to have breakfast only to find that when we tried to leave the Car Park that the exit time limit had expired and it would not let us out. I had to re-park and get the Receptionist to arrange for our release. They could do a lot to improve this Hotel but I will not be using them again.","2","","2024-01-31","2024-01-26","2024-01-26","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r935592753-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

When we stayed the restaurant wasn’t particularly busy but there was a 45-60 minute wait for food and even then people were waiting longer. The person sat next to us was offered two meals that were for another table and after waiting over an hour they settled for a pizza, even though that wasn’t what they ordered, but was the quickest food to get out. The lack of catering management continued into breakfast, with long waits for food to be replaced on the hot plate, broken catering machines and a general feel of disorganisation.

Could they not have had the insight to either produce a leaflet / map or at least have a notice board indicating the route and how long it would take to get to departures - for some this might be critical. For others with a disabilty or very young children they were on their own, quite literally. Currently there is no provising for transport  to the airport other than walking.

I rang the Hilton and spoke to the very friendly manager there called Tom. Tom couldn't have been more helpful,  going beyond the call of duty. ...he secured a room for me, my wife, and 2 young children at a reasonable price with a nice breakfast included.

Location is ideal - right by the multi story car park and close to walk to the terminal. That’s pretty much where the positives end. 

Negatives:
- checked in and chose room via the app in advance but key card in app doesn’t work so have to check in at the front anyway (not much of a queue for us but noted it was much bigger later on!)
- Queue for food and/or drink was very big after 6pm. Food and drinks were ok, nothing to shout home about. Wanted a drink midway through my meal but would have meant a +20 minute queue while my food got cold! 
- Kids menu was terrible (chicken nuggets or hummus (not and, or) for £8!! 
- Snacks (those you’d normally have from a vending machine) are via the same long queue above (ie bring your own or go hungry!)
- Pull out bed in room was very uncomfortable and double bed in room was small. Considering this is a Hilton and we paid £200 for the night this was very disappointing. 
- We didn’t use the hotel car park but noted it’s £5 for 0-20 minutes!
Overall it’s convenient for flights, but unfortunately monopolises the market here.

Service: 5","Good staff, basic hotel for inflated price. Handy for early flight though.","Stayed for 1 night prior to 0600 flight from airport.  Hotel is clean and tidy but VERY overpriced for what it is.  I would say more like an upmarket Travel Lodge to be honest.  We were in our room less than 12 hours - didn't check in till 4pm and left 0300 to check in at the terminal. So, easy money for them as we hardly made use of room.
Room very clean - issues were with air con and inability to open a window - even a small amount = meant we woke up with thick stuffy heads due to not having any fresh air.
We ate in the bar - surprisingly the food was ok.  Not huge portions but very reasonably priced compared to price of the room.  I thought they would have inflated the bar/restaurant prices but not so.  
We did not have breakfast as we had to check in early - they did offer a takeaway bag but at 0300hrs neither of us felt like eating.
The trek to the terminal is longer than normal and I am limited mobility - what I found most difficult is that you are walking into the arrivals 'traffic' of people and they are all walking towards you when you are walking TO  the terminal and nobody moves out the way and there is no separation between arrival and departure walkways so it's a bit of a bun fight and if you are poor mobility it can be a bit daunting.  Not helped by steps, uneven surface and lots of trollies in the way - not at all helpful and would be a nightmare for someone with impaired vision.
The staff at this hotel were VERY good - jolly and helpful (especially one blondish girl on reception who was very chatty) - but at check in times there was a bit of a queue so more staff are needed.","1","","2023-10-31","2023-10-23","2023-10-23","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r922610893-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Breakfast is from 4am to 11am, we caught the end of the service but it was still really hot and fresh.

The only (slight) downside, which isn't the hotel's fault, is that due to building works the walk from the terminal is more of a trek than usual but it's still great to get through security and be in your room within half an hour!

No rooms were then available so the incredibly rude receptionist left us stranded for the night not offering any assistance until she was told that one of our party had health condition and even then was finger pointing to her colleagues rather than offering much assistance. Completely put a dampener on 30th birthday celebrations. As well as going on to cost us extra when we eventually did find a place to spend the night.

Greetings at reception were warm and the check in very efficient.  

Annoyingly  the next day no one could tell me where the Uber collection point was or where the taxi company was situated, no collection from outside the hotel, so a little annoying.  Most hotels have a map so they can easily point out these types of locations, or staff that can easily explain them. 

I did find the Uber collection point and when Uber decided they couldn't be bothered to collect me on a busy Sunday morning Arrow Cars situated just outside the terminal provided me with transport, it was a good service if a little on the expensive side.  Of course now I know more about the set up of the airport I would either catch the bus into Bristol or arrange transport with Arrow.  

The room was bog standard but seemed to have excellent sound proofing which was great!   The sink drain was blocked but other than that every thing such as towels and cleanliness was all good. 

Its a shame that Hampton hotel and Arrow Cars have a monopoly in the airport which adds to the high prices.  As the airport grows alternatives and a railway connection would be good. 

The breakfast was dreadful and the worst I had in the UK that week.  The food was so hyper processed and poor quality, although the Ubley yoghurt was good.  I felt for such a high price, such a terrible breakfast was annoying!  I will try in future to pay extra for better flight arrival/departure times so I can avoid having to stay near the airport at all, my bad, my lesson learnt.

Rooms are very basic. Modest size but fairly 'clinical'. Clean, but basic. Staff seemed friendly enough throughout. 

The worst part by a long mile though was the food and restaurant. It's like a school canteen. Menu is very childish: chips, burgers, pizzas and a couple of other bits. No table service either, you have to order and collect at the bar. When food was ready, you're also told cutlery is somewhere else. Loads of staff loitering doing nothing, yet it's all self service? Bizarre! 

I had the daily special curry which was a Madras: straight out of a jar! Stale popadom which bent rather than snapped, over cooked rice, accompanied by a tasteless, meatless curry. Naan bread was like play dough too, just awful. £17 for the curry, £7 for a pint of lager!

Whilst the room was ok (clean, adequately equipped) the catering was appalling. To order any food or drink you had to queue in an airport security arrangement of taped aisles. We ordered  two white wine spritzers and a packet of crisps for £22(!) to start and specified dry wine with soda. Neither the guy at the till nor the assistant behind the  bar had any idea what wines they sold or what type they were. We opted for one but when we got them to the table the ‘soda’ was lemonade. I took them back and explained that I had reiterated soda. She made me two more using two different sofa streams. One was indeed soda but the other was still lemonade. When I took them both back to the manager and asked for a refund, having lost heart and hope, she didn’t believe that one was lemonade as ‘it would have been more bubbly’. She declined to taste it.  This was as insulting as it was rude. I got a refund and went to the airport concourse and bought a super bottle of M&S wine for £10. Sadly there were no restaurants open in the evening before Departures so the hotel has a monopoly on food. Their menu is very limited, unimaginative and heavy. No salads. Not even fish and chips which would have been a safe bet. In fact, the watery chicken korma was ok though there were no side like mango chutney or raita (obvs). It was very beige. 
In addition the ambience, lighting and seating are like a hospital waiting room - and two banquettes had no seats, just holes to the floor. It was a depressing and frustrating experience and an awful start to our holiday. And it’s £172 for the cheapest room!  A total rip off. We didn’t risk the breakfast next morning. We will avoid this at all costs in future and fly from another airport if possible.","0","","2023-09-30","2023-09-15","2023-09-15","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r916733331-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

 The room was spotless and the beds were really comfortable, we had a good night's sleep. For breakfast you could have waffles, toast, cereals, fruit and a choice of a hot food to name a few.

No nice welcome (good evening, how was your travel..anything really) 
Considering you welcome weary guests from all around the world, this is lacking any form of kindness and plain customer service.
The entrance to your hotel is not evident with the current works happening at 11pm at night. I fed this back on arrival and the response was ""there are signs"" and ""it's not us doing the works""
I had prewarned the hotel works of our arrival time and noted I was travelling with my dad (in his late 60's and frail and my toddler). No mention of this, with the darkness and the line of bus goers, we missed it.
I appreciate it's not your works, however the response was plain awful. A sneer from the lady in the f&b uniform and a laugh from Hannah as we were walking away. Talk about school bullies. 
Maybe some more training in customer service would be welcomed. 

It’s not cheap to stay and be insulted/mocked within 2 minutes of arrival, but you’re guaranteed it at the Hilton Bristol Airport.

I see from past reviews that a lack of accountability is served and most guests who review negatively get a cut and paste response.

When we got to the hotel to check we were told they only had accessible rooms available as rooms are allocated on a first-come basis. What is the point of asking what room you would like during the booking process then if it's ignored? I feel they took advantage that we were arriving so late.

The room was basic. The shower floor was slippy so I had to put a towel on the floor. The bathroom looked grubby and there was a slight smell of poo from the drain in the shower!

We were tired and there was no point complaining as the only rooms they had left were accessible ones anyway!

The room was not worth the £161 I paid, it was worth about half of that!

If I could find a way to complain on their site I will be asking for a refund or a least a part refund!

Next time I will pay a little extra and just get a taxi back to Devon if we get a late flight back. Never staying here again!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/0b/f9/ed/caption.jpg

The one disappointing thing was the breakfast.  It was a basic buffet with very limited choices. Only scrambled eggs available for the English breakfast and that had the appearance of being cooked in a plastic bag. Premier Inn breakfasts are far superior to this. I expected much better from the Hilton Brand. (£213)

Service: 5","Ignore the negative reviews!","Ignore the negative reviews about this brilliant hotel!  Firstly the Reception staff are amazing given that they know most of their clients will be at the hotel less than 12 hours.  They are polite and friendly.   I have probably stayed there 6 times in 2 years and have never heard any plumbing noises.  Book here for peace of mind knowing you are at the airport and a stone's throw from the check in desk.  Even if you do what I did this trip and sleep through the wake up call you can still make it in plenty of time!

Whether you book a room airport facing or airport car park facing you will find things quiet, but the car park facing rooms are perfectly quiet and my favourite.  Yes the price is a little expensive but you are already there!  Yes the food and drink is expensive and the menu is limited and unvarying but there is something for everyone.  I have always stayed on the top floor, floor 3 so that I dont hear people walking over head.  I haven't ready any review that this is a problem however.

I always use this hotel before a flight and sometimes after a flight depending on the circumstances. 

This time (ten days ago) I used the gym for the first time. It is  spotlessly clean, well equipped and has plenty of COVID cleaning measures still in place.  I pretty much had it to myself.  

The only negatives about this hotel are the coldness of the rooms in the winter months but you can ask Reception to over ride the room controls and heat the room for you.  You will also have to ask them to stop the heating over ride too when you are warm enough.  The breakfast is what lets the side down.  Every time I have stayed here the tables have been sticky, probably not wiped down from the night before.  The choice of food and the food itself is a bit lack lustre and doesnt match the quality you find in every other department.  You can perfectly well find food to eat but its a bit of a downer.  But given that you are at the airport and you eye is on the clock it doesnt matter that much. 

Book, you won't regret it.","0","","2023-06-30","2023-06-22","2023-06-22","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r896990336-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The room on the face of it was fine, we decided to get a drink at the bar and a couple of chocolate bars, oh dear!!! The prices were horrendous…..more so for the chocolate bars, make sure you bring your own!! 
We then went back to the room to watch tv and relax, the tv was cheap and nasty……the sound quality was so bad it vibrated the whole set. We had it at such a low volume in the end we couldn’t hear what was being said. 
The sink in the bathroom had somebodies tooth paste smeared around the back of it and the shower had hairs in it. 
We did complain and we were offered another room but we declined as it was too much hassle to re pack everything just for one night. 
I just felt that maybe an offer of a free drink at the bar instead would have gone a long way and made us feel a bit more important as customers.

Why would you not stay at the Hampton?
Sure you could save a few quid and drive up or stay near by and still drive up.
But honestly I can't see why you would bother.
The staff , many of them I remember from my last stay , are amazing. 
Seriously the welcome I got was worth the extra money alone.
That  all comes down from a strong management ethos.
It runs through the whole team.
Rooms are great , food a little limited, but perfectly acceptable.
Drinks overpriced, I wouldn't have expected anything else.
But the convenience, that's what you pay for.
A complimentary continental breakfast from 4 am is very welcome.

       We stayed at this very nice hotel the night before our flight.  Overnight parking at the hotel was £14.  The parking ticket needs to be validated at the reception, then at the payment machine next to the lifts the payment is made.  We checked in our flight hold luggage the evening before our flight, and it was a 5-to-10-minute walk to the airport terminal.  Most of the walk was in a covered walkway, up to the point where you cross the road.  Then you can either take the steps or use the sloping walkways to the terminal.

       We had a high floor room which faced the airport terminal drop off and pickup point, this made for interesting people watching.  Cold breakfast starts at 04:00 and hot food starts at 06:00.  The hotel looks to be very new, and our room was very clean, fresh, and new looking.  There is quiet air con and heating which seemed to work in a delayed manner, but it kept us at a comfortable temperature.   The room has the usual facilities; soaps, kettle, tea and coffee.  

       This is a very nice hotel to stay in, most notable points are its clean and fresh feel along with very helpful staff.

Breakfast was good although if your a vegetarian there aren't lots of options, I also found the orange juice very watery, perhaps there was an issue with the machine but what was on offer was nice and would definitely stay again.

Check in was smooth and we appreciated having our parking validated before taking our car rental back.

The lobby is modern and impressive, complete with comfortable seating areas, WiFi, a bar and restaurant.

Our room was very nice, spacious and clean, BUT there was NO hot water in the shower the morning we checked out! This was a great annoyance considering we paid 145.60 GBP!!

The restaurant provides a number of hot meals at affordable prices. I ordered the vegetarian curry and found it bland, the naan bread and poppadom clearly came out of a packet. My husband had the chicken parmigiana and was disappointed because it had been microwaved.

The hotel certainly had its pros and cons, however, I expected more considering it was a Hilton.","0","","2023-04-30","2023-04-26","2023-04-26","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r887820030-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Service: 3","Not cheap but not classy","The Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport is a fairly new hotel. It’s within easy walking distance of the terminal and breakfast is served from 4am (with hot food from 6am) for an early flight. We had a spacious room with a good shower and comfortable bed and the hard-working staff were welcoming. However, in an area very like a motorway service station, it has a very limited evening menu – sandwiches, baked potato, burger, pasta, pizza, curry – and the evening we were there, we had to queue for 20 minutes just to order. Meanwhile the automatic doors kept opening every time someone walked past, letting in the cold February air. And then things got worse. Our room was very cold and, although the air conditioning was set to 21.5 degrees, it just blew in cold air.  We could find no instructions for the controller and the bed had a very thin quilt with no extra blankets so we had to wear some of our day clothes to be warm enough to sleep.  To some extent we were unfortunate but we paid £158.65 for a booking that could not be changed or cancelled in a hotel which lacks class. This is 2 or 3 times as much as an equivalent hotel a little further away so it’s a lot extra to pay, just to be close to the airport.

I would have preferred no breakfast at all, but the hotel insisted because they did not want to refund the breakfast.
It was packed, and I was put in a wing full of teenager scouts going for a trip, and this because of my early checkout?

So quiet, a great place to rest before/after a flight. 

One downside was the bathroom. I appreciate that the room was fully wheelchair accessible, but the shower flooded both times it was used as the drain seems to be in the wrong place and water flows easily around the floor. Also, only accepting card payments at the bar is very inconvenient. I do not have a UK card, and wanted to avoid any additional bank charges for transactions abroad by paying in cash but this was not permitted. This should be thought about by management as I cannot be the only traveller who choses to pay in cash. Otherwise, a great stay and would recommend for a restful nights sleep.

Tip : If coming off a flight with extra luggage, eg ski or ski boot bags as well as  suit cases, it is worth paying £ 2 for a trolley at baggage arrival and you can then get to the hotel easier via gradual lowering pathways, across  from the  airport exit.  If you are going to a flight with extra bags, it may be worth going up to the airport  car park first where, like we did when going on holiday , and found a number of trolleys left by others - and didn't have to pay for one !","0","","2023-03-31","2023-03-09","2023-03-08","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r881518460-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Went to Reception to be greeted by the absolutely lovely Chelsey who greeted us with the most beautiful smile.  She was amazing, thanked me for me a Hilton Honours member, described everything in detail and told us to come straight back to her if anything was unsatisfactory.  Chelsey is an assess to the hotel. Room was clean, lovely towels,adequate space, safe,comfortable beds.  Food in the evening was fine, the usual quick meals, if you want anything other than that then this is not the place for you, after all this is an airport hotel. Breakfast was nice, quite a choice but be nice to have some tomato.  Cannot fault the night we spent there before our flight.

We stayed on our return on the 5th March.  We checked in at 12.30 pm and our greeting was so different.  No happy Chelsey, we were greeting with a chap (didn't get his name) who never even smiled and the only thing he asked was our name which I had to give him 3 times before it registered with him.  He handed us our room key and still did not speak. I asked what time breakfast was as we seemed to think it changed in the week.  He told us it was until 11.00 am.  I queried this with him 4 times but he still said 11.00 am.  We thought as we were late in we would sleep in a bit so we went to breakfast at 9.30 only to be told breakfast finished at 10.00.  At 9.50 am breakfast was being taken away. We were not happy as we like to enjoy our breakfast and not have to rush it down.

I would have given this hotel 5 stars but the chap on reception lost them the extra star, nevertheless I would still stay at this hotel.  I do hope though that this member of staff is spoken to.","0","","2023-03-31","2023-03-07","2023-03-07","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r881363079-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

£5 to drop guests off at the hotel, at pricing for room there should be no need to try and fleece them for simply getting out of a car.

That said reception staff were great and we validated ticket which appeared to get our parents out without charge.

Why not just allow a drop off in a their secure car park without the hassle.

Room was very clean but also very chilly. I do wish hotels would warm room prior to guest arriving, we've paid for it.

Bathroom was clean with lovely shower.

Be warned.... If on an early checkout you might not get the breakfast you paid for. We asked and we were told take out bags for breakfast would be available. Got down at 04:10 and told sorry no breakfast available to go.

A lovely clean corporate hotel with great staff but if you're on an early flight I'd recommend trying one of local guest houses within 800m. You'll pay less for room which means you'll have extra cash to pay for the breakfast you'll be forced to buy at the airport.","0","","2023-03-31","2023-03-04","2023-03-04","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r880960259-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The bar/lounge/dining area is grim with zero atmosphere.  The food is of poor quality and in some cases has been “changed” to what they have described on the menus they have placed on the tables.  Breakfast is basic and below average.  Premier Inns are generally of a higher standard.

Overbright reception staff, appalling impersonal room, the much-vaunted breakfast had excellent bacon, but dry hash browns, tasteless scrambled eggs and some black stuff they claimed was coffee but wasn't.

Worst of all, and adding insult to injury, was the fact that you had to,pay a rip-off extra £5  just to drive to the front door; at reception when leaving the next morning, I heard two reception staff laughing over the fact  that some poor person had got stung for an extra £40.  And they thought it was funny!

You will have a miserable time here and be overcharged for it.  Go somewhere else, i implore you!

So the rooms are functional, small but well presented and maintained. But the dining offering is no more than a feeding station. It would work for cattle and sheep but the fare is limited and fairly awful. This is NOT fine dining but equally it is not what truckers would accept in a transport cafe. My cheesburger with chips was some form of processed meat which had clearly been overcooked and burnt at the edges several times before, had no taste and was tepid at best. The cheese slice which had been added was soft but not melted. The the chips were good. The staff appears to have little culinary trainihg and warm offerings are microwaved on demand. Guests are a captive audience because, apart from the airport terminal, there is nowhere else to go.

Food offering is terrible. Dinner is a folded A4 menu, limited choice and nothing better than pre made, overpriced and poorly presented food. Stood in a constant queue of 8 and more to order just like a Wetherspoons, after food you need to I’ve on and order drink separately. Food was appalling quality at dinner and same experience at breakfast. Lukewarm food, poor quality food, dirty uncleared tables, bins were filthy and shocked at how bad the hygiene was

In summary, hotel is great, food is very poor verging on a joke, for a Hilton and the prices charged they should and must do better. Food service completely lets this hotel down","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/27/7e/fe/ea/so-called-main-course.jpg

Very nice hotel looks as though maybe recently refurbish (or kept to a very high standard)

Staff are friendly and the food was nice. 

Strange that when you check in you have to authorise your card at that point to later put food and drinks into your room (which we didn’t do). It just means that each time you order food or drinks you have to pay there and then which isn’t the end of the world but is a bit annoying all the same. A good night sleep, comfy bed, 5 mins walk to the airport… perfect.

Only thing to be aware of is that the parking is controlled by the airport not the hotel, you get a discounted rate the night you stay (£14 instead of £20 or something like this)  which I found a little off as other Hilton’s I’ve used offer a park and fly rate which this hotel would definitely benefit from being able to offer.","0","","2022-12-31","2022-12-17","2022-12-17","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r872046199-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Special shout out to Alex Wall. My husband has limited mobility and airport assistance can only be pre-booked within the terminal itself. Alex arranged for OCS to transfer me to the terminal from the hotel reception and also arranged for his reception staff to confirm the arrangements a couple of hours ahead. Everything went smoothly on the day with no stress.
Only negative was that the room was very cold when we arrived and took a couple of hours to warm up.","0","","2022-12-31","2022-12-13","2022-12-13","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r871618240-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

And the staff were excellent!
Our main gripe was the restaurant process, a queue to order and pay and then a different queue for the drinks . However what pushed our patience beyond the limit were groups of young kids running around the tables screaming and generally out of control. I must ask, why don’t the hotel put out a message asking parents to control them.

It is very expensive. We paid nearly £300 for one night with parking in Silver Zone for one week (for two adults sharing).
The hotel is right next to the airport; on the same site really. This makes it very convenient, especially if you have an early flight like we did.
There is a good choice of food for an evening meal and it’s not extortionate. Very tasty too (I had the falafel burger and fries; my husband had the curry). 
All of the staff are very friendly, chatty and help in any way they can. 
The rooms are spacious and have everything you need including shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, body lotion and so on. Also tea and coffee in the room, which is an essential for me as I can’t function without a cuppa when I wake up, especially when the alarm is set for 03:30!
The bed was comfortable. 
The entire hotel is immaculately clean. 
Breakfast is included in the price and starts at 4am. There was fresh tea and coffee, bread for hot toast, cereals, pastries, fresh fruit, yoghurt, muffins and fruit juice. If you didn’t have time to eat it all, there are paper bags to put it in to take to the airport, as well as paper cups with lids for your hot drink. 
If you need to check out before 4am, you can just pick up a bag with a simple breakfast to take to the airport. 
Cooked breakfast starts at 6am, but I can’t comment on that as we checked out at 04:20.
Despite the high price, we would definitely stay there again if we have an early flight from Bristol.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/26/cc/cd/56/hampton-by-hilton-bristol.jpg","2022-10-31","2022-11-07","2022-11-06","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r867534614-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

It’s worth it especially if you’re flying with jet2 to drop off luggage night before as part of their twilight service and then just walk (literally couple of minutes) to security next morning.

Easy to find , clear instructions and very close to the terminal.
Upon entering our room we noted it appeared dirty / food under the bed.  
We then left the room to find “ housekeeping “ running and chasing each other with what appeared to be the  linen trolley . This likely explained the poor state of our room.
We informed staff at reception whom were polite and apologetic and ensured us the room would be cleaned straight away .
Food in the restaurant was very nice and generous portions.
Upon returning to the room we noted the sofa bed to be hard and uncomfortable- we addressed this at the time and were told that all the rooms are the same . The only option we had was to possibly book and pay for another room . Having just paid £280 we felt this was totally unacceptable . 
The location of this hotel is great , but sadly I don’t. Think with the experience we have had we would stay here again .

So after a long and delayed flight I had to go back down to reception and ask if that is definitely our room as it’s dirty! The gentleman laughed and said I’m sorry that room was supposed to be cleaned and give us another room.

Also, bought two glasses of wine in the bar the night before and it came to just over £14! Might be because I’m a northerner and used to cheaper prices but it did seem a bit over the top!

I think it is overpriced for what it offers & when compared with other hotels in the group in similar locations.
Reading this I would put it at 3 out of 5 but give it a 4 because of its location.

We were able to order food and drinks when we arrived and the two twin rooms were great. Perfectly clean and just what we asked for. In fact these were the best beds that we had the pleasure to sleep in during the trip. Breakfast is perfectly adequate and included in the price.

We stayed as a family, myself, my husband and our 1 and 2 year old. 
We hadn't pre booked parking as the hotel appeared to state you can park there for £8 a night however, this is only if you are staying in the hotel and not for the duration of your holiday, even if upon return you intend to stay in the hotel. Luckily, the man on reception was very warm, welcoming and friendly and explained my error and what was my best option moving forward. 
As for the room itself, the cot bed requested was already prepared in the room and it was a good size with a nice lounger chair and a big bed. The amenities were so very basic and no mini fridge. It was pleasantly quiet and no disruptions to the little ones (some hotels just have no regard for noise control, but this one certainly did) we even had a wave from the window from the man changing the flags which was very nice. There aren't any luggage trolleys within close proximity, for this, you need to go to the airport itself and pay for a trolley and take it to your parked car at the hotels car parking. We then moved the car to the multi storey parking. The hotel and multi storey are in close proximity of each other and a short walk to departures. 

All in all, a nice hotel and basic room, but certainly not what one might expect from a 'Hilton' hotel, it compares more to a Travelodge.

The reception staff do not even look up to greet incoming clients, look a little scruffy in their appearance, take an inordinate amount of time to checkin, even when prebooked using the HH app, and read out the room numbers out loud when handing over the room card - which I reprimanded one lad for in the name of security risk (he questioned why it was a problem, which indicates they have received no training on customer security and wellbeing).  The rooms are functional, with a tea maker but no bottled water (supposedly offered to Honors clients, but not available apparently), and have a sliding door to either close the bathroom or close the wardrobe but not both! Going to breakfast, one walks past Reception - again where not one staff looks up or volunteers a cheery good morning - through a canteen style dining area to a corner breakfast room which is milling with ground crew staff piling high their plates as breakfast is obviously offered to them.  Overall, this hotel is convenient for late or early flights, but otherwise could not recommend.","2","","2022-07-31","2022-07-22","2022-07-22","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r849209565-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

At check in as Hilton Honors members  we asked for the complimentary water  to be told  they don't do this in Bristol.   Strange how they do in all other Hampton's we have stayed in.

 The seating areas in the lobby and the dining area are very uninviting no comfortable seats apart from just 2 coffee tables with  armchairs close to the main entrance.     

With regards to dining the food menu is limited  poor.  We decided on our pre departure stay to order a portion of potato wedges we where informed that they where not available only french fries.  Having agreed to the alternative when they where served we where then told they had no ketchup what hotel does not have ketchup.  On our second stay one week later we decided in the evening to order the wedges surprise surprise sorry not available only fries.

Moving on to breakfast OK but no where near the standard of other Hampton hotels.  In the breakfast buffet area there are  2 coffee machines on our stay prior to departure one was out of order OK things do brake down.  However, again when we returned one week later the coffee machine was still out of order.  

With regards to cleanliness this again is lacking at breakfast we sat down in the dining area and our plates stuck to the table.  Totally unacceptable.

Having previously stayed in The Hampton at both Liverpool and Stanstead Airports where we'd have no hesitation in returning Bristol was far below what we had expected.  Blaming the current situations is not an acceptable excuse as only this year we have stayed 4 times in Stanstead and have received impeccable service and would recommend the hotel to anyone.  Hampton Bristol unless we had  no option we would not stay there again.  The hotel is way below standard.","2","","2022-07-31","2022-07-16","2022-07-16","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r848192128-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We were told to take a seat & someone would be over to talk to us when everything was up and running. As everyone was in the same boat, the queue at the bar was enormous and the servers were going at a snails pace. 

We eventually got our food & drink (which was hot & delicious) and we waited, and we waited. 

We saw that people were once again forming a queue at check in so we guessed that the situation had been resolved - no one had  come round to speak to us & keep us updated. We eventually got into our hotel room just after 10pm.

The B&B rate was around £300 which we thought was a bit steep, but we had no choice as there were only a few rooms left. Fortunately my wife had let them know that we might arrive after midnight and the room was available when we eventually arrived (after a 5 hour flight delay and 2.5 hours wait for our luggage) at 4.30 am! Another couple who had not so informed reception found their room had dropped off the system and was no longer available, although after a lot of whispering and shuffling about by the reception staff, they were eventually accommodated. 
The room was quite small but comfortable, although by the time we got in we only had time for a shower, a short rest and breakfast before setting off on the home journey. 
Considering the price, the breakfast was not wonderful. The buffet was OK and offered a fair choice of items, Although the croissants were dry and hard as if they were several days old!
I had expected an airport hotel to be more prepared for people turning up at odd times. Although the reception staff eventually delivered the goods they did seem to be quite taken aback by people turning up several hours late to take up their booked accommodation. The IT system should take some responsibility for this as it appeared that guests who turned up after midnight without prior warning, were automatically removed as “non- shows”
Overall we felt the experience was less than we had expected from Hilton and was expensive for what was on offer.","0","","2022-06-30","2022-06-23","2022-06-23","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r844192015-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We'd never been to a Hilton hotel before so weren't sure what to expect apart from a semi-upper tier hotel.

The man on reception that checked us in was very chatty and made us feel quite comfortable which was great. I had originally setup the remote room key on my phone but had to reset the device before arriving at the hotel, unfortunately it didn't give me permission to use it due to it ""being a different device"" but it wasn't the end of the world.

The room itself was spotless and had very good sound dampening, I don't think we heard a single plane from the outside and not even anyone in the corridor when we were trying to sleep which was very good, when we had to be up at about 3am for a 6.45am flight.

We appreciated that it is only a five minute walk to the terminal and we also like the fact that although cooked breakfast doesn’t start until later, you can still access some of the continental choice very early in the morning, so you do not miss out totally on breakfast with an early flight.

When we checked in, the bar and restaurant were busy, but we were checked in quickly and efficiently, although it wasn’t overly friendly. The bar area is fine for relaxing, although as with most HbH, the selection of drinks is standard and not very exciting. You are also quite captive here as there is nowhere else to go (other than M&S in the airport terminal).

We were a little anxious about the airport as it was just as the media were hyping up the queues and chaos. We dropped our car and arrived at the hotel. We were greeted by a really friendly lady on reception who couldn’t have been more helpful. The room was clean, spacious and well kept. We went down to the bar for a bite to eat. The food wasn’t earth shattering but it was tasty, hot and decent portions, a little pricey but to be expected in an airport hotel. The menu is not extensive but we didn’t have any problems with choosing. The restaurant was very busy but the staff were all friendly and smiling! We received a breakfast bag the next morning from the reception desk as we were leaving early. It was ok…….a croissant, a cereal bar, banana and a carton of orange juice. Maybe not the best but certainly enough to take the edge off before our flight and as an ‘on the move’ snack, it did the job. We would certainly consider using the hotel again if we fly out of Bristol. 
We also had silver parking at the airport as part of the package. This was very well organised!(we had read bad reports just before we went so we’re anticipating problems…). You drive in, find a parking space and take note of the bay number. In the office you input your booking, including where you are parked, drop your keys and off you go to the shuttle bus. The staff member who was in there was really friendly and helpful. The shuttle bus runs every 15 mins and within 2-3 mins you are at the airport! The return was just as easy and straightforward.","0","","2022-06-30","2022-06-20","2022-06-20","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r843702944-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

This meant we had to be up at 3am and as a result it was very important we got a good night's sleep as soon as possible. We arrived around 8.40pm and another customer told me there had been an issue with ""the system"" and no-one had been checked in for hours. Thankfully people did start getting checked in shortly after we arrived but of course there was a backlog. After travelling by train and bus to get here with two small children they were in no mood to be patient and wrangling them during the wait was trying. One of the receptionists did get my children a glass of water each for which I was thankful, but apart from that there was not even acknowledgement or apology for the situation they were in let alone any kind of compensation for a room that had cost over £200 for what would in the end be 7hrs of total occupancy. 

The room itself was fairly standard for what you'd expect at a chain hotel, if I'd have stayed longer I'd be disappointed at the lack of bath but I wasn't going to have time for that anyway. My children took the double bed and I took the sofa bed and I regret the choice, the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable for an adult, but might be fine for a child. 

I get that a hotel like this can survive fine on the convenience of it's location but I don't think it does the brand much good as a whole that it was overall just a really mediocre experience. I've never stayed at a Hampton before but it doesn't make me feel like I'd choose it over a different option and certainly not a cheaper one of the budget chains.","0","","2022-06-30","2022-06-16","2022-06-16","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r843114385-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We thought there was a charge as there were barriers but apparently you can drive in and get your ticket validated at the desk for one hour free. There was a long queue at check in which seemed to take ages. But the girl was pleasant and friendly and explained everything. Our rooms were together as requested and they all had sofa beds made up although we didn’t need them in all rooms. It was certainly adequate for one night before flying and even had a safe. Soap and shampoo pumps were provided in the bathroom and there was a hairdryer. Tea and coffee also. The bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable and was too close to the bathroom wall on one side so making it difficult for my husband to get in and out of bed ! The room was quiet until people started moving between 3-4 am. 
We had an evening meal which was served fairly quickly considering it was busy and the food was just ok. My husband found the cheese and ham panini rather dry and boring but it was served with a salad and chips. My chicken tikka was nice but had a soggy popadom . There were quite a few other choices including jacket potatoes and burgers. 
We didn’t hang around over breakfast as we had to get over to the airport which was about a ten minute walk away through an undercover walkway which only lasted a short distance so not so good if raining! In all it served a purpose but not cheap for one night at £152!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/23/e6/29/3d/caption.jpg

The hotel was clearly very busy and we were put into a room with twin double beds. This was not ideal and we asked the receptionist if it was possible to have the room we had booked. She moved us to a much nicer room (same footprint but better layout which meant I could share a bed with my husband!).

This was a real 5/5 from us because despite an initial problem the really kind and professional receptionist went out of her way to fix it, and also comped us a couple of drinks which was unexpected and massively appreciated. It has made me much more likely to choose this chain again, knowing that a small hiccup will be dealt with nicely. 

Great staff. Room was comfortable and well proportioned and I like the fact that the toiletries are in dispensers so less plastic waste! The bar was lovely as well with really nice common areas to relax. Late night bar staff were charming and friendly.

In fairness another portion was brought out to me at no additional cost. I ordered a pint of beer and onion rings too. Please be aware that my extra portion of chilli con carne came in a 11 x 5 cm ram-akin dish which is less than 300 ml of sauce and meat. My overall bill was £28.13. I begrudge having to pay for two meals and I don’t feel like I have eaten well. The chef, who was very polite ,informed me that the portion sizes are not determined by him. In future I feel like eating before staying the night before a flight at this hotel. I am a Hilton Diamond member too.

Don’t be fooled by the name ‘Hilton’","Very overpriced , very poor customer service, very expensive and poor restaurant.

Arrived late on a Saturday afternoon. Went to our room to discover the room had not even been cleaned, the bed was left as it was from the previous guests their bed sheets left on the floor. The cleaners who were wondering aimlessly around the corridor didn’t seem to be at all interested in our complaint and were passing the blame onto each other before continuing to chat among themselves doing as little as possible which seems to be what they’re best at. 
We went to reception to be given another room, no help moving our luggage or even a gesture to compensate  such as a free drink or a meal but then we remembered where we were. Hampton by Hilton which is a euphemism for abysmal customer service. Don’t be fooled by the name “Hilton” this is a no frills hotel at premium prices trying to be something that it isn’t. On that day we also enjoyed the pleasure of no running water for quite a while unable to flush toilets, wash or have a drink for some time. Thankfully running water was restored later. 
The rooms have showers but there’s no proper shower door so very soon shower/ toilet room floor becomes like a lake flooded with splashed water! 

Food. The restaurant is more like a canteen only cold and not very comfortable. No table service or welcoming waiters, instead you queue up for highly over priced snacks on a very limited menu. Over £15 for a starter consisting of little chicken bits, chips and a pint of beer! Again providing as little as possible for very high prices. You’re better off eating before you arrive or bringing a packed lunch!
We had a very early flight and normally they should provide bags for a take away breakfast. Breakfast is included in the price but they ran out of bags so we did without which is obviously a great help to this place as they save food which helps with their mission to do as little as possible for very high prices. So we left hungry to venture into the bedlam of Bristol airport with its  chaos and infamously long queues. 

The only good thing is it’s relative proximity to the airport but that’s about all. Not worth the money! 

Seriously do not be fooled by the name ‘Hilton’ this place is the pits!

The only good thing about this hotel is the convenience being on the airport. Unfortunately, it stops there. Don’t be fooled by the name ‘Hilton’
We arrived at approx. 4pm we had 2 rooms booked, I asked about breakfast the next morning because of our early departure, I was told to collect a breakfast bag from reception the following morning.

We arrived into our rooms and ours hadn’t been made it up, it was disgusting.  I went into the corridor and there were about 4 housekeeping staff doing nothing, 
I mentioned the room to them, they just shrugged and didn’t appear interested.  Then they started arguing who should make up the room.
I went to reception and waited about 5 minutes for a receptionist to appear.  She came out of a back office and wasn’t as professional as one would expect she appeared to have just eaten.
I told her about the room,  and the staff arguing, she apologised and decided we should change rooms., at the same time my daughter booked into the next room told reception she had no water at all .  The receptionist apologised and said we should both move rooms, from 1st to 2nd floor.  She gave us new rooms and we had the inconvenience of moving our belongings a floor up, with no offer of help.  We arrived in the new rooms and the sofa bed was not made up!  in addition my daughter needed a cot, someone had to bring a cot and was just dumped in the room.

We had a snack in the restaurant during the evening but had to leave as soon as we had finished because it was so cold we were most uncomfortable, other customers had their coats on.  I understand the need for ventilation, but this was an arctic blast blowing.

The next morning, the breakfast buffet was set up and we went for bags to put the food in,  receptionist told us none left sorry.  I asked what were we supposed to put the food in? she said plenty of seats take a tray  and sit down.  I explained we needed to get to the airport early because of the situation, which is why we need bags.  She said again take a tray and sit down.  She just didn’t understand the situation.  That was that we had no breakfast.

I would not recommend this hotel, we paid £400 for 2 rooms with shocking service and no breakfast, the hotel appears to be running on a shoe string and charging extortionate prices.

For future early flights we shall use a taxi return from Newton Abbot.","2","","2022-06-30","2022-06-05","2022-06-05","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r841620144-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Unfortunately lots of negatives - 

I had emailed the hotel on booking to request rooms next to each other due to us having fairly young children. I received an email back to confirm that the rooms had been pre allocated close together. On arrival, the receptionist clearly had no idea of this agreement, it wasn’t on my booking notes and the rooms that we were given (all that was left) were at opposite ends of the corridor.

The restaurant was very busy and we had to queue for at least 15 minutes each time we wanted a drink and to order food. We waited over an hour for our food which was very average.

The hotel was incredibly noisy and we hardly slept. I appreciate that this is an airport hotel and guests have flights throughout the night to get up for but the walls seemed to be paper thin and we could hear every movement. We also received 3 ‘knock and run’ visits from teenagers running up and down the corridors. 

I had also emailed prior to my visit to ask about parking. I was told to consult the airport website. The airport website did not show the hotel car park as available so I ended up booking a car park further away on the airport site. When we arrived, we realised that it is possible to turn up and pay at the hotel car park which would have been a much better option for us. I’m not sure why this information couldn’t have been shared when I emailed to ask.","1","","2022-05-31","2022-06-05","2022-06-05","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r841608193-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

I din’t imagine anyone comes here by foot, and even anyone flying in would probably hire a car, so when we arrived and there wasn’t a parking space I was surprised. Moreover, the car park is designed so you can only drive through and out again. Having found that there wasn’t a parking space, it demanded £5 to allow us to look again. I went to Reception to remedy this, and predictably on my return there was an angry motorist behind me. Which meant - Ah! - a parking space. But this oversight, and the demand for a fiver merely for looking for a space, are unforgivable. 

Aside from that the hotel is clean and spacious, and the staff were courteous. But typically for an hotel of this class, the shower was a triumph of style over function. The low wall of the shower tray is way too low to accommodate the water it’s supposed to contain, so necessarily a shower of normal length floods the bathroom. 

It’s convenient for an early flight, and for that I’d stay here again.","1","","2022-06-30","2022-06-02","2022-06-01","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r841053002-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Until I got to the room. Whilst I expected it to be “airport hotel” standard with a bit of wear of tear, I didn’t expect it to be so unclean. The bathroom was dirty with baked on tile dirt. The shower tray flooded, the bedside draw was broken, the glassware were dirty, the picture above the bed had a large amount of dust. The room didn’t really look like the hotels professional photos and reminded me of something from a flat pack furniture store.   This is not what I expected from the Hilton brand. On departure at 4am the receptionist just waved and said nothing else. It’s a shame I have another booking for August, I’d never have booked here again if I’d known how below standard it is for an expensive price. Let’s hope by August the rooms are cleaner!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/23/7b/70/1b/hampton-by-hilton-bristol.jpg

This didn't happen.
The reception desk was devoid of staff when we went to validate our parking ticket.  A member of staff went in search but was unsuccessful.

Pre-Covid, if you arrived an early and a room was available you would be able to check in. In big city and airport hotels this was never an issue. Hotels are not booked to full capacity currently and there was always one room available. Today I arrived at the Hampton by Hilton Hotel Bristol Airport at 10am due to a flight connection. The hotel is absolutely dead- you can see by the passenger traffic in the lobby. I was told by the receptionist that despite being a Gold member and despite having called ahead before making the reservation where I was told early check in would be determined on the day, that Hilton do not allow any check ins before 12 pm, even if they have rooms available. This is not the policy of many other chain hotels and I would encourage you to stay elsewhere if you need an early check in. 
I am checking out at 4am and so tomorrow, I hope someone is more fortunate than I am.","1","","2022-04-30","2022-04-11","2022-04-11","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r834135463-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Right by the airport and the bus station. An airport bus took me up there from Temple Meads station. I stayed as I had an early flight at 7.15am, and I was too nervous to drive, so I took the train, but of course there were no trains at that time of the morning, so I decided to stay the night. The hotel is a comfortable, peaceful city style hotel. It has all the amenities needed for a quick overnight stop. There’s a bar and a restaurant. There isn’t a great choice on the menu, but it does the job - something to keep you going until you reach your holiday destination. I had a burger with chips, and it certainly filled me up. The only negative really was the wake up call. I requested a 4.30am wake up call, but received a 3.30am wake up call. I couldn’t get back to sleep then, not that there would have been much point as I would have had less than an hour before I needed to get up, so I just decided to have a cuppa using the facilities in the room, and headed over to the airport a little earlier than planned.

Unfortunately the hotel is let down by the parking which is not managed by them but significantly impacted my stay.  There is a parking area outside the hotel however the display indicates that you have to pay about £5 for 0-2 hours (extortionate for a 5 min drop off) or something like that.  My father dropped me off just outside the parking barrier which took less than a minute but there is no stoping on all roads near the hotel so was fined.  
There is apparently 5min stoping allowed to drop off hotel guests in the parking area however this is not clearly displayed and I find it deceitful that it is not clearly displayed.  I think this happens to guests regularly as the staff were not surprised by what happened and informed me that the airport manages the parking.  Apparently in the second paragraph it says you can drop off guests (not on the fee information)  and they had requested that the signage be clearer but the airport had not done this.  I think it is a purposeful set up to fine as many people as possible to create revenue.  The car with the camera was there in seconds so I guess they wait nearby for people to make the same mistake over and over again at £60 a go!

If the signage would have been clear we would have used the parking and could have said good bye properly. This would have been much more preferable!

However the hotel was nice, basic but clean and I would stay again. The parking situation however has left a bad feeling so will be avoiding Bristol airport when possible!  Unfortunately the parking situation that is not in their control negatively affects my opinion.","1","","2022-02-28","2022-03-08","2022-03-08","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r830477690-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Our meal was a worse experience than sitting in a motorway service area. 

The food was ultra bland but eclipsed by the SkySports football commentary being played to the entire restaurant by the occupants of a nearby table who cried out with the crudest of four letter language at every refereeing decision or offside. 

It was mentioned to staff but nothing was done about it. 

We will try somewhere else for our airport stay next time.","1","","2022-03-31","2022-03-06","2022-03-06","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r830277586-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We came back again in February 2022 and had a better stay. The room was comfortable, the second bed was made up and they were quick to deal with any requests we had. The only issue we had was we had a room was near the bus station so it was quite noisy but I think that is just luck for which room you get.

the food is quite expensive here but it is nice and hot. We had pizzas and it is good to see they changed their supplier back to the old one. It was also an added bonus that you can get cooked breakfast from 6am now too.

The staff were friendly and they will do anything to help you. I would definitely visit again.","0","","2022-02-28","2022-03-05","2022-03-05","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r830164464-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Shame about the check out.","This is a standard 'Hampton by Hilton' so anyone familiar with the brand, will know exactly what to expect.

Check in went smoothly, dinner was OK, my bed was very comfortable and breakfast was standard  Hampton.

The only disappointment was on checkout. The woman behind the desk (morning shift 24/02) appeared to regard customers as a HUGE inconvenience. I asked her to call me a taxi and she behaved as if this was an unreasonable request and when I asked for a paper copy of the bill, she reacted as if I had asked for something so out of the ordinary, she could barely believe it.

If I ran this hotel, I would probably find her a different job, where she would feel less inconvenienced by the customers whose money pays here wages.","1","","2022-02-28","2022-02-24","2022-02-24","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r829117115-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Accordingly, to minimise stress and give the holiday a good start, we chose to sleep at the airport on the night before departure.  We chose this hotel because it allowed parking for the duration of the holiday, at an extra cost, actually on the aiport estate.  We could then walk to the terminal.  Mobility impaired dedicated parking is available and the hotel has step free access.  Our room was located upstairs (via lift) along a carpeted corridor.  Our window looked out onto the multi-storey car park.  The cost of our stay included breakfast, with a 'continental' option available from 0400 and the 'Full English' from 0600.  Our flight departure time enabled us to partake of the full English option and it didn't disappoint.  We found that a nice touch was the availability of ""to go"" coffee cups and the opportunity to ""take away"" croissants and pastries.  We took the pastries onto the aircraft saving the exorbitant, sky high even, cost of in-flight food.  Access from the hotel to the terminal is from the ground floor, via a covered walkway which is auto-illuminated, leading to steps/ramp to a Zebra-crossing and then further steps/ramp to a further Zebra-crossing leading to the arrivals door.  Our only negative was a slow draining shower tray - ""Mr Muscle"" could probably assist - but this isn't enough to downgrade the overall rating.  All staff were very helpful and mindful of covid restrictions.  Signage from the main A38 was excellent and we arrived into the hotel car park without mishap.  The barrier gave us a ticket, which when inserted on departure worked perfectly.  We were very happy with our stay.  We had a comfortable, quiet night.  Just a five minute walk to the terminal and a good start to our sunshine break.

Trays for your breakfast which you stack up when finished, food is poor and selection is limited. Poached eggs aren’t even an option at breakfast. They apparently would take too long for them to cook.
The coffee machine; I selected hot water and brown gunk came out. 
If you have to leave early the continental breakfast is poor or not available as there’s no kitchen staff working until later on. 
The Evening food selection is no better. 
The beds are super uncomfortable as are the pillows. Both very hard.  What you would think was like sleeping on a mortuary slab.

I would definitely stay again if I were to fly out of Bristol Airport.","0","","2021-11-30","2021-11-16","2021-11-16","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r818932830-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Room with sofa bed & footstool was super clean (well done to the Housekeeping team) and very comfortable, with plenty of space and even a desk with office type chair.
The bar/restaurant area is well set out. Enjoyed a drink with friends in the evening, with a good atmosphere. Breakfast the next morning was something to look forward to - usual hot selection (eggs, bacon, sausages etc) as well as cereals, fruit (grapefruit very good), selection of breads & pastries and even a waffle machine. There was a press button coffee machine & selection of fruit teas too.
Hotel is right at the airport, you just follow the signs, cross the road and walk directly to it under a covered walkway. It is geared up for guests getting flights, with useful monitors in the seating areas displaying live flight arrivals & departures.
Check out is 11, but no problem hanging around in the seating areas to wait for flights/people arriving.
Covid safety measures have all been thought through and implemented and I found the staff to be friendly and efficient. The reception guy kindly rejigged my booking so that I could check in earlier, as soon as I arrived, and changed my room from a twin to a double, which I appreciated. I’m sorry I didn’t get his name, but I checked in at around 2.30pm. He provided excellent customer service, and deserves a mention.
All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It’s around £100 per night for 2 people (depending on when you book) including breakfast, so not budget end, but it gave me a relaxing start to the Hen weekend.","2","","2021-11-30","2021-11-12","2021-11-12","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r818388145-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

As it stands, you’ve driven hours to get to your departure airport to overnight before a red-eye flight and you are faced with mass-produced, industrial fayre - burgers, deep fried ‘salt & pepper’ (?) squid rings and cardboard frozen pizzas - that are full of bad calories and are of little nutritional value.

You then give that back to your taxi/drop off and they can leave. They need to put this info on the Parking/Directions page as its not clear either before or on arrival - as noted by many others. 

1 pillow per person is so bad, it's funny. Cost, covid? No idea why - but the least ANY hotel of any class should do is provide 2 pillows per person. You can ask for more, and they were delivered quickly but whether to save laundry during covid or cost - whatever the reason they really should have 2 pillows in rooms. Its not a hostel. 

FOOD - Food was better than others have indicated. Menu was limited and I think if you go in thinking ""pub food from the 90's"" (not a bad thing) then you'll enjoy a decent meal. I can understand why others would expect more from an Airport hotel from a major brand, but it was just OK enough. 

ROOMS - rooms were fine (except the pillows) and a 3-5 min easy (uphill/steps) walk to the Airport was nice for a 6am flight. 

STAFF - I found staff helpful and friendly, especially our check in lady who doubled as our bar server and waitress too! However, there was one team member (I think the same one as referred to in many other reviews) who seemed  'abrasive' and lacking friendliness and a smile. I have to stay this team member also seemed very efficient and knowledgeable and I think their desire for efficiency and speed sometimes came across as unfriendly and unhelpful. Training would fix that. 

COVID UNSAFE - All front of house staff wore masks but no housekeeping staff had any masks on at all. I came across at least 4 housekeeping staff and none were wearing masks despite operating in tight hallways and the ones I saw made no effort to get out of the way forcing you to squeeze past them in close proximity with them wearing no masks. 

Worst some housekeepers seemed to be coughing and sneezing whilst inside cleaning rooms and in the air starved corridors - so whatever left their mouth or nose is now in your room, on your bedding, on surfaces. I also witnessed COVID cleaning protocols totally ignored and clear cross contamination between rooms (cleaning multiple rooms at same time, mixing items, etc). Terrible practice for the current times. 

The hotel was ""just OK"" (except the covid unsafe stuff) and the poor rating really reflects the fact that many of the issues raised in previous reviews (info on drop off on website, food range/quality, attitude of some staff, have clearly just been ignored over a long period. Just read the reviews - all these issues have been mentioned multiple times. 

I hope this review helps the management focus in on areas of concern and fix them - as they can all be easily fixed with the right management.","3","","2021-08-31","2021-09-01","2021-09-01","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r807644776-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

I like how this hotel have shower rooms in all rooms and beds are comfortable. They are on the little small side but they are perfect for a few days stay. 

The main thing that is letting this hotel down is the quality of the food menu for a Hilton branded hotel it is very poor and the cheapest of cheap food is ordered from the suppliers i know Hampton by Hilton is meant to be budget friendly to compete with the likes of Travelodge and premier inn but most of the time premium prices are paid for the rooms here. For example this time  i paid £213 per night for the room. 

I definitely feel this hotel would be better has a Hilton Garden Inn especially when the Holiday Inn around a Mile or two down the road offers a very good menu. 

I have stopped in both Travelodge and premier inn airport hotel's and both have better quality food and menu's available.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1d/c2/52/81/caption.jpg

We found the staff to be friendly and very efficient and they gace the impression that they seriously cared about looking after their guests.

Breakfast was excellent given the restrictions placed on the hotel by the Covid regulations. The menu for the evening meal was limited and service was a little slow but the food was excellent when it arrived.

We checked in, got our key and made our way to our room. It was reassuring to see a paper seal on the door, which stated that the room had been deeply cleaned, we had to break the seal to enter. 

Our twin bedroom was bright, modern, very clean and well maintained. It was equipped with an iron, ironing board, television, hair dryer, tea and coffee making facilities were also provided. 

There was an air conditioning / heater unit in the room, we could not get the heater bit to work, the room was a bit chilly. 

As there were no bars or restaurants about we were limited to the facilities at the hotel. 

The bar, dining area and reception were all located in the vast modern open plan area on the ground floor. 

Two people working, reception, the bar and taking food and drink orders as well as serving them.  Caroline and  Becky worked hard to ensure that all guests were well looked after, all done in a cheerful manner. 

In accordance with COVID 19 safety measures we sat at a table, indicating we were ready to order drinks and food. Everything was delivered to the table, all table service. 

A pint of larger and ale was £8.30, reasonably priced and a lot less than we expected to pay 

There was a small food menu consisting of burgers, pizza, or a broccoli bake, we were informed by our waitress that there were 2 curry dishes of the day. 

We ordered chicken tikka masala and a red lentil Dahl which were served with rice and 2 small naan breads £11.95 each. It was rather tasty. 

As we were leaving, in the morning, before breakfast started, food bags were available for collection as we left. This consisted of a croissant, pain au chocolat, a banana and a juice. 

Overall we were very satisfied with all aspects of our stay, except that everywhere in the hotel was a bit cold, too cold for the time of year. 

Good food, reasonably priced drinks, really great staff, comfortable clean room, a good night's sleep and competitive room rates.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/54/5b/a9/20201103-191254-largejpg.jpg

Our friend dropped us at the entrance to the hotel pay car park. He later received a fine notice from VCS for £100 for stopping less than one minute as we got our cases out of his car. He was not causing any obstruction, he did not get out off the car, he was off the main road,  there was no one else around and he had a blue badge! He appealed to VCS but it was dismissed. We had not been warned in advance by the hotel about stopping or the alternative parking arrangements to use the hotel car park and claim back the charge There was nothing on their website to indicates a drop off facility. When we contacted the hotel after receiving the fine the hotel staff were not sympathetic but agreed that it had not been made clear to us at the time of booking and there was nothing on their website about it. They said there was nothing they could do about the fine.
We had also ordered an early morning breakfast from the hotel. This was a fruit juice, coffee and croissants. When we tried to eat this before walking to the airport we were told we couldn't consume it in the hotel restaurant because of covid-19 restrictions, yet they were serving meals in the dining area the evening before! The alternative was to have it in our room which by this time we had vacated. We had not been warned about this in advance.  I asked the hotel staff where we could sit down to have our breakfast at the airport before going through security and they said they didn't know (and seemed to not care either). So we ended up having to have carry our breakfast along with our luggage to the airport. When I fed this back to the hotel afterwards I received no apology or any recognition of the problem. This hotel is certainly not customer friendly and we will not be staying here again. 
Overall Bristol Airport seems to want to stop people flying as it used to be possible to drop passengers off for free (10 mins max) but now it costs £4. At this rate it will soon be £100 or maybe they would prefer to stop people flying all together!

Room
The room was clean on arrival and i like how every room had a walk in low profile shower. I originally stopped here from the 24th August to the 26th august and the shower kept filling up i reported this on checkout. I checked back into the hotel on the 28th August and thought I would check into the same room and guess what the shower still kept filling up so my repair log basically went ignored which I found to be very poor.

Food
The food is very poor the dinner choices in the restaurant is extremely limited the burgers were dry and tasteless the best burger i had which isn't displayed on the menu is the quorn burger I found that was fairly meaty. For the overall quality of the food it is overpriced and a complete let down to have the hilton name attached to it, i am aware of hamptons business model of a limited food menu but that doesn't mean the food has to be low quality and generally food I would find in Iceland. Even the pizzas were poor they were very dry with not much cheese on and even that is frozen. 

Staff First of all I would like to give a shout out to the following staff members who provided provided good customer service and went above and beyond Stuart from night staff, Anna, jasmine from night staff who helped me resolve the overcharge issue and spent two hours with me to resolve it she should definitely be manager. Sadly the night staff were a lot better than the day staff I found a lot of the day staff to be lazy and i even had a situation where a member of the bar staff ""Tony"" refused to carry some drinks over to my table with being disabled and using a walking stick i can generally only manage to carry one drink at a time, i asked Tony if he could carry the drinks over to my table has i had 4 drinks and he said I can't do that but i can give you a tray, i clearly made it clear it was only to my table but when i made a complaint he lied and said he thought i meant taking the drinks to the room which I didn't mention at any time.

Overcharged 
After 7 days of stopping in the hotel has i used the hotel has a base for my stay caution when it was due to checkout at the end of my booked days my illnesses were flaring up so I kept extending my room on a daily basis. Well after a few days of being in the hotel i checked my bank account via cash point and figured that i had some money missing from my account. I checked with the hotel and they said everything that was charged on the bill was right but something still didn't add up. Well two days passed and I found some receipts and the remembered hotel kept wanting me to preauthorise some funds for the bar has after 10pm you can only charge to room which i was fine with at the time. But when i had my final invoice the hotel didn't take off the funds from my invoice that i preauthorised the bill was £1453 but yet the hotel pre authorised £1845 which is way too much meaning I couldn't spend that money and the hotel didn't release it back to my card. 

For anyone aware of most hotels the hotel shouldn't generally take no more than £50 to £100 pre auth then any charges take off the amount already preauthorised and any money left over after charges release back onto card and do that every 24 hours. Well this hotel didn't do any of that they took money charged from my account and kept almost £400. So if you are going to stop at this hotel keep a careful track of your balance and try and do everything pay as you go rather than charge to the room.

Parking is charged at £8per day which is reasonable for a airport hotel although most people do only stop for 1 night unless stopping there on business i think for stays of 3 or more nights they should have a cheaper rate where you can buy in advance of say £5 per day.

Overall it is a nice modern hotel has plenty of disabled parking spaces although having a disabled badge doesn't give you free parking i often stop at Travelodge in Gatwick when flying from there and disabled badge holders get free parking there and that's Travelodge which is a lower class of hotel so i think Hilton should offer it to their disabled guests. The hotel is generally open plan. With everything that has happened I don't think i will stop here again next time i will stopping in the Holiday inn which is located 2 miles down the road and offer a free shuttle to the airport.

The room was clean and new with basic furniture, the lounge area had no soul and was like a waiting room, and the menu was so limited that you could have found more variety at a roadside snack caravan. The hotel car park and surrounding entrance belongs to Bristol Airport and any unwary traveller stopping to read direction notices faces a fine of £100 - and staff assured me that many had been caught. The management explained that they were operating under Covid 19 restrictions but so were the other hotels in our trip, and they managed to provide a far more comfortable experience. On the upside the airport is right on the doorstep, but I certainly wont be using this place again. I also noted that the bill showed on my credit card as being paid on the day of arrival, but was still there eight days later as a pending charge. I had to phone twice to have the duplicate amount removed.","2","","2020-09-30","2020-09-22","2020-09-22","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r771440830-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Best of all was the continental breakfast which was available from 4am.  There was plenty of choice and if you were in a rush to get to departures, as we were, there were bags you could take already filled with fresh fruit and cereal bars and you could add whatever you wanted from the continental buffet plus the hot drinks were given in handy takeaway containers.

We arrived at the Hampton By Hilton ( HBH ) and asked if they could accommodate us, fortunately they could. The reception area was very impressive, smart, spacious and welcoming. We were registered efficiently , and given our room, which was spacious , comfortable , beautiful beds, good power shower , TV , coffee and tea facilities, a sign on the door and a seal , saying that the room had been sterilised , and it really was spotless.
It was beautifully quiet , and a comfortable environment in which to stay . The cleanliness really impressed us , especially with the current situation with Covid. There was sanitiser in the room too.
In the reception , the bar was functional , and we enjoyed a couple of drinks, and then we booked a table for dinner, menus all done via QR code , really good, hygienic and functional.
The menu although limited, was excellent , I enjoyed a very nice burger and my other half enjoyed a pizza !
The hotel is a few minutes walk from the main terminal , so very handy. Normally , I would have booked the airport parking for an extra night, but as this was a last minute booking , we had to pay the HBH rather high overnight charge of £ 16.50.
Staff here were fabulous , very friendly , welcoming and very Covid aware.

The hotel is in easy walking-distance from the terminal. I guess 200 meters. 

The hotel seems to be very new and very clean.

The rooms and bathrooms have a good size.  There is lots of available space for car-parking ‘next door’. 

The staff we met were nice and helpful.

They seem to be taking covid-19 very seriously. This had seriously affected their breakfast and made it simpel, but sufficient. If your flight is very early, breakfast is available from 0400.

I am glad we choose this hotel for the one night we had to stay close to the airport.","2","","2020-07-31","2020-07-26","2020-07-26","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r761575662-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The bar serves drinks and also takes the food orders. The drinks were overpriced and the food less than appetising, all served in a public seating area that had less ambience that a factory warehouse. The management might also get a grip with customer service. Our accommodation was a pre-booked Queen Room with a bed that proved extremely uncomfortable. On the basis of our evening experience we chose not to sample the breakfast offering. The only redeeming feature of our stay, was the early morning call that was on time.","3","","2020-03-31","2020-03-18","2020-03-18","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r751322538-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

As aresult of that experience, we booked again for March, 2020, prior to our trip to Rome. Covid-19 resulted in easyJet cancelling our flights. We contacted the various providers for our trip and had the following responses:-
easyJet - full refund of all flight and associated payments
Private taxi firm for transfers in Rome - full refund less £10 cancellation fee.
Mercure Roma Centro Colloseum Hotel, Rome - they have offered to keep our reservation open and honour it for 9 months, despite it being a non refundable booking. Bless them- they didn't have to at all.
People and businesses in Rome are experiencing a devastating collapse in their tourist trade and yet they have the decency to try all they can to accomodate travellers. Good on them and great foresight as those travellers will return.
Now to the Hilton Hotel at Bristol and their response. Via Booking.Com, we requested not a refund but that we simply be allowed to change the booking so that we could reserve a room in July when we are due to travel to Krakow. The trip to Rome was for our 35th wedding anniversary and my wife has an autoimmune condition called Sarcoidosis which affects her lungs. Despite Booking.Com, in their words, 'reaching out' to Hilton, their response was a flat refusal to move the date of our booking. We are going through an unprecedented time in the world at the moment when what we need to see is compassion and selfless acts as displayed by the operators in Rome. What do we see from Hilton? Pure greed and total intransigence.

I had already checked in and got my digital key so made my way to my chosen room.  It took a few attempts before I made it into the room.. The room was cold and unwelcoming. Initially the TV did not work but after some time I realised that the electrical lead had been removed from the back of it.
In the morning I took a shower which wet the whole of the bathroom floor and I had to use a second towel to wipe it up.
The room was average of  Travelodge standard and vastly overpriced at £96.00 for what was about a 9 hours stay. The only positive is the location especially late at night as an alternative to going into Bristol. I am a HHonors member but am unlikely to stay at this Hotel again unless the price is more competitive.","3","","2020-03-31","2020-03-09","2020-03-09","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r750125834-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

My son was dropping me off at the hotel. It was dark and foggy. He drove around to car park where there was a gate and no clear drop off place. I got out of the car and went into the hotel to ask why it was so difficult to drop off. In the mean time my son drove in through barrier gate, parked and came into the hotel. The reception manager said that the process is that one should drive in ( obviously without pausing) and park. Then bring ticket into hotel for it to be verified then person dropping you off can get out of car park. My son then said goodbye and left. Not exactly an easy drop off. 
Since then we have had a ticket fine for £60 for stopping. We challenged it and showed evidence of the car park ticket. Our appeal has been rejected so, rather than have high blood pressure, we have paid. So BEWARE if you plan to be dropped off at Bristol Airport Hilton. If the hotel happens to read this perhaps they could put a warning on the booking email?

Bed was very comfy and no noise from outside but we had a bad sleep because pillows were way too soft and flat.

Everything worked well in our room. Only hairdryer wasn't very powerful. Housekeeping had done the great job. Room was very tidy and clean.

Ideal for early morning flights at Bristol airport. You could ask for takeaway bags at reception if you wish. We check out at 4am and had a nice continental breakfast while listening to 3 Receptionists laughing and chatting pretty loud at the front desk until we left at 4.30am....Many guests were having breakfast but they all were quieter than those 3. We could hear them since the lift was opened at lobby floor 😓

Dinner was a basic affair with limited choice on the menu, but the food came promptly, was hot and tasty. All you could ask for really.

Nice to at last have a hotel at Bristol airport 

Several flights of steps to go down outside to access the hotel.  Difficult with heavy suitcases.  No obvious signs for accessible entrance ....  disappointing 

Pleasant open space and warm welcome 

Had Queen size room. Felt it was designed for one occupant not a couple. Good sized comfortable bed but very close to one wall so difficult to access from one side.  

Excellent bathroom - with good shower and toiletries

Complementary breakfast from 4 to 10 made us smile.  At over £110 a night it was clearly included in the price and many early morning travellers wouldn’t want it anyway- rather grabbing something at the airport. So good marketing?

We went down to breakfast at around 9 45.  Plentiful food left with just a few gaps.  Good choice well displayed.  Had the cooked breakfast - not sure the scrambled eggs had ever seen a fresh egg, but generally OK. 

Went back to get a second coffee and toast - to find the door had been shut - and breakfast finished on the dot of 10!   So don’t be late even if you have arrived late at night!

Parked the car and took the shuttle to the airport and then walked down the slope to the hotel, very short walk and part was under a covered walkway which lit up when you entered so felt very secure. 

Front desk staff were not overly cheerful but did offer an early morning call. Room was adequate although the bathroom could have been cleaner, particularly the shower floor. The main issue was the noise of the air con/shower fan which was rather noisy and distracting, particularly when you only booked to get some sleep before getting up at 3:30. 

As we had a very early flight we had breakfast shortly after four, very good selection, more than we were expecting for a cold breakfast and then only a short walk uphill to the airport.

Overall a decent stay and would recommend. 
Good choice of breakfast, continental from 4 in the morning and hot buffet from 6 am. I am a Hilton Honors Gold Card carrier and the standard arguably puts this Hampton top of he pile. Would stay there again and recommend – unlike Hampton Stansted Airport which is a disgrace to the brand.

Check in was swift as I had used the app to choose a room earlier that day so had my key card within seconds of saying my name. It helped that there were 3 staff and only a couple of customers I guess, but its still the quickest I have ever checked in to any hotel.
Room was clean, bed was comfortable and a nice walk in shower area. Couldn't fault it.
Breakfast in the morning was only a buffet (it was 5.00AM) but it was fine.
Guess we could have gotten cheaper accommodation somewhere but it wouldn't have been anywhere near as convenient as this place.

Check in was easy although being dropped off in the hotel car park will cost the driver £2 for up to 20 minutes! 
Check in and check out was easy. Hotel room was very nice, modern and clean. Good location to the the airport, literally only a 5 minute walk and has ramps to the terminal which is good when you’re lugging a large suitcase around. 
Food was mediocre but can’t complain when breakfast was included for free and started at 6am which was good for us as we had to be at the airport for 6:30am.

I’m fact, of you have a rented car, you don’t need to keep it for the night if staying here (!). It’s a modern place and straight forward hotel, with good beds. The shower was not completely clean though and had some hairs of previous visitor. The staff is helpful and friendly with a particular positive remark for front desk officer Jez! The food however is of mediocre quality at best. The burger meat was dry as it can be. The only positive thing I can say about the breakfast is that it starts at 4am already, so you can grab a cup of coffee and something to eat even with the earliest flights (on weekdays, in weekends it starts at 6).

The food however (I think) falls well below the Hampton standard . They specialise in a “special” - curry which was well received by my colleague.

Sleep Quality: 2","So disappointing","Chose to stay at this hotel on our return from a Christmas break to see our daughter in France, mainly because of the proximity to the airport.  We both have walking difficulties and had been led to believe that this hotel could be approached very easily via a windy but level path.  Nobody mentioned the two flights of steps before we reached the hotel and the quite long walk to the hotel.  Never mind, we thought, nearly there.  When I booked I asked for a room close to the lift because of the problems we have walking.  You can imagine our dismay to find that our room was just about as far from the lift as you can get - right at the end of the corridor.  By this time we were tired, hot and ""cross"". 

""Lets go and get something to eat"", we thought as we had not eaten since morning and it was now around 8.00pm.   We decided  we should tell the reception staff about the disregard of our request for an accessible room and, in fairness, the young man we spoke to apologised and offered to move us - bit late by this time.  

Anyway, food.  The menu was an A4 piece of paper that listed mainly over-priced pizza, burgers and curry, none of which we eat so we decided to pay £5.50 for a cheese and tomato sandwich each.  When we went to order we were told that there could be at least a half hour wait - for a damned sandwich!  So we decided to trek back to the room and eat the crisps we had in our bags and crack open the duty free whisky instead.

We decided to try and get some sleep, only to realise that the bed was so close to the wall that neither of us could get in or out of it so I slept the night in the armchair with a dressing gown over me. Great stuff.

Breakfast was obviously going to be the highlight of our stay but, again, very disappointing as the self-service hot food wasn't and the selection was pathetic.  In fairness,  the machine coffee was quite nice and the cold food seemed quite varied.  The toaster worked well - bonus!!  The one good thing was that the lady who was clearing up could see we were struggling to collect food with a tray (its difficult to  balance plates on a tray when you walk with a stick) and asked immediately if she could help.  Our sincere thanks to her.

In short, we will not be staying at this hotel again no matter how ""close"" it is to the airport.","1","","2019-12-31","2020-01-12","2020-01-12","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r738691678-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Stay the night, it really could not be more convienient and the staff could not be mire helpful.

They're 24 hours, so if this happens to you just phone them and they'll make sure to expect you. Also, 24 hour food menu and bar area was a godsend. The ladies on reception were absolutely brilliant and really welcoming, we were tired and hungry, and we looked like we'd been dragged through a hedge, but they made us feel at home. 

The room was amazing, seriously comfy bed, armchair- my husband loved this- and a lovely clean and spacious bathroom with toiletries. Check in and out was simple too.

We will definitely never use another hotel in the area when flying from Bristol, we were really impressed. See you soon!!","1","","2019-12-31","2019-12-30","2019-12-30","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r735576205-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Due to weather conditions our flight into Bristol was delayed by 5 1/2 hours. I telephoned reservations on landing at 23:45. Reservations agent very polite and professional and offered us a choice of rooms (lucky this was not summer as I’m sure they would have been sold out). She gave clear instructions on how to reach the hotel and even though we couldn’t see it due to foggy conditions we made our way easily- walking with suitcases about 5minutes. Warm welcome from our checkin agent and his colleague. Professional, polite and prompt with our key and instructions on WIFI and breakfast. Our twin room was very quiet, clean and comfortable and my fussy husband loved the soft pillows. Excellent hot walk in shower. Towels good quality but not 5* fluffy. Tea coffee kettle in room. Only gripe (and I have this in every hotel no matter if it’s Suoer Deluxe or B&B) was the aircon/heating - I never can find out how it works! 
Breakfast - Good help yourself choice of full English or Continental breakfast with fruit, cereals, waffles +++ Fresh tea or coffee or fruit juice to help yourself. 
I believe the hotel also has its own parking (check with hotel)

We recommended the hotel to family and friends and will continue to do so.","2","","2019-12-31","2019-12-01","2019-12-01","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r730090507-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Good staff on the front desk. Lift up to rooms. We stayed in an executive room.
Big, clean room with a very very comfortable queen sized bed with two pillows each. Bathroom was also large with a shower.
Very quiet, I didn't hear any planes or other guests and had a really good sleep.
You can get a car parking ticket validated at the front desk for a reduced fee, or free if someone is just picking you up.
I'm a big fan of the airport hotel when I've got an early departure or late arrival, and I'd highly recommend the Hampton if you're not on too much of a budget.

Disliked · Very minor stuff
The signage from the terminal only says 'Hotel', not specifically Hampton. I guessed there was only this one, but it was possible that another had been built since the last Google Maps picture. Not the case, as it turns out.
Quite expensive but on par for many other airport hotels so I suppose it's just what you pay for the convenience.
Breakfast was a little all over the place - crockery didn't match the food it was near.
View into the internal courtyard of the hotel - we're from Australia so it would have been nice to look out over green English fields.
As I said, very minor things.","1","","2019-06-30","2019-12-01","2019-11-30","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r729909690-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Enjoyed an overnight stay here on the ground level. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The room was very nice and tidy. The WiFi was fast and it was easy to connect to. The shower was warm with towels provided. 

I do like the boards of live flight times on the wall. Very helpful indeed. The location is great as it's right next door to the front of the Bristol Airport Terminal. 
 
The food and the breakfast menu was alright apart from it needed more vegetarian options to be honest. 

The only negative was there was a fire alarm on the night of stay on Sunday 27th October 2019. There was confusion on what happened. Hopefully it was a one off.

We had one of those dreaded, early morning departures that bedevil holidays. We live in south Wales, but most holiday arrangements require journeys to other airports, rather than our preferred Cardiff, and our 10 day visit to Madeira was once such. Nevertheless we had a welcome surprise when we drove to the airport the day before our flight, having booked with Holiday Extras parking and overnight accommodation, to walk the short distance from the drop-off point at the terminal with Silver Zone parking to this well-appointed hotel. Rooms were large, beds spacious, and all spotlessly clean, and after a modestly priced meal we retired early to enjoy a restful nights sleep. Booking out early the following day at the 24 hour reseption was a doodle, then a short walk back to the terminal for our flight, but not before one of the most gruesome so-called breakfast rolls from the airports coffee bar. A tip, all the other eating places offer a slighly more expensive, but ultimately much more satifying fare.

The rooms are not too big but suitable for a one night stopover stay. Big reception area and breakfast from 4am!

Only negative is that the staff don't respond to emails as I was trying to find out before my stay what evening meals were available; so they lost a potential sale of four adult meals+drinks. Did get a written apology when I mentioned it, particularly annoyed as I am a Diamond HHonors member.

Check in experience could have been better rather slow.

Rooms quite basic and small offering shower rooms only, and quite cool.  Housekeeping could be better prepared for incoming guests.

The restaurant menu very disappointing not offering popular dishes, apart from curry.  Pies and mash, but little else appetising.  No fish and chips, they have fish cakes but they are curry rice fishcakes.  Caesar salad jacket potatoes but little else.  I know this is not the fault of this particular hotel but will be a standard Hampton Hilton menu. No cookies on arrival. 

The hotel does not have a warm feeling about it in comfort or feeling.  

The access to the airport is approx 5 mins with a partial covered walkway, but using the ramp access to the terminal makes the walk about 5 mins.  Otherwise by steps about 3 mins.

The hotel is very convenient for the airport which is what this airport needs due to its position and very few hotels in the immediate vicinity.

I would recommend this hotel for convenience only.  It needs something down with the lounge/restaurant area providing comfort and warmth. Together with an improved menu.

The rooms are nice and clean however there are no amenities. I didn't bring my toothbrush and the hotel had sold out of them. Luckily a shop in the airport (a short walk from the hotel) was open and I was able to buy one. One criticism is that there is no free parking for guests (something I would have expected for the price paid for the room). I would return due to the location of this property but Hilton could do better here.","1","","2019-07-31","2019-10-25","2019-10-25","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r721302262-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Yes a booking was made with the best intentions so the non refundable option was chosen, who would pre plan thinking one of the biggest travel bookers would go bust.  

All they could offer was a nights stay in this hotel only which serves no benefit to anyone living 2 hours away with the intention to use only prior to going on holiday.  Would have gladly taken an offer to use a ‘in name only’ sister Hilton hotel, one that would be both practical and logical.

It is a beautiful new clean and spacious building. The room was really lovely, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. It was completely soundproof and made for a lovely night of sleep. 

I chose to eat there in the evening. Big mistake. It starts with trying to find a menu and then queuing to place an order before returning to a table. Several of the tables were unclean and had stray glasses and napkins even though there was no one sitting at them for a long time. 

I chose to have two appetisers and no main course. I had chicken wings and spring rolls which were possibly the most horrible dishes I have had in a hotel. 
They tasted like they were taken out of a party pack and the spring rolls were over cooked to a terrible level. Both were accompanied by a limp salad with an overripe tomato and a cursory splash of some type of dressing. 

I dreaded what breakfast would be like and it turned out to be top notch. Tasty, hot, spotlessly presented in a lovely self service area. Couldn’t fault it in any way.

Very close to Airport via directions from a very kind man working in WHSmith. ( not greatly signposted from airport).
Staff very friendly, rooms comfortable, breakfast was delicious and scrambled eggs had me craving for more.
But unfortunately as we had another flight to catch my sorry little portion had to be it.. that was until 10 days later after a flight delay and resulting in our missed connecting flight onwards to Newcastle we had kindly been put back into this hotel for the night by flight company.
Again they were great, after waiting 10 minutes for the email to be received we were given our room along with vouchers for an evening meal.
Again could not fault the food.
And made sure I had a little more scrambled eggs at breakfast.
As they have flight screens around you don’t feel stressed or rushed and can relax knowing your not far from where you need to be.
We will definitely stay again even if our flight no longer leaves from Bristol but to have a look around as it looks very beautiful the country side and the people are the nicest I’ve had the pleasure to meet.

A short five minute walk along a clearly signposted path leads you directly into Arrivals Terminal where. My room was clean, bright an airy. A shower tray rather than a bath/shower makes getting in and out of shower easy; no need to carefully negotiate climbing over a bath. The hotel has similar amenities to other comparable budget hotels although there is a more relaxed feel here. No automated checkin machines, instead an open plan attractive reception area where friendly staff will assist you. Hotel has a drop off car park (I understand it's one hour free parking); but, if you require more time the short stay car park is cheaper. The downside to this hotel is that it doesn't have a restaurant. There is a bar menu and a relaxed open plan seating area; but the food and coffees I ordered were very disappointing indeed. Finally, it is worth joining the IHG Rewards Club as you'll get offers on room rates, and you'll be able to check in to your room sooner.","1","","2019-09-30","2019-09-04","2019-09-04","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r706345639-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel in very conveniently situated about 4 or 5 mins walk from the terminal building with options of steps or slopes walkways if you have big cases.

The rooms are clean, quiet and not too warm (air con is there if you need it).  We booked a family room for 2 adults and 2 children and the only downside is that the 2 children are accommodated on a sofa bed which looks to be a very small double.  If you have bigger kids it’s a bit of a squeeze and by all accounts not the comfiest sofa bed they’ve ever slept on.

We ate in the restaurant that evening - although it was pretty busy service was quick and food was good.  The menu is mostly burgers, pizzas, ribs and such but we were happy with the choice and prices were fair.

We didn’t have breakfast before we left, preferring to get checked in and through airport security beforehand, so can’t comment on that offer.

We booked a package that included silver parking - which all worked very smoothly too and saved a little on booking separately.

We thought it would be good, we could enjoy an evening together then have a decent breakfast before our flight. We asked for an early morning call for the two rooms, fortunately I woke and looked at my watch, it was 30 minutes after the call was meant to be made. We quickly got dressed and went to the reception and asked why we hadn't had a call, apparently the had a computer  problem causing us to be left out of the calls.
We had to pick up a few items for our breakfast and run, not the pleasant morning we were expecting to have.
As this is an hotel used purely for flights I feel this was a serious mistake by them.","1","","2019-07-31","2019-08-31","2019-08-30","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r704832873-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Great nights Sleep. ","As this was our first flight from Bristol, we didn’t know the airport or surroundings. Our late night flight arrived at 1am so we decided not to drive home but book a night at the only onsite hotel.

Brilliant. It’s 2 mins walk out of the terminal, and we were in bed within 15 mins of walking out of the terminal. Reception recognise weary travellers and we checked in with ease (you can do this on the app as well). 

The room was lovely, made up for a family, comfortable and spotless. In the morning, showered and refreshed we were greeted with friendly good mornings by the cleaning staff as we walked down for the excellent buffet breakfast. So much good quality choice and something for everyone.

We’d parked at the silver parking so the short walk to the terminal to catch the bus back then a quick drive back to the hotel to collect the family was quick and easy. Hotel gives you free parking for a few hrs to do this. Just validate your ticket at reception.

Overall, great option for an early or late flight. Great staff, lovely rooms and fab breakfast. We’d certainly stay again.

Hotel was very clean and the rooms excellent the airport is approx 3-4 minute walk to the Departure lounge.
We ate at the hotel and the food was excellent , whilst the choice wasn’t great the good quality was very good as well as the breakfast. Breakfast is continental style from 4am which we made use of as we had an early flight , English breakfast from 6. The beds where very comfortable and we will use this hotel again when we travel to Bristol Airport.

Not only is it within walking distance of the airport (literally across the road) but it is also within driving distance of Bath and Castle Coombe, both of which we were able to visit within a day.

The hotel was immaculate.  Our room had two beds, a TV, a bathroom.  The bathroom had a sliding door entry, a toilet with buttons for flushing, and a stall shower. The shower door did not fully enclose the space, which was unusual but not terribly inconvenient. Just be aware that some water might leak out onto the floor.  The sliding entry door has an opaque piece of glass or plastic, but we noticed that shadows of someone in the bathroom can occasionally be seen from the outside of the bathroom.

We enjoyed having breakfast in the hotel's rather expansive and nice seating area.  There is a rather wide selection of hot and cold breakfast items to choose from in the buffet room with something for everyone in the family. You can also order lunch/dinner food later in the day near the front desk, where various snack items are also available to satisfy a sweet tooth.

Another great tip is that we were able to return our rental car to an Enterprise very nearby.

All in all, a very nice place to complete our trip to England. We were able to pack up and walk across the street to Bristol Airport and start our trip home.  We'll definitely remember this hotel is here for when we visit England again!","2","","2019-04-30","2019-08-21","2019-08-21","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r701630777-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We got to the hotel at 02:00 only to find the hotel had no record of our booking despite us having a confirmation email, reference number and a holding deposit on my card. I was offered a hotel in the city centre with a taxi to and from the hotel. After  30 minutes of explaining we were collecting a car first thing from the airport and then we had a long drive they managed to find a suitable room.

That was not a good start but pretty much the worst of it. The hotel was very clean I cannot fault that at all.

The beds were OK, but there were 2 other problems. The TV didn't work, there was no signal at all and that something I can never forgive being an Englishman. The breakfast area had a large dispenser of HP Sauce BUT it was not HP Sauce.. more like cheap cash and carry sauce!! How could they do that to someone!!. The breakfast was fine and there was plenty to eat. 

I would stay there again if needed but I think I would look elsewhere first.","1","","2019-08-31","2019-08-21","2019-08-21","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r701434202-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

There is clear sign inside the airport but there is no covered walkway to the hotel, and while there are step-free access, there will be steps involved.  Baggage trolley is necessary if you carry heavy suitcase.  Since it is a new Hampton, the design reflects the updated decor.  The room is on the small side so a large family has to book a larger family suite or two rooms.  However for a solo traveler, it is decent, and there is even more closet room than Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminal Two.  There is a mini fridge and a kettle inside the room, but there is no microwave.  The WIFI is easily accessible and is definitely high speed.  As a diamond member, I was offered a choice of snacks and a bottle of still or sparkling water.  

My only issue is the restaurant, in which the selections are on the weak side.  I think there are rooms for improvement.  I ended buying food from the M&S Simply Food at the arrival level.  

I have no issue staying here again if I have an early or late flight in and out of Bristol Airport!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/18/c9/b4/b4/hampton-by-hilton-bristol.jpg

The lobby is large and well decorated. There is a bar and a restaurant serving meals all day long. The same restaurant serves the Hampton breakfast but it includes a full buffet and is very well done.

The room itself was clean and the bathroom was gorgeous with a very large walk in shower. The main was very comfortable but the sofa bed was impossible to sleep in and was like sleeping on a floor. I had to swap with my child so she could get some sleep but by 7am I’d had enough and needed a bit of kip so the three of crammed into the main double bed. Breakfast was lovely but the chef was very rude and miserable and couldn’t wait to shut it all up, I ended up sitting eating my food without a drink as by time I sat down the doors were closed. Check out again no assistance offered with luggage. The receptionist and manager was very polite and did give a discount when I told her of my issues.

The food was awful even then  but the rooms were great and the location, obviously, a boon. Just stayed again, the food is still awful and it’s such a shame it’s been allowed to become grubby. The tables in the restaurant are sticky and not clean. I didn’t see a clean floor in the whole place. Does nobody hoover around the edges - anywhere? There was food under chairs and tables, even in the lounge bit by the exit door. 
In our room - there were toe nails on the bathroom floor and hair in the shower. The carpet was hoovered badly and, again, obviously, had not been cleaned around the edges. The bedding was clean. Had it not been 4am, and we were only staying for a few hours sleep before we drove home after a late flight, I would have phoned down to reception and would have expected them to do something about it. 
I’m not sure whether we will stay here again. ","2","","2019-07-31","2019-07-11","2019-07-11","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r688763351-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

My wife had the pasta dish which was just about edible.  The pie I had was terrible, the presentation was shocking.  The pie was on top of a watery mashed potato and covered with mushy peas and the whole pile of food was covered in a thick almost black sauce which was conjeling quickly as it cooled.  When this was all scraped off the pie for a bought in pie it was not to bad.I did complain to the waitress but nobody came to see me despite me waiting 10 minutes. Whoever designed this presentation should never be allowed near a kitchen again.  I would stay here again but I will make other arrangements for eating.

However, when we arrived at the hotel, we were told that ""due to maintenance"" they had no room for us in the hotel. We asked why they had not e-mailed us to tell us before we arrived, but they had no answer to that. Instead they relocated us to another hotel after much discussion (Premiere Inn) in Weston, half an hours drive away! We did not arrive there for another hour and a half, and when we did finally get there (at 3am) Premiere In at first tried to charge us again. We were exhausted and yet had to wait while Premiere Inn phoned Hampton by Hilton to sort it all out.

If you don’t like dealing with the public, it’s probably the wrong job. 

The hotel was very busy and the staff were stretched. Bar staff were much friendlier but they also struggled.

Unfortunately the tables in the restaurant had recently been painted so we ended up with black marks on our arms (which wouldn’t come off for two days). When we mentioned it to staff they weren’t bothered. If I’d been in an expensive suit I would have been very upset.

The room was ok but not what I had booked, I’m convinced it was the hotel’s fault. 

They also put us in an accessible room. The emergency switch is right next to the light switch so be careful if you get up in the night!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/18/13/ff/39/photo0jpg.jpg

My biggest gripe with this hotel is the access! I was travelling alone,there are numerous flights of steps down to the hotel which is hard enough if you have a large or heavy suitcase,going back up would be impossible. No covered walkway, no concierge or trolley access to make this easier. 
The only option to get back to the airport if you have bags that you cannot carry up 2 flights of stairs is to walk to the long stay car park bus stop and wait for the bus that takes 8mins!! When the airport is 500m away max. Its crazy, they really need to address this with taking out the stairs and building ramps preferably that are covered.

Very nice breakfast which you can take away if you are in a hurry.Cooked option from 6am. 
Full marks for all that.A bit expensive at £110 but very convenient with a nice breakfast.
However- dinner is grim .I chose the curry which was ok.My husband chose the award winning pie.Smothered in glutinous gravy which looked like a thick chocolate sauce.The atmosphere was soulless like eating in a hospital when bad news is expected.It was cold and draughty with wide open spaces.Others eating all looked miserable.The pizza looked ok.The lighting was very dark and gloomy.Altogether I could not wait to return to the room.Perhaps they should just serve an all day breakfast and re think their food offer.","1","","2019-06-30","2019-06-18","2019-06-18","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r682423813-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

  Check-in was effortless, and a pleasant experience. The room was ideal for our nights stay, clean, spacious, comfortable bed, a good shower with adequate toiletries and exceptionally quiet for an airport.
  Our only criticisms are focused on the dining area. Queuing to order food and drink is good as it avoids the usual arguments at the bar, however, not so good is the dining experience. We were hoping for a relaxing restaurant but it feels more like a fast food outlet. Food quality is average, limited on selection and poor on healthy food options. The beer choice is Boddingtons draught so I opted for a Guinness and my wife a large red wine, £16.50 was a shock, sorry a disgrace!
  This is a good hotel and perfect for the start of your holiday, improve the dining options and reduce your bar prices and you have a winner.","2","","2019-06-30","2019-06-15","2019-06-15","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r681611347-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

All airport hotels you pay over the odds for the cost of the room, food, drinks (and if it’s Heathrow the taxi to the terminal). So it’s refreshing to discover that this hotel advertises a product and it’s pretty much what you get.
It’s located a short walk from the airport terminal. The rooms are modern and comfortable and remarkably quiet despite being so close to aircraft. I’m not sure if all rooms are the same but ours had no bath but perfectly good walk in shower. The room cost £99.
There isn’t a restaurant but the lobby serves as one with plenty tables and chairs and you can order bar food from the bar. We both had the duck oriental spring rolls to start (both large portions) then a tomato pasta with added chicken and flat bread, and, chicken Caesar salad. The mains were also substantial. With a bottle of wine the food bill came to £50 which, when you consider the last time we stayed at an airport hotel it was the Sofitel Gatwick where the meal cost almost £100, I thought it was good value.
It’s not The Ritz but it’s not pretending to be.

So we had a larger each and a pizza ,The pizza was lovely but to this day I am convinced it was a Chicago town pizza out of a box !!

The staff Are helpful and Friendly, the rooms clean, with plenty of extras, toiletries, coffee , tea etc, hairdryer, iron and board are useful too. We thought we would have a light snack in the early evening so opted for the soup of the day, which was Stilton and broccoli, served with crusty bread, the menu Is limited but ok  but the soup was tasteless and for some reason totally filled with croutons as well as the crusty bread provided and , presumably left standing from the microwave as the croutons had completely soaked all the soup up so it was a solid mass.....don’t think I would eat there again, however this aside, a very clean convenient place to stay before an early or late flight.

I live in Jersey, therefore I have no internet here and was unable to get in contact with my family from Jersey and Krakow.

I have let the 2 lovely blond receptionists at the hotel know of my difficult situation and they were very welcoming and have let me sit in the main lounge, use their WiFi, let me leave my luggage in the luggage room so I don’t have to walk around with it. I’ve managed to get in contact with my family in both Jersey and Krakow and we’re sorting it all out so that I can hopefully fly out soon. My friend who lives in Bristol finishes work at 6pm and they’ll only be able to pick me up then. 

The staff have been so kind to me, allowing me to stay here since 8am in the morning to sort everything out and I could not thank them enough for their kindness.

Whenever I’m next in Bristol I’m sure to come back and spend a night here. I 100% recommend this hotel, I have stayed in many hotels in the past and no one was quite as kind and welcoming as the 2 lovely receptionists here.","1","","2019-05-31","2019-05-23","2019-05-23","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r675869600-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Two bits of advice however:

The hotel website did tell me that there were no rooms available when I tried to make a reservation and wanted a car parking space. There does not appear to be a link between the hotel and the vast car parks that surround the airport. Book the room separately with Hilton's website and book the parking spot on Bristol Airport's website.

We were too early in the morning for a cooked breakfast so had to settle for continental - therefore I cannot comment on that aspect - however the food on the evening was not really up to standard. I am always suspicious when plates arrive 5 minutes after ordering and my wife's burger was not a good grade or that hot. It was edible but not that great. Perhaps another aspect of this hotel that will be sorted in time?

In summary, this hotel does exactly what you want it for and at a price point comparable to the other chains. Our next holiday has an early flight so already booked in again!","0","","2019-04-30","2019-04-24","2019-04-24","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r668903811-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Restaurant choice very poor, and limited. Staff not very helpful when serving food either. If we’d of known before we would of eaten before arriving at the hotel.  There was a new member of staff behind reception/bar looked like she had been pulled through a hedge backwards and really didn’t want to be there.

This hotel is new and well done.  Truly, only yards (err, meters) from the Bristol airport terminal.  It had a very spacious car park, as well.
The hotel is up to the usual Hampton standards with the adder of a Euro-common bar and restaurant.  We had a good dinner.  The early breakfast was true continental style; we left too early for the ""full English breakfast"" that came later.
I would certainly recommend this hotel if you are in/out of the Bristol airport or traveling in Cornwall.","0","","2019-04-30","2019-04-20","2019-04-20","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r667899005-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The fact it was served COLD had us returning all three dishes for a refund of which I got.. 

I was Informed the food is actually shipped in and microwaved. They don't have a kitchen or chef on site.. So your basically getting airplane food served with your pint.

I'd love a Gordon Ramsey visit. Incredible the Hilton hotel can't operate a working kitchen and serve fresh cooked food.

So watch out as you buying pre-cooked processed pre packed rubbish.

We had an early flight so decided to stay here the night before and parked our car in the long stay car park again not too far from the hotel. 
We were greeted very quickly and warmly by the receptionist and check in was very quick. 
Our room was clean and very spacious, even though we wouldn’t be staying for long, sometimes hotel rooms can feel very cramped but it didn’t feel like this at all. 
We went downstairs for tea and was surprised how reasonably priced the food was especially for a hotel bar. The menu was good too with lots to choose from. The food came out really quick and was lovely, I had the curry which was amazing and my husband had a pizza which looked so good too. 
Had a great sleep in very comfortable beds, check out was also very easy. Breakfast starts from 4am which is really handy for those flying early. It’s not a cooked breakfast, until 5/6am, but the selection of yogurts, cereal, waffles, pastries was really good, plus you could take things away if you didn’t have time to sit and eat breakfast. 
All the little touches have been thought of for this hotel and we really couldn’t fault it.
Would definitely recommend it to anyone staying before a flight and we will definitely be staying again if we have another early flight.

Better yet, it’s a two minute walk from the airport entrance via a couple of sets of steps or ramps. 

The windows are quadruple glazed, so despite being right next to the airport you’d have to have supersonic hearing to be disturbed by the activity outside.

It also has free WiFi for guests and the speed is very good in rooms and reception – perfect for allowing you to check any changes to your flight. Although you can also do this using the departure boards in the lobby area.

We booked a family room for four, which came with a double bed and sofa bed which was made up when we arrived. There was a good-sized desk and chair, TV with freeview, kettle with mugs, tea and coffee, a hairdryer, luggage stand, safe, ironing board and iron, and an alarm clock. You can get a wake up call if you want. There was even a wardrobe with lots of hanging space…I doubt that gets used often! 

In the bathroom we had a walk-in shower with toiletry dispensers.

In reception there’s a large open plan, airy seating area with a bar where you can order hot meals. We’d eaten at a service station on the way, but the smells coming from the tables made me wish we’d been able to hold on. 

Breakfast was timed to start at 4pm, so we could sit down and have continental breakfast before our 4.30am check in. So handy! 

We were really impressed with the hotel and have already booked again for our next early flight from Bristol in July.","25","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/2a/33/cb/photo0jpg.jpg

Bar and food caters to a captive airport hotel crowd,but does the job,and at least this means you can get food/drinks.
Breakfast really good,lots of choice,even when busy,well staffed and replenished.

Overall this is a very good hotel,for the location, specially when flying,I would not hesitate to return,a enjoyable stay.","2","","2019-03-31","2019-03-22","2019-03-22","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r660311285-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Took advantage of the room selection & digital key via the app which is very convenient.  Parked at the hotel to offload luggage - 1 hr free if you get your ticket validated at reception & then moved the car to the long stay we had pre-booked.

Room was great - clean, crisp & quiet.  Everything you need.  TV a little frustrating to operate & locate channels but no other room issues.

Had a couple of drinks & some nachos in the bar before getting some nibbles etc from M&S in the airport.  Everything reasonably priced for a captive audience.

Bed very comfortable & unusually for me, even managed a few hours sleep before an early alarm.  Water in the shower took a while to warm up but it was 4.30 am.

Free continental breakfast was fine given it’s difficult to eat at that time of day but the coffee was appreciated.

Our 2nd stay & will definitely book again if ever travelling from BRS.","0","","2019-03-31","2019-03-21","2019-03-21","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r660210602-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

1 The greeting from the receptionist was so warm and friendly. Immediately, we were made to feel like welcome guests.
2  The room is so comfortable with everything you could need for an overnight stay. The bathroom/shower is excellent and for once we stayed in a hotel where the bathroom extractor fan actually works!!
3  All the staff appear to be well trained and nothing is too much trouble.

So glad we chose this hotel. It was very clean, had a comfortable bed, no noise from the airport and was in the perfect location. 
We parked in the Long Stay carpark as we thought that the parking charges at the hotel were extortionate. Free bus to and from the carpark to the airport then a 3 min walk to the hotel. 
There were 2 couples in our party and we decided to have an evening meal in the hotel. We were given an electronic disc when we ordered our food which appears to have been a total waste of time...either it doesn’t work properly or the staff haven’t been trained in its use. We ordered 4 pies with chips rather than mash...after about 15 mins a waitress appeared to deliver 2 pies with mash...we told her we’d ordered them with chips...she went away then came back looking puzzled then wandered off again...10 mins later 2 pies with chips arrived with no gravy and it looked liked the peas had been scrapped off the top of the pie...we didn’t think it was ours but it was plonked down. 20 mins later a waiter appeared with 3 pies, with chips, gravy & peas and looked very confused to see that 2 of us had already eaten most of the meal...he tried to deliver 3 pies and we told him we only wanted 2...clearly our orders had been confused and the restaurant wasn’t overly busy!
Despite the farsical delivery of our food, it was nice.
We would definitely stay at this hotel again if we fly from Bristol.","0","","2019-03-31","2019-03-10","2019-03-10","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r657497873-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We had curry washed down with 3 bottles of prosecco! We parked at the hotel while we were away, it wasn't much different in price to other airport car parks for just 3 days as the hotel validates your ticket to get a reduced rate. It was certainly much easier parking there and having the short walk to and from the terminal, I even managed it with my mobility issues. The bed was really comfy, my only criticism of the room is one side of the bed is only about 6 inches away from the wall, there is plenty of room apart from that, just poorly designed. I would certainly stay here again. I checked in using the app. I also downloaded my room key too, so actually didn't need to go to reception at all!

It is brilliant that Bristol Airport now has a city style hotel in the airport site.  Holiday Inn is a few mile away and Premier Inn is at Sidcot even further.

Parking on site is £15.95 a day, but you can unload the car free of charge as the parking barrier charges don’t indicate this.  Please just take the ticket and get it validated at reception.  We off loaded then drove our car to long stay then walked back to the hotel.

The rooms are quite basic and not too big, there is a walk in shower but no bath.  Tea and coffee provided but never enough perhaps one cup each provided but you can ask for more.

Restaurant ok nothing luxurious, menu could be improved but it’s the Hampton group and not just Bristol. Fish and chips or steaks not on the menu.  Drinks normal hotel prices.

 Breakfast hot and cold but only scrambled eggs not fried or poached.  Otherwise very acceptable as complimentary.

There is a partial covered walkway to the airport terminal and using the ramps takes about 5 minutes.

I would use this hotel again for its convenience, but it is expensive especially without parking.

Best Bits

Amazingly comfortable beds (altho may be too firm for some)

Lovely hot shower with shower gel, shampoo and conditioner attached to the wall) also hand wash and body lotion supplied 

Very quiet room excellent sound proofing - we stayed at the end of a corridor room 374 so nobody walking past us all night and standing outside having conversations !

Very friendly staff - everyone we spoke to seemed happy and professional

Good breakfast - reasonable choice of hot and cold food and it was free !

Not so good bits

Very very busy on Saturday evening , tried to order some food and was told about an hour wait at 7.30pm this may not have bothered some and I know it was half term but not not too good, so good job M & S were at the terminal for a snack

Would be good to have a quiet area in a few corners at it does have a bit of a canteen feel  about the food area.

Each room has tea, coffee and a kettle. They advertised that there was free in room movies via the television but I could not find them. The bathroom had basic toiletries and the hotel has excellent free wifi throughout. Breakfast was included in the price and starts at 4am with continental for those who have an early flight. From 6.30 they offer full English with excellent options including a waffle maker, four types of porridge, various cereals, fruit, cold meats, yogurts etc. One disappointment was that they don't offer fried eggs.

Our evening meal was ok, not much choice but adequate. The bar restaurant area was big and noisy. Aesthetically  unpleasing from a design point of view and felt instantly uncomfortable as we walked in. Seating and dining was uncomfortable, no low lighting for relaxing dining and it felt just like an airport waiting area. I would stay again if we had another early start as its so convenient.  Shame about the dining/ bar area being so bland, open and unwelcoming, just badly designed.","0","","2019-02-28","2019-02-12","2019-02-12","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r651945643-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is new, and is just across from the airport.

Our room was lovely, very quiet & well decorated.  A lot of thought has gone into this hotel & breakfast is available from 04.00, very handy for early flights.

As you would expect in an airport hotel, drinks etc are quite expensive, and unless you add the drinks to your room you do not get the benefit of the HHonors points.  Apart from that, the staff are wonderful and the hotel itself is very nice.","2","","2019-01-31","2019-02-12","2019-02-12","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r651752903-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We left our car at the airport's Silverzone parking the night before and caught their courtesy bus to the terminal from which it is a 1-2 minute walk along a walkway to the hotel.

Friendly and efficient staff on reception who gave us all the relevant information about eating options and times etc.

Room was well appointed, clean and warm without being overheated as in many establishments. Bed was very comfortable and bathroom facilities good.

Public areas bright and clean

Menu not extensive but a good variety of options at a fair price and some items available 24 hours. Portions were very generous and attractively served.

Continental breakfast is available from 4 am and included in the room rate so was ideal for us with our early check in and something we have not been able to avail ourselves of at other airport hotels in the vicinity. There was a good choice of fruit juices, cereals, porridge, yoghurts, fruit, toast, bread, croissants, muffins, spreads, ham and cheese, a variety of tea and coffee.

A quick  return 1-2 minute walk and we were back at the terminal for our check in without having had to be up hours beforehand. This hotel would also be perfect for a late arrival by air for a good night's sleep before an onward journey.

Good value for the convenience, level of facilities and service provided, we will definitely be returning in the future and will now be our hotel of choice when flying from Bristol","0","","2019-01-31","2019-02-11","2019-02-11","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r651576101-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

This one met our requirement. We carried our luggage from the airport to this hotel. Luckily it wasn't far.  We booked two rooms way ahead of time and had requested them to be near each other. It turned out that the rooms were in the opposite ends of the building. I asked if they could give us the rooms that were closer but the manager on duty didn't seem to bother. It wasn't a busy night, I could tell that there were quite a few empty rooms. Other staff were quite helpful. 

The rooms were clean, complimentary breakfast was good but service was questionable. That was my impression.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/16/5d/fc/42/complimentary-breakfast.jpg

Parking is very expensive and there is no possibility to get a multiday pass to use several times. Each time you leave, you have to validate a ticket. Discount is very low.

It was easy to book and is so close to the airport it was only a couple of minutes walk and we were in the airport.  We only had the option of an accessible room as all other rooms were booked.  Because of this the bathroom was more of a wet room, the problem with this was although there was a shower curtain the water ran across the bathroom floor and there was no way of mopping it up.   Also the toilet was incredibly high that neither of us could touch the floor when sat on it, and we are not particularly short!  Other than this the room was clean and spacious and staff were happy to assist us when we requested more tea and coffee etc for our room.  There is a modest menu for evening meals and food was served swiftly.  Overall this made the early morning flight so much more bearable and we would definitely stay here again although not in an accessible room next time.","1","","2019-01-31","2019-02-04","2019-02-04","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r650115500-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

There was a problem at check in so when we arrived people were standing around waiting.  It would have been better if someone had explained that there was a problem with the computer system but as it was we were just left standing around and not knowing what was happening,  When we got to the front of the queue the lady was very apologetic and helpful. We had wanted a drink from the bar and she offered to get the drinks while we took our bags upstairs and then we could come back down and fetch them which was good of her.  The rooms are clean and comfortable and the breakfast is good.  Only problem was they closed breakfast without warning us so we only got half way through breakfast.  Would have been better if someone had said they were going to close so we could quickly fetch what we needed instead we never got to finish breakfast. Location is excellent - right next to departures/arrivals.  Not cheap but I suppose you are paying for the location.","2","","2019-01-31","2019-01-29","2019-01-29","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r649029159-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Reception area: like a student common room. Room: had to change rooms as the extractor fan in the bathroom was very noisy only to find the next room was the same. (Tip: wind the centre right down to close it off or you won't sleep). Heating took ages to come on and when it did, it only heated the top half of the room. The uncarpetted floor sections, including the bathroom are FREEZING so take slippers. Design of the room is poor so that only one side of the bed has a cabinet. Fittings in tbe room have a very cheap and low quality appearance. The tv system is very slow and cumbersome to the point we thought the remote control wasn't working. Plusses: good bedside light and there's a plug socket on each side of the bed which is rare. The bed was adequately comfortable.  Also, the room was clean. Would I stay there again? Hmmm, only if my flight was so early I'd really absolutely no choice.","0","","2019-01-31","2019-01-08","2019-01-07","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r644459179-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We had chosen a room with 2 single beds and a sofa bed on the first floor and were given a room with a double bed and a sofa bed on the 3rd floor!!. 
The man who checked us in asked if we wanted the sofa bed making up which was a very strange question since there were 3 of us and we had specifically booked a sofa bed, perhaps he was expecting the third person to sleep in the wardrobe.

Despite the air conditioning in the room being switched off it made screeching, clunking and clicking noises every 30 minutes or so all night and kept us awake, when I mentioned this to the man at the checkout desk in the morning he simply said 'yes, we are aware there is a problem with the air con units on the third floor' and that was it, no apology or reduction in charge or anything. SO 3 very tired and cranky travellers left for an early flight having had virtually no sleep, and let's face it, that's the only reason anyone uses this hotel by the airport.
Awful service, if you know there is an issue that is going to keep people awake then DON'T ALLOCATE THE ROOMS !!!!","0","","2018-12-31","2019-01-03","2019-01-03","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r643302642-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Really convenient for early flight.","Stayed here overnight for an early flight the next morning to Madeira.  Parked in long stay car park and walked to Hotel.  Staff were so friendly, helpful and welcoming at reception and we were quickly booked in.  Lovely room which turned out to be very quiet and we had a good sleep.  Arranged early morning call with reception and this duly happened at agreed time.  Lovely fluffy white towels in bathroom and flannels were also provided together with quality shower gel, shampoo etc.  Went down for continental breakfast at 4am and the choice was very good. Yoghurts, Porridge, cereals, ham & cheese and lovely fresh croissants and Danish pastries. Fresh orange juice too   Check out was quick and again friendly staff on reception.  Our only slight niggle was that there was not much choice for an evening meal the night before.  Would have liked to have had lasagne or chilli con carne on the menu rather than just a curry or beef burgers but we settled for a light snack of duck spring rolls, chips and salad which was quite tasty in any event.
Beautiful, modern and clean hotel with lovely staff and we would definitely like to stay there again.","0","","2018-11-30","2018-12-09","2018-12-09","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r638393377-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

I telephoned prior to our stay - the receptionist was extremely helpful explaining how we could drive up to the front of the hotel and unload with no parking fee (for up to 1 hour)  .  This was superb. The next morning we were too early for the cooked breakfast but were delighted with the continental breakfast on offer,  an excellent start to the day (far better than anything in the airport).  We collected our airport trolley ( cost £2)  and wheeled it up to our room.  Once out of the Hotel the pathway is partly covered, having the extra weight we followed the zig zag path which led us to the airport entrance and the check in desks.  This whole process was very easy and not too arduous with all the weight.   Staff at reception were superb, and the breakfast excellent.  Have already booked prior to our next flight. We also noticed that the Hotel backs onto the onsite long-stay parking, so will use that next time.   Staying at this Hotel takes the stress out of travelling by air.

When we arrived no Prosecco had been put in, so he asked about it and they said “oh yes we can see a drinks voucher has been applied to your account, well send the Prosecco up now”. No Prosecco arrived. It got to 11pm and we gave up and went to sleep! 

The room itself had been set up for two separate travellers not a couple. They had pulled out and made the sofa bed to make a second double bed, leaving no room to move about in the room. 

The hotel itself was clean and modern as you’d expect being brand new almost. The bar was set out nicely. But wouldn’t order food again as it was almost empty when we arrived and it took 50 minutes for our nachos to arrive.

The dinner was simple fare, but perfectly acceptable, and the bar area had USB charging for phones and tablets. The breakfast was small and simple with 6 hot items plus 2 cold trays for meat and cheese, however unfortunately the hotel could not cater for the number of guests and most food trays - bacon, eggs, cheese, sausages, beans - were empty. The guests waiting were told more would come, but that the kitchen was only set up to make one item at a time so they would have to be patient. Quality of food when it did arrive was relatively poor. Parking for hotel guests was charged as a £16.50 per night extra. Overall, it is a reasonable hotel if you have modest expectations. Location and staff are definitely the strong points here.

However the room was appalling, for just one reason: the noise of the air conditioning. Every couple of hours it would let out a 1-2 second blast of noise, sometimes followed by a couple of minutes of rattling. The only reason to stay at this hotel was to get an extra hour of sleep before a 4am check in. I was awakened at midnight and again just after 2am. Defeated the purpose of staying here. Complaining and changing rooms at midnight would have been even more disruptive and robbed me of even more sleep. This problem is mentioned in several reviews, going back months.

I made online  reservation several weeks before. This reservation had an error as it was for the Hampton hotel but for Bristol City.
The hotel receptionist was very ""friendly"" and she telephoned the Hotel Bristol City Center and canceled our reservation. Then she used my credit card and charged my account for the room at the Hampton Bristol Airport hotel, which was where we spent the night. 
They answered:  have spoken to the team on duty on the evening of the 18th and no one recalls receiving a call from the Hampton Bristol Airport I’m afraid.
 
As the booking was made through a third party, we would have been unable to cancel the booking without the authorisation of the third party.
 
I apologise if you were given the wrong information when you called, but without talking to Booking.com and cancelling the reservation through them we would not be able to waive the no-show charges.
I do not understand why that call does not appear in the hotel reception.
So, were we cheated by that employee?
If so, as you say, I'm going to write a critique in trip-advisor, showing my disagreement.

Luego usó mi tarjeta de crédito y cobró a mi cuenta la habitación en el hotel Hampton Bristol Airport, que fue donde pasamos la noche.
Hice una reclamación cuando vi que me habían cobrado la noche en los 2 hoteles y ellos me contestaron que habían hablado con el equipo de servicio la tarde del 18 y nadie recuerda haber recibido una llamada del aeropuerto Hampton Bristol.
 
No entiendo por qué esa llamada no aparece en la recepción del hotel.
Entonces, ¿fuimos engañados por esa empleada de recepción?

The single beds were wide, the room was clean however it lacked an easy chair to sit in.  The room was relatively quiet.
The Continental Breakfast offered a variety of choices.
I was very disappointed with the very limited choice that the complimentary tray presented; 5 Nescafe sachets, 5 Twining’s Breakfast tea sachets, sweeteners, sugar and a few small milks. No choice of teas, no hot chocolate, nothing else.  Maybe I could have gone down to reception, asked for different teas & been given some but after a journey delayed by an accident on the motorway all I wanted was to be able to get a drink in the room without any fuss.  Fortunately I had brought some of my own tea bags with me.  The choice was as limited as I have found anywhere and in view of the cost of the room I am marking the hotel down for it.  
Reception told me that the parking they offer at £16.50 a night on their website is only for the night you stay at the hotel, any other night is much more expensive.  That car park is the closest to the hotel and when I stayed was almost empty.  Premier car park was almost full and it seems a shame to have such underused facilities that close to the hotel.","0","","2018-11-30","2018-11-07","2018-11-07","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r631643116-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

I would definitely stay here again.","0","","2018-10-31","2018-11-07","2018-11-06","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r631524897-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

It is a clean and nice looking hotel and we liked the bar and restaurant area. To cater more for families with small children it would have been grwat witha small little playroom or such but unfortunately there isn’t any of that. 

Thought the food was fine and sufficient choice for both adults and kids. Did not get to try the hot buffet breakfast but only continental as our flight was too early. But we were happy with what was on offer.

The biggest reason to why our rating comes down was the extremely uncomfortablr fold out sofabed. We were two adults and two children and we slept one parent and one baby in that rock hard bed and it was horrendous. I really think the hotel should invest in better pullout beds or at least put on an extra mattress or something. The main double bed was fine and comfy though so if there are obly two of you will prob have a nice stay. But that extrabed was so hard that we would definately think twice about staying in this hotel again as a family at least.

Another slight minus is the website which is rubbish.

Other that that, good hotel and friendly staff (they were very forthcoming and helpful when our little three-year-old locked herself in the bathroom and then was unable to unlock it again....)","0","","2018-11-30","2018-11-06","2018-11-06","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r631415370-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Staff were amazing, having had an extremely long day at work, they accommodated my need for a quiet room on the ground level. Room was extremely clean and beds are very comfortable. Amazing nights sleep. Food smelt amazing, but did not have time in the morning, however with the amount of people sitting down for breakfast, I would safely say food must be good. Would recommend this hotel to anyone, especially for early morning flights and will say due to proximity to the airport, it is not one bit noisy.","0","","2018-10-31","2018-11-06","2018-11-06","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r631271834-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

I have not got much to add except it’s really only good for one thing.  Slap bang opposite departures!

I wonder, how can it possibly get such a wide range of reviews from “terrible” to “outstanding”?? Can these be reviews of the same place?

Must just be a bit of a lottery? Depending on which staff are on? Which room you are lucky or unlucky enough to get? (Clearly avoid room 142!  Or room 8!) ....or on How busy it is?   

Reading between the lines this place was chucked up to make money.  Hence the countless complaints about noisy air con and defective plumbing.  And it’s pretty clear that there are not enough staff, and those that there are are probably underpaid, undervalued, demoralised at all the problems that they are powerless to fix, and have a horrible time trying to cope. No wonder they might be rude sometimes. Or, at best, just don’t seem to care.

I stayed here in March. To save getting up at 2am and driving up for the dreaded early flight. Just like very many of the reviewers. So I am already saving a poor night’s sleep and potentially awful night-time drive. Staff were so-so.  Not bad. Not great either.  Room was a clean bare box. Can’t recall if it was noisy or not.  

Did not use the aircon. Saved the shower for my proper4* Spanish hotel.  Spain knows how to do hotel accommodation.  We don’t. 

Ate my own sandwiches and snacks. These were clearly all wise choices.  Grabbed a coffee and croissant at 4.30am.  Both were ok. 

Saved myself for the decent food I knew I’d get at any one of the inexpensive Spanish cafe bars next day. For a fraction of our rip-off prices.  Knew too that I could get get great Costa coffee and toast quite cheaply in the airport. Just before boarding. Perfect. 

If, despite the really bad reviews you decide to “go for it” at this funny hotel, do so just because it really is very nice to just trot over to departures in a couple of minutes. And that’s all! 

And, I recommend that you:-

1. Don’t eat an evening meal here.
2. Pay APH parking in advance.
3. Bring earplugs, 
      & don’t bother to shower...
4. Be prepared for a slow check in.
5. Don’t expect pleasant staff, then you can only be pleasantly surprised.
6. Just stay for the location - nothing else.  
7. Be philosophical. Expect middling to bad. Expect soulless. It’s UK!  Everything about England is substandard and a rip-off, right? 
8. And don’t forget those earplugs!

Then you might say - “hey, it’s basic, it’s a classic UK rip-off, but it served its purpose”. 

Expect poor quality if you stay in accommodation in England..  especially at any airport hotels. I’ve stayed at two others near Bristol.  Both were dire!

They are all just factories for us susceptible 2nd class citizens who happen to be air travellers. 

If we could afford better we’d not be catching flights at silly-o-Clock... or we’d get picked up and dropped off at the airport by taxi, right? 

Expect substandard.  That way you can only be pleasantly surprised if anything is better than average..  or even, dare I say it, nice?

Check in was seamless, very efficient. The room was lovely. Very quiet and comfortable bed, but could have done with firmer pillows. The resturant/bar was nice and spacious you didn't feel like you were sitting in the lap of the table next to you. Drinks aren't cheap but what else do you expect as they have a captive market (but they were by no means over priced). The food was good, great portion sizes there was no feeling of being short changed and it came out piping hot. The only gripe I had was that the floor and table were grubby. 
WiFi is fast and easy to connect to. 
All the staff we had contact with we're friending and efficient. 
If we visit again we will look into getting an extra night in the airport parking as having to pay 16.50 for just a few hours we though was a bit much, but hey ho we should have expected it to be a bit like that.

Reception staff were delightful and helpful and we even got a drink to calm our nerves at 12.30 after a landing in horrendous conditions ! The rooms are perfectly suitable for an overnight stay with good shower and tea/coffee making facility. Beds were excellent.
Breakfasts both full and early continental were above average and perhaps the only criticism, as mentioned in several reviews, is the very minimalistic retaurant menu.","1","","2018-10-31","2018-11-01","2018-11-01","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r630045501-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

I was absolutely starving and as the menu is very limited I bought I would choose the burger again despite having a really bad one previously, surely it couldn’t be as bad.  Oh yes it could.  Despite requesting it be cooked medium rare I was told that was impossible. Why!  It arrived and was like shoe leather. Awful. Dry and tasteless.  However, the chips and salad were delicious but a lot of money to pay for chips and salad.  I would however mention a member of staff, Rebecca, with who. I discussed my concerns.  She was extremely helpful and said she would speak to the GM about this in the morning. 

Why oh why cannot you offer a decent menu with well cooked food.  The Holiday Inn down the road manage to do so so why can’t the Hilton.  

Such a shame as everything else is good.","1","","2018-10-31","2018-10-24","2018-10-24","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r627654850-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Pleasant staff at check in.

You don't need a large room and ours was fine but the layout was not! To quote another reviewer (because I cannot improve on it): ""why on earth would you have a bed that was about a foot off a wall on one side so it’s hard to move between them and get in and out of it and on the other side a massive space that has a corner couch, a desk. chair etc. The corner shelf on the side of the bed against the wall holds a cube clock and a glass if you’re lucky, too small and impractical!!"" 

Our main issues were the bed and the air con. We like a firm mattress but this one (presumably quite new) was rock hard. The air con was noisy but, as usual, the windows don't open so no choice but to use it.  For both these issues, if we had been staying more than one night, we would have asked to move rooms.

The bathroom was fine, being nice and clean but, also to echo a previous reviewer,  why is the toilet roll holder so low to the floor? It needs to be about a foot higher up the wall. As it was ours wasn't 100% level so there were many scenes from an Andrex advert!

We found the evening food in the bar area and the  breakfast all very adequate for the occasion.

All in all the hotel is well located and generally well laid out, but sadly I can't honestly say we would stay again and therefore cannot recommend it.

Breakfast was in the price, basic but busy if you choose to go later than 8-9 am but they do advise this. If your fussy then don’t bother with breakfast but if not then there’s plenty of it but quality basic.
Parking in the NCP st. James next door was expensive,18 hours with 20% off was £18.50 so you will need to factor that in.

On arrival which was s shame because first impressions were good... but the room wasn’t up to standard
Key was given in half a cut up envelope which wasn’t impressive
Rooms are basic and uncomfortable 
The air con is very loud and in general there are multiple noises going on from neighbours and plumbing and sporadic gremlins creeping through the air on
It isn’t restful to say the least
The bathroom shower had a rod stabilising the shower panel to the wall which if your a certain height over 6ft really doesn’t make it comfortable
My toilet roll holder was broken and my key operated electric point panel fell off the wall upon arrival
Various times during my few nights stay the place stank of fish/glue/bad plumbing 
The food on offer is beyond abysmal
I’m not sure who the staff are employed by or if many are students but no one seemed to have any idea what they were doing, even purchasing a meal wasn’t simple. Bar staff couldn’t operate the till, had to ask for help on multiple occasions and the word ‘please’ didn’t seem to be in their vocab
Also being ignored at the bar by someone clearly doing precisely nothing is beyond irritating 
I wouldn’t recommend staying here and wouldn’t want to return

Having said that...  who on earth designed the bedrooms?? 
Why on earth would you have a bed that was about a foot off a wall on one side so it’s hard to move between them and get in and out of it and on the other side a massive space that has a corner couch. a desk. chair etc. 
The corner shelf on the side of the bed against the wall holds a cube clock and a glass if you’re lucky, too small and impractical!! 
The bathroom/ wardrobe door is very heavy, once moving it could easily trap a hand in it. 
I’m intrigued that the toilet roll holder is so low to the floor!!  It needs to be about a foot higher up the wall!! 
The toiletries and towels provided are good and the shower is great. 
Food in the restaurant area could give a better variety of choice, it’s a bit basic to say the least. 
Access to the hotel is badly sign posted from the Parking areas, that certainly needs improving. The new stair access is fine but why is there not a ramp for those with mobility problems there as well. The existing airport ramps have to be used which means walking further than need be!! 
Why isn’t there an entrance onto the road level from the hotel so that there is a direct access on the same level as the terminal? 
It’s a comfortable hotel, but whoever designed it really has not thought it through !! 
It needs some consideration for those with reduced mobility!","0","","2018-09-30","2018-09-23","2018-09-23","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r618949537-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms were clean and the bathroom good with an excellent shower. Wake up call was on time as well as there being an excellent alarm clock in the room.  The coffee provided was very limited and some biscuits would have been appreciated.  The bar and restaurant area is very large with many tables.  The menu is very limited consisting of mainly burger, curry, pizza, jacket potato and sandwiches.  My wife had the jacket potato with tuna and sweetcorn, the potato was only a half and was dry and grey looking and at a cost of £7 overpriced.  I had the burger and what a disaster this was .  It was made of ground meat and was utterly tasteless, with cheese and bacon the cost of £12.95 was a complete rip off.  You would expect more choice and quality for a hotel carrying the Hilton name.  The bar prices are what you would expect from a hotel with a captive audience ,HIGH.  I would stay here again because it is convenient for the terminal and parking but I will eat somewhere else before arriving.  I would also suggest taking your own water as £1.90 for a small bottle is another rip off.","1","","2018-08-31","2018-09-22","2018-09-22","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r618582084-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is a nice comfortable hotel and ideal for a short stay. We enjoyed the breakfast with plenty of choice.
We didn’t eat in the restaurant as we tried it last year and found the menu limited and service not great.

Downside of the hotel was the noise from the plumbing and the air conditioner was noisy with what seemed to be relays clicking in and out on a regular basis.

We do find that getting heavy cases to the hotel can be quite hard especially as we are in our late sixties. However we found that if you go to long stay car park stop G which is opposite the main entrance you are allowed to take the shuttle bus back and forth, this was a huge benefit.

Room was lovely, comfortable and very clean, couldn’t have faulted it. However this was soon let down by the restaurant (if you could call it that) there were very few poor choices of simple but expensive bar snacks, we chose Nachos which were appalling, sloppy and cold and drenched in what appeared to be tomato ketchup rather than a proper salsa. Didn’t bother ordering anything else as the only choice was burgers and the table next to us were complaining to the waitress about their burgers. The bar staff were very slow with our drinks because they were so busy gossiping amongst themselves, our expensive cocktails were eventually delivered to our table which the waitress then spilled all over the place with no apology, no offer of clearing up the mess or topping up the cocktails that she spilled. When going to the bar again I was asked if I knew what measurement my Baileys should be !!  Clearly inexperienced and lacking in training, pretty disappointing for what we spent.

We parked at the adjacent multi-floor car park, an arrangement that proved ideal. The hotel impressed, in all but one regard - clean and efficiently run by friendly staff who coped very well with a number of issues we witnessed - a medical emergency among them. However, the service in the restaurant was, as we were warned by Trip Advisor, disappointingly slow at a busy time. We waited for over an hour for the ice cream that came with one child's meal. This was a pity, because although the menu was limited, the food proved surprisingly good and the main course was delivered reasonably quickly. That quibble aside, we enjoyed a very peaceful night and the usual noisy airport intrusions were completely absent; we didn't hear any aircraft taking off, nor doors slamming or people making their way up & down the corridors! Amazing sound-proofing! As for the continental breakfast - excellent! We'll certainly use this hotel again.","0","","2018-09-30","2018-09-05","2018-09-04","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r613978095-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Being so close to the airport terminal, I feared for the noise and when I was given a room overlooking the access road and the planes this just enhanced my concern. In fact, the room was very quiet. The only disturbance was a noisy A/C thermostat which kept making a loud click as it kicked in and out. The room wasn't enormous but was perfectly adequate for a short stay and the bathroom (shower only) was well appointed. The mattress (always a plus point in Hilton Hotels in my experience) was VERY firm but comfortable. Unfortunately, the down duvet was too hot for my liking even with the AC turned down to a minimum and the hotel doesn't carry blankets (why oh why do hotels around the world do this????). Breakfast was excellent for a hotel of this type - a good selection of hot and cold dishes and a good choice of fruit and cereals, and I was pleased to be able to have a good breakfast at 05:30 before I took my flight. All the major car rental companies are within walking distance so I hired my car the morning after I arrived, thereby saving one day's rental. The hotel staff was welcoming and efficient. I wouldn't want to spend a holiday there, but for a couple of nights between flights, this was a good choice.","2","","2018-08-31","2018-09-01","2018-09-01","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r612785563-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Unfortunately we were woken by an alarm in our room at midnight and a staff member had to come and turn off the aircon for it to stop, which woke our daughter and meant we could not use the aircon so it was very hot.  We had to get up at 3.45am for a flight so did not sleep much.  However, i complained at the desk in the morning and our full stay price was refunded within a couple of days and we were credited some Hilton points by way of an apology.

Unfortunately issues occur, and on the basis of the way that Hilton dealt with our issue i would absolutely recommend them for their excellent customer service.

I was able to talk to the manager about my experience but am not sure if this will make a difference. On looking at other reviews I see my complaints are similar to previous guests. Please do something about the quality of the food as it spoils a good hotel experience

We stayed before departing on holiday in a good sized and clean room. Hotel is within walking distance to terminal. Only negatives I can say now would be the car parking situation and the staff still need to be trained with it being a new hotel

Restaurant let’s the hotel down a little. Stylishly decorated but menu very basic, mainly sandwiches and jacket potatoes, would have preferred something more substantial after a day travelling. That said, service was polite and quick. Jacket potatoes with tuna mayo were ok but this menu is more of a cafe menu than a hotel one.

Checked in on Wednesday to stay for 7 nights during recent business trip. First impression clean room but very cold and noisy, air conditioning by default turned to minimum. Both air-con and fan in the bathroom extremely noisy. I was tired after trip, needed some rest, so decided to call for assistance with air-con and fan setup. Picked up the room phone to call service...no signal. Oh well, not a good start. The worst is yet to come. On Friday I left to London for business, leaving note on the door ""do not disturb"". I left some of my personal belongings and work business related documents in the room. Upon arrival on Saturday i could not re-enter my room. When spoke to staff, I was told that I was checked out by mistake, my belongings were removed from the room and no one knew what happened to it. Shocking!!!. 
From Saturday until the day of my departure no one made any proactive attempt to contact me, I needed to ask every day for updates with very little effect. 
The case was handled now to the plice to investigate. Waste of time, waste of money, stressful and disappointing treatment.
The worst hotel I have ever visited. Oh, almost forgot, if you drive there, you will have to pay £30.00 for overnight parking on top of your room price.

Enjoyed using the gym, the kind staff and the decent breakfast. Dinner options are very limited - and not great - but I can take that. 

Most of my chagrin lies in the staffing of the bar (somewhere I frequented a few times due to a cancelled flight...your honor). Generally the staff seem more concerned with doing trivial tasks rather than serving the ever growing number of people waiting to order food or drink. The absolute highlight was, as a huge line of people formed, the barman saying to his colleague (herself a trainee, new to the job and the only other staff member behind the bar) 'I'm taking my break' and proceeding to swan past the huge line at about 730pm. Genuinely never seen such flagrant disregard for customer service in my life.

There is even a small area in the front of the bar counter that sells snacks and bottled drinks. 
The hotel has two lifts which were clean and quick. The hotel corridors were colourful and quiet. Rooms are mostly uniform size and well insulated - no aircraft noise, in fact no sounds from anywhere permeated the room. Very comfortable king sized bed, arm chair with separate leg rest, writing desk with chair, remote tv, tea and coffee making up the main room, the ensuite bathroom had a walk-in shower but was so designed that there is no door or curtain. The curved side glass keeps water off the bathroom floor! Well lit and again very clean. Plenty of soap, shampoo and conditioner.
Breakfast was included and is all self service, available in a purpose built room off the lobby. Cleverly designed to avoid queuing, there was a very good variety of hot and cold foods, juices and hot drinks. Although it was busy, there was no waiting for people to move on.

Rooms are typical of most on airport hotels, well appointed and very clean with a super comfy bed.
Breakfast is very good.
Staff are nice.
Great value.
What I fail to understand is why it was built here in a hole two levels below the terminal at the far end of the airport property.
We both have walking difficulties and it IS NOT a two minute walk nor is it easy - a Fitbit said it was 3250 steps from terminal to hotel if you use the road route.
Four heavy bags, after midnight, raining — it’s a miserable walk with a trolly.
The signage is rubbish in the dark.
Why this wasn’t built opposite the terminal with a walkway between the two is a mystery - see the Gatwick example - pure ease.
This is typical of Bristol airport - NON USER FRIENDLY.
The management should be made to make the walk at midnight with four heavy bags, in the rain and then see what they say.
Pathetic position for an on airport hotel / shame because once you get there it’s nice.

I normally don't stay in hotels like this, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It was very clean, the staff was friendly, and it was literally across the street from the baggage claim. You cannot get anymore convenient than this! I was very wary to stay here because of how many people must stay here for the same reason we did, convenience. However, it exceeded my expectations. It doesn't look like tons of people stay here each night because of how clean it was. We are staying here again in September, to make an early flight to Italy. I would totally recommend it!

Great location - a few minutes stroll from airport terminal building, free parking while you drop off your bags. Nice new hotel design. 
Large seating area also used for meals etc. 
Bedroom modern and clean, smart fitness centre.

Offers simple food menu. We ordered at the same time as friends who we were sat with - nothing complicated; jacket spud and burgers. We were given a number to display on our table.  Food was being delivered by vacant looking lads who carried one plate at a time (!)
After a while our friends food came. 
As ours did not appear I ask one of the waiters, who said ‘oh ye I’ve seen some with your number in but didn’t know where you were sitting’. After another wait the jacket spud arrived - like warm but my daughter decided it was better to have something !  Still no food for the rest of us so I asked again. This time he said our food has gone so is being cooked again.  After a long wait it arrived.
RUBBISH SERVICE. Surely when the food is ready you bring it out and walk through the restaurant calling ‘order no. 30’. It’s not rocket science. 
Bar staff weren’t on top of their game either. 
We walked to M&S to get dessert and returned to seats to eat them. 
We were up too early for cooked breakfast - continental breakfast was good, plenty of choice.","2","","2018-07-31","2018-07-28","2018-07-27","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r600335045-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

After flying home from our holiday, my daughter had booked a room at this hotel 2weeks prior to our one night stay. We arrived at 03.45a.m, all four of us, my daughter, her 2 children, 15months and 8years old, and myself. We checked in, no problem went to our room, and as we let ourselves in the smell hit us, it was awful. I went into the bathroom and although the shower and wash basin looked clean the toilet certainly wasn't! The lid was up and had been left  In flushed!!! It was disgusting. Not only the smell but the state of the toilet. We were so tired so decided we wouldn't raise the problem until morning! 4hours later we were getting showered to go down stairs for breakfast. No problems there. 
On checkout the duty manager asked if our stay was ok? We told him what we had found when we arrived just a few hours before, His reply was il have to check with the housekeeper who cleaned it but it could've been a back up problem where it won't flush!!! And then proceeded to ask where we had been on holiday and did we enjoy it! There was no apology just an excuse that the toilet may have been backed up! Really??? I asked to see the manager, he said he was the duty manager so I asked what will happen once he's asked the housekeeper, he said he would email us to let us know!! 
Almost a month later we have had no email of explanation or apology which really isn't good enough. We paid a lot of money for literally 4hours in a room and not even an explanation can be made! 
We are so disappointed that I feel writing a review is our only option.","5","","2018-07-31","2018-07-22","2018-07-22","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r598581839-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We got up in the morning only to find that the shower was cold!   Reluctantly we used it as we had a long journey to take.   At Reception we told them about this issue and left if with them whilst we went for breakfast to decide what they could do.   Breakfast was a let down, nothing flows in this self service section .. it's a bit like a cross roads!   We had our full English which wasn't that hot.   I got my coffee and husband got his.   He went back for another slice of toast leaving his full coffee there,  I went up for another coffee.  On his return his plate had gone with his butter and marmalade!   The Staff on duty had seen us sat at the table so they should have paid more attention to see if we were in the self service area.   Back to Reception to see what they could do regarding our room which we had paid full price for.   At first the comment was ""It's been resolved now and you can go back if you wish""!!!   No, we have a long way to go.   Eventually after making comments about paying for a service which we haven't received the on Duty Manager gave us a partial refund.    All in all a very poor stay at the Hampton in Bristol.   Not somewhere we would want to stay again.   I know things can go wrong but it is the way in which you deal with them that make the customer return … It was a very slow response from the Duty Manager and only after it had been suggested by myself was the reduction given.

It's extremely convenient if you have a very early flight and fulfills a real need.  As you might expect from Hilton, it's very well thought out by people who know what they're doing. The staff are very professional.  Our room was very good, it had everything you might need for a short stay.  It's designed for people with an early flight out.  For example they serve breakfasts from from 4am (continental, adequate) and hot meals from 6pm.  We took a deal for one night including breakfast and with one week's parking for the car at Bristol airport's silver car park (in itself recent extensively refurbished and providing a far better service than  previously).  I can't remember exactly, but I think we paid about £120 for all that (2 people, 2 breakfasts).  The hotel has a large holding car park which you can use as you book in and you have 1 hour free to settle in.  The hotel prices for meals etc were unexpectedly inexpensive, bearing in mind it's the Hilton.  Small dishes £5ish, larger meals £12ish, that sort of range.  Very acceptable quality.  A pint of beer was around £3.50;  they really aren't taking advantage of their prime location at the moment.  It's a very easy walk to the departure lounge in the morning.  I recommend this hotel if you're taking an early flight out of Bristol;  we'll certainly use them again.","1","","2018-07-31","2018-07-15","2018-07-15","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r596423888-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We didn’t want the hassle of moving the car in the morning so plumped for the only hotel on the site of the airport.

The hotel is immaculately clean and modern. Price (booked a week before the stay) was really good value £80 especially as it included breakfast (which opens at 4am) for me and my husband.

Breakfast set up was a little confusing but it wouldn’t put me off. Definitely the most convenient option for an early flight - terminal is less than a 5 minute walk.

Only other negative - room above us were very noisy. Not sure if they were particularly heavy footed or if floors are thin. It did disturb us a couple of times.","0","","2018-07-31","2018-07-11","2018-07-11","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r595384575-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The rooms are clean and serve their purpose.  It has everything you need eg tea and coffee etc.

Breakfast was continental and there was a good selection of food but we didn’t actually have anything as 4am was a bit early.

However we found the reception staff aloof and not inclined to be helpful.  The screen on the shower area was so small that most of the bathroom was sprayed by the shower, which was a little annoying.
It is an easy distance to the airport, however the covered section is only part of the way, and due to the heavy rain at the time we needed to cross over, we got quite wet.

The food was foul but cost Hilton prices and all eaten in the bar under a tv showing a German World Cup match.

Situated 5 mins walk from the terminal, it provided a stress free start to our holiday. 

You get an hour free parking to drop bags etc off, simply give your ticket to the receptionist and they'll sort it for you. Once checked it, get your luggage up to your room. After a few minutes drive to the silver zone parking area, just drop your car keys off at the desk and they will give you a card to take with you which you present on your return. The bus will then pick you and take you back to the terminal, where you can walk back down to the hotel. Very straight forward!

We ate in the hotel too. The food was fine and was more than enough to eat. The menu is a little limited, but there should be something for everyone. Children's menu's are a sip able on request.

We didn't eat breakfast, as we wanted to get another half an hour sleep. In any case, 4am is a little early to eat if I'm honest. We ate in the airport, and whilst a little expensive, there was an abundance of choice. Nothing much else to do anyway, so may as well eat!

When we next fly from Bristol we will be sure to stay at this hotel.

Breakfast was very good. Completely self serve but such a wide choice available. Fresh fruits, porridge continental and full English all available. Staff are all pleasant and friendly, and a good ambience in the foyer area where a small bar serves reasonably priced drinks and there is a small tv area ( World Cup viewing for those who wanted it)

Reception staff were welcoming, the room had plenty of space for luggage, there was a comfortable bed and arm chair and a good shower. The early morning call was bang on time. The bar/restaurant is spacious and the food was surprisingly good. We ate in the bar and it was reasonably priced and very good. The atmosphere was pleasant and not as souless as many airport hotels. Continental breakfast begins at 4 (cooked from 6), and it was all ready at that time ~ a reasonable range and far better than the one we had at the Gatwick Hilton by Hampton. If you ask for a box you can pack a breakfast to take into the terminal, if you prefer.
There is a hotel car park, which is free for the first hour so you can check in before moving the car to whichever car park you have booked. Hotel parking is more expensive than the long stay, so we moved our car ~ very easy walking distance to the car park. The only criticism is the walk from the hotel to the terminal. It is worth noting that this hotel is NOT attached to the terminal. Hilton have utilised the existing paths, so you have to pull your cases up a couple of long slopes; however, there is plenty of room for a more compact access alongside the steps. It was fine on a dry June morning, but I would have been less happy on a wet November day! It is something to bear in mind if you have mobility problems though. Halfway along the path is a stand of luggage trolleys, but you need a couple of pounds to unlock one. 
We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely use this hotel again, if we had an early flight from Bristol.","1","","2018-06-30","2018-06-25","2018-06-24","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r590436711-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

It was a mixed experience. 

Pros:

Helpful, friendly staff
Location - 5 min walk to airport
Comfortable bed
2 soft drinks and 2 chocolate bars for Hilton gold members

Cons:

I arrived just after 9pm and good service was in melt down. Lots of complaints of people waiting over an hour for food. Eat before you arrive. 
Shower was hot or cold and difficult to get to a comfortable temperature 
Shower drain blocked

On balance I would stay here again. It’s just too convenient! However they need to fix the food situation and would benefit from a little more attention to detail. 

My tip would be to book parking online with Bristol airport in the multi-storey. It’s a 2 minute walk and better value than the hotel.

The evening food menu is very limited for choice and there is a big shortage of staff on the bar which becomes a bit confused as it kind of falls into reception, I don't think the open plan design of it works really.
Staff this visit were all really friendly, we ended up ringing reception to ask for a change of room and the air con/extract unit in the bathroom was so noisy and were told that they have many complaints of the same problem, seems the hotel needs some work to fix this, our new room didn't have the loud noise but the air con didn't work properly so it was a warm night and it wap too late to change room again.

Another fantastic experience ","This was our 2nd stay at the hotel. On this occasion, it was after a late night flight into Bristol. 
Reception - extremely efficient and quick check in by friendly staff (we were in our room within minutes)
Room - lovely size, immaculately clean with everything you need comfortable beds, quality bedding, tea/coffee, shower gels, shampoo, body lotion, etc plus iron and ironing board. Rooms are so quiet, which is brilliant given the close proximity to the airport plus the number of travellers.
Food - we only had breakfast this time, which was again very good. It was hot, plentiful, and varied. 
Staff - all very friendly, efficient and helpful. Keith in the breakfast room today, was very friendly, helpful and kind. 

Excellent hotel, in prime location. Looking forward to our next stay in autumn

It's not cheap..£10.95 I wonder how much we'd get back for the lack of coleslaw? We didn't bother finding out!
This is the third time we have stayed here and every time we come they have run out of wine.

The sofabed is also like rock, our 12 Year old had to sleep on it sofa style as it was so uncomfortable, not to mention the lack of bottom sheets!

As Hilton Hhonors members we could check in online via the app and when we arrived, Reception were expecting us and handed us our room key.
The room was very comfortable and adequate for our needs. As other reviewers have said, it is immediately across the road from the airport but in spite of this there is no noise at all. I agree the menu is limited for choice but we both had a meal and found this to be excellent - if a little on the expensive side. However, we were aware of this and as we were on holiday - indulged. The bed was comfortable and we managed to sleep before rising at 3.30 to cross to the airport for check in.
There is a covered walkway so far then you either go up steps to the terminal or you follow a path for step free access - either way it is no worse than crossing to the Hilton Gatwick from the South Terminal there.
All in all an excellent stay and a lovely start to our holiday. Would we stay again? - Most definitely. Would we recommend? - Certainly.  Try it - I'm sure you will not be disappointed as it is both comfortable and convenient for the airport terminal.
In closing I should add that the staff were excellent - all very friendly, professional and welcoming, which is another plus point in recommending the hotel and encouraging us to want to stay again.","4","","2018-06-30","2018-06-16","2018-06-16","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r587835803-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The bar however was both under stocked (4 things we asked for, they had run out of) and they were understaffed, they had 2 people on the bar to take food orders and serve drinks which meant the wait to be served was about 15 minutes.

Then we come to the menu and food, this has to be one of the worst choices of menu I have ever had in a hotel, very very basic menu and the food wasn’t much better, I had a burger and would have been better with a cheap frozen burger coked at home, no flavour and very little meat in it more bulking agent.

On arrival there was a queue of very tired looking travellers and as we observed the slowness of the 2 reception staff I and my wife were slowly losing the will to live ! In the night The fire alarm went off , 4 a.m for about a minute, then stopped for a short time and went off again  and again.  Eventually it stopped but a brilliant red flashing light carried on illuminating our room for some minutes.  Looking through the window I saw some guests in night clothing, pyjamas walking in and out of the hotel and the manager allowing people back in while he struggled at the fire panel by the exit door. I phoned reception to be told there was no fire and it was set off by accident and the duty manager was unavailable as he was with maintenance. We were unable to get back to sleep.  The next morning I asked what compensation we would get as I thought it extremely bad that the duty manager could not deactivate the alarm in one go instead of letting it carry on several times but I was met with a blank stare, a verbal sorry and told I was being aggressive!!! I was angry, not aggressive. I asked could I have free parking as a gesture ( £16 is the overnight fee !!!!! ) and was told this was not possible.

Check in was quick and efficient, and the rooms were very comfortable, quiet and well equipped.

There is a large bar area which serves drinks and snacks. However the system they have for serving is ridiculous and lets the hotel down. You order drinks and food from the same till and so all night from 6.30 - 8.30 there was a queue of around 6-8 people waiting to be served. People were understandingly getting frustrated and so were ordering several rounds at a time which just added to the problem. When I complained I was told they were unable to offer waiter service so we had to go to the bar. I would suggest that they have either separate tills for food, or else have somebody walking around taking food orders from people seated who will be adding the cost to their bill.
By 8.00 pm they had also run out of 2 of the 3 dishes I wanted.

Breakfast was included in the price and was good quality, hot and varied.","2","","2018-06-30","2018-06-13","2018-06-13","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r587226576-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Then we got into the room and had been given a disabled room, with a wet room, having a two year old with me after a whole day of traveling it was not ideal as I couldn’t bath or wash her as I was scared she would slip over. Then there was trying to get to sleep with what sounded like a water boiler heating up continuously throughout the night, I had to call reception in the end because I had been trying to sleep for an hour and a half and every time I nearly got to sleep the noise would happen again. I was told it was the air conditioning and to turn it off, I did and it still continued throughout the night. I got a total of 3 hours sleep maximum which was great for a 3 and a half hour drive home. When I asked the receptionist in the morning what was going on I just about got a sorry no offer of any compensation or anything for a terrible night.

Rooms are a good size with comfy beds - although I agree with other comments that the air conditioning system is very loud, which woke me up several times in the night. A fridge would've been useful in the room for bottles of water etc, although I'm aware they want you to pay restaurant prices. Hot breakfast was only available from 6am, which is a shame for travellers who leave before then.

While I understand the car parking prices are set by Bristol Airport, my partner was charged a few pounds solely to drop me off (under 20 minutes).

Would stay again if I can get for around £70 a night.","0","","2017-10-31","2018-06-12","2018-06-12","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r586888458-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Position, is everything and this Hotel is right there within walking distance of the Terminal... Everything was a-okay and then some.

Check-in was a breeze and very pleasant. 

Rooms were superb and very comfortable.

We enjoyed the little restaurant area for dinner and an early cooked breakfast.
 
I wouldn't hesitate to use this excellent hotel again if I had an early flight, it takes so much stress out of the whole thing with the added bonus of extra hours sleep.

The airport was easily accessible via an exit in the restaurant area where you go through a tunnel under the road. The two flights of stairs up to the road crossing were very manageable if not inconvenient but it is what it is, I was happy enough to do it.

My top tip, foam ear-plugs, I never travel without them and they guarantee a peaceful nights sleep ...

Thank you ... Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport.","1","","2018-05-31","2018-06-10","2018-06-10","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r586357401-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Check-out rapid.

My only real criticism is that if you care carrying heavy cases the its a long walk up ramps to airport if you want to avaoid steps.

Ok so the menu is a bit limited for other times, but it is available 24/7 so I don't expect an enormous choice. Its ok price wise, not too expensive. The rooms were really light, spacious and very comfortable., Didn't hear a thing all night. So my only gripe is the parking. No where is it mentioned on the Hilton website and we had to pay the discounted rate of £16.50 for 15 hours in the hotel. I say thats a lot. Why its so dear I don't know but it lets down the Hilton and Id think twice about returning for that reason alone. If you stay at a hotel parking is usually thrown in or nominally £5 a day. So beware the hidden parking.

BUT, if you are a couple who are getting on in years who have never travelled light on a two-week holiday to the Med and who fancy something more than a burger, a curry of the week or a salmon fillet, then the Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport is definitely not for you.
The hotel is new, clean and quiet, BUT the menu is unbelievably limited and then there is the long and torturous walk from the hotel to the terminal – see photos. First you need to walk to the covered walkway, then walk up the gradual incline, then out into the open air and perhaps the rain, then a short walk to the first challenging 14 steps then another short walk before the next challenging 15 steps then onto the pavement, then negotiate the busy road in front of the airport, then finally into the terminal – sweating profusely and totally exhausted!
“Ah!” I hear the hotel staff say “But you do not need to climb the 29 steps. You can use the long and winding ramp and spend more time in the open air and perhaps in the rain.”
With just a bit of imagination Hilton could have employed a clever architect to design a covered walkway from a higher floor, accessed by a lift which could have provided direct covered access to the airport terminal.

The bathroom extractor fan was very noise, like a plane taking off. I had to cover it with a towel/toilet paper to make it quiet. All through the night there was clicking of switches, the sound of what I believe was water pipes/heating systems were very loud and seemed to be happening very regular. It wasn't even for water in our room. I can't really explain it well, maybe we were just unlucky on the 3rd floor but either way I was awake more than I was asleep. Also to be picky the alarm clock was very bright. Im not petty, just need quiet and darkness to sleep well, which I certainly didn't get.

The family room was great, fresh and crunchy clean beds, welcoming atmosphere. No problems there.

The problem was the ""food"", if you can call it food. The menu is poor, limited, very little choice. I ordered beef burger and had to wait 30 minuted for it to arrive. Finally, it arrived and the look of it disgusted me to my stomach.  The burger bread was super dry, no sauce on it, then the beef which looked more like a rat's meet. The color was grey greenish, dry, and i mean just dry, a suspicious large not so fresh green leave on it and ta daaaa, enjoy your ""meal"", if you can say so.
I was very hungry, so closed my eyes and had a bite. It was the most disgusting burger i've ever tasted. It had no taste. It literally tasted like rat's meat. I am saying this, because that taste was uknown to me. (Rat's meat is uknown to me.)
It didn't end there. I complained and got it changed to the special chicken masala. It was ok, but because i was very very hungry.  I wasn't feeling good after the ""meal"", so eventually i got a sick stomach at night and before departure. I'm still not feeling well.

What a great business model.

The first time we stayed here we had no major problems. The rooms were comfortable, with the sofa bed made up and had everything we needed. The only thing missing was an extra towel because there were only two and there were three of us and we could have asked to get one but it wasn’t essential. 

However, the second time we were less impressed that the sofa bed wasn’t even made up when we arrived. We had to do it ourselves and okay we could have asked but we shouldn’t have to. Again we didn’t have enough towels for the three of us but that wasn’t a major issue. 

However, that said, we have been impressed with the food in the bar and the drinks, although a little pricey but it’s understandable with the location. The breakfast seems very good and overall we were very happy. The hotel seemed quiet and comfortable and we will be back.

Sleep Quality: 1","Great location but very noisy at night","We booked this hotel because we had an early morning flight from Bristol. We live 2 hrs away so wanted to not miss out on too much sleep the night before and be right on the doorstep on the day we were travelling. The room was very noisy at night. Either water pipes or a heating system located above our room above made so much noise I was awake past 2.30am and we needed to wake up at 3.30am! getting 1 hrs sleep before you travel is not ideal and completely defeated the objective of our stay. Our hotel stay was pointless as I was completely exhausted when we travelled the next day. We left the hotel quickly and there was no chance to give any feedback on departure. I had the impression from the level of interest we had from the receptionists upon check in, that they wouldn't have cared anyway.  On check in, I had a stamped birthday card I needed to post, and I asked the receptionist really nicely If I could please put it in your post box but she said 'we don't have one you will have to post it at the airport'. My husband and I both work in the hotel industry and I find it very hard to believe that any hotel/business address has no post collection service! As a result, my mother in law didn't get a birthday card because there was no post box at the airport. Our fault for not posting it on the way to Bristol, but we never thought twice about the fact that we couldn't be able to post it at the hotel, and I was really shocked at the unwillingness to help from the receptionist. Room was clean, and the restaurant staff very friendly. Food was ok, but a very limited menu. Hotel has a very fresh and modern feel, and the location is the best feature without question. However, if you're looking for a good nights seep, don't expect one!","1","","2018-04-30","2018-04-17","2018-04-17","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r573953318-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The room is actually very nice, it was clean and had nice facilities. It is however an airport hotel - but this is the noisiest airport hotel I have ever stayed in. There appears to be very little soundproofing as I could hear a lot of noise for outside during the night and also water and creaking noise from above the ceiling - thinking it was the air con I turned this off in the night but to no avail the noise was still there it can be heard above the entrance part of the room ALL night - room 202. 
I reported this to reception in the morning but mostly the girls on reception then were too busy talking amongst themselves to be remotely interested in the fact that I was complaining and just said sorryyyy and carried on talking. So customer service has not been fought either. 
I am very disappointed and will probably revert back to the holiday inn in the future.

On arrival we were very impressed - the hotel is very modern and well presented, however after we checked in our first experience of a “Hampton by Hilton Hotel” went rapidly downhill. The room was really just for 3 people, a nice double bed, but with a rock hard and small sofa bed (quite cosy for a 14 year old and his 11 year old brother) 3 x towels and 2 mugs. Really disappointed. I did suggest to the management that it was not really fit for our purpose but their response was we could have another room for an additional £50 - hardly helpful (we thought we had booked a family room, at £120 we certainly paid for one), but I picked up on where the focus appears to lie. The evening meals were expensive and underwhelming (I have had bigger starters than the curry I had); add on the leaving whammy of paying another £16.50 (on top of the £120 already paid for the box room) just to park the car over night and the whole experience was over priced and pretty dreadful. That said the staff were fantastic and they deserve better than trying to defend this rather poor offering. Premier Inn for me next time, sure it’s a 15 / 20 min drive away, but is superior in every department - convenience is great but it’s a mistake to abuse that and from what my family experienced (on our first visit) we would not risk it again.","1","","2018-04-30","2018-04-12","2018-04-12","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r572913325-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We checked in at about 8 pm and there was a little bit of a queue but didn't take very long.

Snacks consist of crisps and chocolates and then there's waters or some fizzy alternatives; I thought this was a really nice touch. 

Our room was on the third floor, very well put together, new, fresh, whites mixed with aqua-marine, soft sea blue and natural earth tones throughout. Perfectly fine bathroom with a large shower; the entrance to the room hosted a huge mirror, then there was a small entertainment unit with TV and tea/coffee making facilities, adjacent to a desk with wheelie chair and opposite a small two-person L-shaped couch, large bedside table/draws and a queen comfy bed. Even though the air conditioning was off it was loud throughout the night, banging and making strange noises, waking me up on several occasions; this is the only thing that I'd say was less than great.  

We received a complimentary continental breakfast (which starts at 4 am and ends at 6 am I believe, then there's a hot breakfast after that). We had a time for a swift espresso, few slices of meat and cheese, a croissant and some fruit. Love that there are so many charging points through the hotel, both in the room and in the very stylish check desk come bar and dining areas. 

Overall, a great hotel and a very reasonable place to stay before an early morning flight.","1","","2018-04-30","2018-04-09","2018-04-09","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r572088023-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We had a disruptive night sleep with a noisy fan that kept waking us up.

For modern hotel it only had a very austere bar area. Not at all comfortable with being as it seemed in a shopping concourse . Open cold and featureless. It was very windy and cold even snowing outside and the huge automatic doors let blasts of freezing air into the space. Resorted to eating back on the A38 as to eat here - and only a burger type menu was very unappealing. The room itself was a bit cool but that was due to the heating system not having enough oomph to heat the hotel I suspect. Bonus an airport display board arrivals and departures made keeping abreast of the flight easy. Another negative , the breakfast self service area  is lacking in signing and searching out associated items butter for toast and milk for cereals - where are the bowls ? etc. made that an inconvenient start to the day as others were also milling about trying to make sense of this too.  Parking fees are extortionate beware .

The rooms were clean and well furnished which one would expect from a new hotel, albeit small. 

Anybody reading the website would know that parking is charged for, so be prepared for that, but the good news is that it is reduced for those staying overnight.

The breakfast was reasonable and there was a good choice between continental and cooked (depending on the time of the morning). Having read about the food situation we opted to find a local hostelry to eat in for dinner, but the added bonus was that we were able to have the first parking period for free: we only paid for the subsequent overnight parking.

I will agree with some contributors that the heating was not overly brilliant and was occasionally marred by loud clunks from the system. The thermostat also did not seem to be very effective as the room remained cold even when set to the maximum of 25 degrees.

Staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. This did appear to be a calm period so people did not appear to be rushed off their feet, so cannot comment on what it would be like during busy periods.

Would stay here again if necessary and would recommend to others with the caveats about eating, parking and heating.","1","","2018-04-30","2018-04-03","2018-04-03","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r570707048-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We ordered a pizza and duck spring rolls, which were very tasty but we waited well over an hour! We had a continental breakfast as we were too early for  the hot food option but it was plentiful. We did complain to the very nice receptionist about the noisy air con and lack of sleep and she refunded the room amount (£84) with no quibbles.Fair play, this was brilliant and unexpected.

There is one hour free parking outside the hotel so you can check in and drop off your bags. You can then park wherever you like for your holiday. 

Check in was straight forward and welcoming. 

The lobby area is quite informal and relaxing with a bar area along with 3/4 televisions. It also has the airport feed with flight arrival and departure times live.

Rooms seem fresh and clean. Tv, tea/coffee facilities, good sized shower along with complementary shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Plenty of towels. Hairdryer, iron and ironing board as standard along with a room safe. Extra tea and coffee were available from reception.

Lots of freeview channels and free WiFi.

Continental breakfast is served from 4am which had a variety of cereals, pastries, waffles, teas, coffee, dairy and vegan milk, juices and fruit. Full breakfast available from 6am. 

Hotel shuttle available to the terminal but only a very short walk with steps or ramp for those with mobility issues. 

Overall, an excellent stay. 

Would like to see some sort of outdoor space for time to relax the day before or after a flight. ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/71/77/fb/photo0jpg.jpg

I understand that they are trying to fix the noise pollution problem and improve the heating system. I had an issue with the payment as it seemed like they made me pay twice for the room.

No restaurant as such and a limited food menu - pizza, burgers and sandwiches basically. Considering there is only a couple of cafes in the terminal before security and no other restaurant nearby you would think the food options would be better.

One note - do not order the chicken burger as it was awful! Saying that the breakfast was good and included in with the price. 

The best thing is that it is a short walk to the airport, less than 5 minutes and is the nearest hotel by far. We did not hear any plane noise which I was amazed about.

No eggs at breakfast and we accept that the hotel did n to get a delivery due to poor weather however again, with good forecasting the F&B Manager could have taken this into consideration perhaps (we were all warned about the weather)?

On return we also stayed as got back at 23.00 and wanted a good sleep before drive home . Checked in no problem , rooms clean . Went to bar for a quick drink before bed (Not Bacardi obviously) to be greeted by a very charming member of staff called Landra, (Not!!) Decided she couldn't cope with the 8 people that we're there and shut the 24hr bar ! She spent so long arguing over how busy she was that it wouldve been quicker to serve customers , only to turn around and do her hair in the mirror ! So we decided to go to bed . Next morning we went down for breakfast which was ok but no eggs due to weather when all the roads were clear . Surely a member of staff could've just pooped to local shop and bought some ? 
On top of this when showering the water wouldn't drain away so only 1 of 3 of us got showered ! In our other room there was a turd I  the toilet on arrival as well . 
Decided to report our issues on check out and to be fair to receptionist she said she would discuss with manager and discount our bill , which we accepted . Only for them to charge my credit card full amount literally minutes after we left !!
Have stayed at premier inn sidcot on several occasions and will be next time as well . If you only want a convenient room then this will be ok ish , but not for me again .
Prefer somewhere where they make you feel welcome , do good food and actually have some drinks behind bar.

This new modern Hotel is in a great location and conveniently situated for the terminal just a short walkway partially covered then steps up to the terminal. This proved challenging in the deep snow and carrying the luggage up the steps was tricky as the snow had not been cleared.  The room was comfy and clean but unfortunately even with the thermostat set as high as it would go at 25 degrees there was little heat. The bathroom was also very cold, not what you want when it's freezing outside and a blizzard. There seemed to be a problem with the entire ventilation system it was clattering & banging and woke us several times during the night. I thought someone was trying break into the room! The duvet was also quite thin so little warmth to get from that. The safe in our room had several numbers on the keypad that wouldn't register so a bit random finding a pin that worked to lock it. We had two friends with us who also experienced the same issues in their room and a safe that wouldn't lock! The public areas were also not very warm but it was extreme weather outside. The doors kept sliding open to allow people in and out at both entrances to the Hotel which created a very drafty wind tunnel it was freezing if you were sat nearby. There were plenty of seating areas in the bar and a reasonable menu of snacks and meals. The food was acceptable and we didn't wait too long for the burgers we ordered. There's a very good choice at the buffet breakfast serving continental from 4am or hot breakfast choices from 6am. The staff were very friendly & helpful, I would have given a higher rating had I felt cozy & warm and the noise from the ventilation wasn't an issue in us getting a good night sleep. Being a Hilton Honors member we have experienced other Hampton Inns of better standard.

Service: 3","Generally OK but some key areas for improvement","To start with the positives, the hotel is well located for the terminal, check-in/out was efficient and the room/hotel was clean with a comfortable bed and chair.  The inclusive breakfast was also a good spread, although felt a little canteen-like (but I appreciate this I almost certainly the 'brand style').  Unfortunately there were several key aspects which made my stay rather disappointing, especially for the rates currently being charged.

Firstly signage from the terminal is less than ideal.  On approach from the airport flyer bus stop it felt right to walk under the covered walkway which was straight ahead, but I ended up in a carpark (with the hotel to my right, the other side of a fence and road).  Luckily there was a parking attendant who directed me back to terminal and across the zebra crossing opposite the arrivals door.  At this point I did see the hotel signage and the remainder of the route was obvious.  This sign would be visible when exiting the terminal, but is not in line of sight for those walking along the footpath.  Unless I missed another sign, I think signage could definitely be improved.

Secondly, as a diamond elite member I was entitled to a complimentary drink and snack from the bar, using the voucher supplied at check-in.  Unfortunately the queue for the bar was extremely long (15-20 mins), and didn't seem to get any shorter all night!  It was clear that everyone was ordering food alongside drinks, and staff couldn't cope.  In my case to avoid the lengthy wait it would have been helpful if the voucher could have been redeemed at the check-in desk, but separate to this there must be another way to speed up the queue.  It also didn't seem a great design that the queue blocks the main walkway between entrance and check-in, and that every time the main door opened we were stood in a cold draught.  Newspapers around the seating area were also several days old.

I was aware of ongoing issues with the air conditioning in guest rooms, having already read many reviews on Trip Advisor.  I contacted the hotel a couple of days prior to my stay, and was assured that only a handful of rooms were impacted.  Despite the cold night, I made a point of making sure the system was off before going to sleep but regrettably I was awoken several times during the night with very loud clicking and 'whooshing' noises.  There was little point trying to get moved to another room at that time so I sat it out but was very frustrated (and quite cold, because the duvet seemed quite thin).  A related problem also appears to be the metal grilles under the A/C units above the door entrance which rattle.  I am amazed that this issue was not identified and rectified prior to opening, or certainly not before now.  I am also very surprised that as a known problem, highlighted as applicable to my stay at check-out, that no compensation by way of a points gesture was offered.

I have thought carefully about what rating to give my review, however unfortunately my experience was lower than I would expect for this type of hotel.  As a result I cannot currently rate it as average or higher, however I would happily return once the air conditioning is 'fixed', and expect the rating should then be at least 4 out of 5.","1","","2018-02-28","2018-03-04","2018-03-04","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r564349338-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

It was a good plan! The room was clean, bright and airy with all the facilities you might need (including hairdryer!) The bed was very comfy and the room had more power points than I have ever seen in a hotel room before. The Wi-fi was free and worked well throughout the hotel. The staff were helpful and friendly. 

There is not a huge menu for the evening meal; it is somewhat limited, but if you like a burger, pizza, curry or salad, you’ll be fine. It was however a bit draughty in the lounge/ dining area. These are the only aspects which brought down my scoring. 

If you’re travelling early, they have a buffet continental breakfast available from 4 am and that is included in the cost. We paid £77 for a double room on a Friday night which for an airport hotel, I thought was excellent value. 

It is a short walk to the terminal building, so very convenient. ","2","","2018-03-31","2018-03-03","2018-03-02","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r563800582-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We chose a package including car parking for the duration of our holiday. Entry to the car park was straight forward as the system recognised the number of the car and gave us a prepaid ticket.  We parked as close to the hotel as possible. We have had trouble finding our car at Bristol before as the car park is very big so we took a phone photo of the sign marking the space. 

Access to the hotel was a bit difficult as they are building a multi storey car park and a large area is fenced off. We should have off loaded the bags at the hotel then parked to save dragging heavy cases a long way.

The hotel is only about two years old so is modern and tidy. Check in was handled efficiently and we were soon in our room. The accommodation was as expected in this style of hotel with everything needed for an overnight stay and well presented.  After a comfortable sleep we awoke early as we aimed to be at check in by 5.30am. A cold buffet is served from 4.00 am.  Checkout was simple and we had some breakfast before walking to the terminal. Much of the route is under cover but does involve a climb up to the terminal entrance. There are steps for a direct route or ramps suitable for cases on wheels. This route is longer so allow time. A bit of early morning exercise is a good idea before a four hour flight.

Picking up the car on our return was simple, aided by the photo, and we were soon on our way.

Altogether a comfortable well organised hotel making for a convenient departure from Bristol Airport. We will certainly use it again in the future.","5","","2018-01-31","2018-02-14","2018-02-14","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r560382795-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

There were a few positives to our experience there, but also a few disappointments. On the positive side, the hotel is clean, staff extremely pleasant and attentive and the hotel is very convenient for Bristol airport.  However, there were a few niggles to our experience; the dinner menu has very little choice and not good value for money, you have to collect you own cutlery from baskets, which I found most unhygienic, who knows what dirty hands have previously been rummaging through the baskets? The rooms are extremely small, so cramped, made worse if you have an extra bed in the room for a child. We had to leave the  hotel by 6am, as the majority of most of their customers would, we couldn't smell a sausage, no cooked breakfast prior to 6am which is very disappointing as you rave ""start the day with a hot buffet breakfast included in your stay"" - would be interested to know how many guests miss out on the cooked breakfast because they need to leave by 6am. The last niggle for us was the walk in the dark, fully laden with golf clubs and suitcases, we experienced no lights up the pathway to the airport and two or three sets  of steps to negotiate. You should be proud of your staff at Hampton by Hilton Bristol hotel, but you need to improve on the basics that you can address as it's not cheap to stay there (you obviously can't change the room size now, but take it forward to the next project!!).

Five minutes walk to airport/long stay","We parked in the official Bristol Airport long stay (the hotel parking is prohibitively expensive though they do permit you a ten minute grace period at the hotel to park, drop off bags and then go to an airport car park).
The hotel is smart, airy, staffed with pleasant, efficient people.  It was really nicer than I expected.
Our room was fine - beds were good, bathroom fine.  The only sound we heard was when our neighbour showered..
Quite a few rooms have adjoining doors, so with this being an airport hotel there is a risk of being disturbed by an early riser. 
The continental breakfast is served from 4am. Hot breakfast from 6am.  The coffee machine latte was sublime and breakfast was just fine.","1","","2018-02-28","2018-02-05","2018-02-05","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r558519943-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Getting here from Bristol train station using the Airport Shuttle bus – cost £8 each for a single – and that bus dropped us off right outside the terminal. From there it was a short walk across a couple of pedestrian crossings and down a flight or two of steps, though there is a separate ramped route, to the hotel.

When we checked in we were attended to by very friendly and helpful front desk staff.

Comfy room, good size nice easy chair and footstool, good desk chair and writing desk facility, decent television, kettle and coffee making facilities, comfy bed and nice bedlinen. 
Wedidn’t find it immediately, but there is a safe in the top drawer of the bedside chest.

The room was very quiet even though we were right beside the airport.

There was a well appointed shower room and good shower; shampoo, conditioner and soap dispensers in shower, and hand soap and body lotion dispensers also beside the wash handbasin.

There was good wardrobe hanging space, and an effective heating system, except it made other noises intermittently at night even after we turned turn it off. Had to turn off bedside clock because put out so much light which disturbed our sleep.

The excellent broadband was very easy to connect to, though on an unsecured network. 

There is a decent restaurant area, contemporary furnishings nicely done, and we had a nice cheeseburger and chips and drinks provided very promptly after ordering.

A continental breakfast is available from 4 AM and cooked breakfasts from 6 AM. We had to leave to catch a very early flight and so we used continental breakfast. Good selection of cereals, pastries, cold meats, fruit, toaster and brown and white bread, coffee from an automatic machine dispensed different sorts of coffee. “Carry out” bags are available if you just wanted to grab a few bits and make yourself breakfast “to go”.

In all this was a very comfortable and convenient experience for us. Very easy to find a hotel, and it has plenty of parking if you want driving to it, and it is only a very few minutes walk across to the departures airport terminal.

It will certainly be an option we consider it again next time we have to fly from Bristol.","2","","2018-01-31","2018-02-01","2018-02-01","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r557691488-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

It is located directly across the road from Bristol airport (3 minute walk!). The hotel itself is very modern. The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable and I have not experienced any noise disturbance during either of my stays. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The bar food is excellent and there are a varied range of dishes to choose from. Breakfast is automatically included in the price of your room and is open from 5am which is fantastic if you have to catch an early flight. I must point out that I personally found the room price in this hotel extremely reasonable, and was surprized on my first visit to discover that breakfast was automatically included. I have often paid higher rates in other hotels just for the room alone! The hotel is located approx 30 minutes from Bristol city centre. We take the airport shuttle bus from Temple Meads train station out to the airport/hotel and have also used it when going from the hotel into the city centre. It is very convenient as it runs frequently and is reasonably priced. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to others and hope to stay here again when flying in/out of Bristol.","1","","2017-09-30","2018-01-29","2018-01-29","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r557060379-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Public areas are spacious and comfortable. The rooms are ultra-modern, generous size with a top quality walk-in shower. The beds are very comfortable. Wi-fi is free to all guests with a reasonable signal and speed. Modern flatscreen TV with the British FreeView package. Unfortunately, with many of those channels not working. That is annoying as there is not much else to do here.

Noise insulation room/room, room/corridor and room/outside world very good. However, sadly, that is occasionally spoiled by noisy aircon which comes to life and jingles during the night like Santa’s sleigh. Otherwise, a very good sleep in a very comfortable bed.

I have visited before but only on a day business event. Food was very good back then but sadly, seems to have deteriorated since. Cuisine is only ever going to be basic here but it seemed a real struggle to produce hot, edible sausage and mash.

You cannot beat this place for convenience and comfort. It is the only airport hotel on site, with literally minutes walk to the terminal. Herein lies the problem - a touch of complacency.

I do not expect miracles from a Hampton but there are problems and some slippage here which management should address. Otherwise I would have given top marks. A kitchen which cannot produce bangers & mash would be a good starting point for improvement!

It’s just a couple of minutes’ safe and well lit walk to the terminal building so really ideal. Staff very friendly and happy to pass the time of day. Check in was prompt, informative and cheerful.

Being a limited service hotel, the food options aren’t extensive but we enjoyed the curry of the week which was hot, tasty and just the right amount. 

The room was very well appointed and the bed SUPER comfy, we both awoke fresh, despite the early hour. The bathroom has a great shower, perfect for waking up under at an ungodly hour! Breakfast for early flyers is served continental from 4am with hot items after 6am. There was plenty of choice on the continental with cereals, toast, pastries, porridge pots, fruits, juices and hot drinks - a great start to the day! 

The hotel was clean and well presented and although very busy with a high turnover of people, staff worked quickly to keep the tables clean and clear to keep the bar area nice to stay in.

I did have one little issue while I was there (an honest mistake) which was rectified by Jess on reception who has obviously embraced her training and the Hilton values. Not only this, I had a follow up email from her supervisor just to check that all was ok - great customer service!

I will actively seek to stay here another time if I have an early flight and would urge you to do the same!

Room was clean, modern and warm. It's about a 2 min walk from the terminal so perfect if you have an early flight. I thought the room was really expensive for what it was - the price I paid I really expected a bath or something just a bit flasher. It was still a good room though. Breakfast was included and there were  good continental options (after 6am they start the hot options, my flight was very early so didn't get to try). Overall a clean and modern airport that provides a restful stay before an early flight!","1","","2018-01-31","2018-01-13","2018-01-13","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r553554019-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Lovely room, queen double, very comfy bed,  everything very clean, nice bathroom too.  Breakfast also very good.  Continental served from 4 am, very nice with everything you need and a coffee cup so you can take it with you avoiding high airport coffee shop prices!  Cooked breakfast from 6 am but I ad an early flight so can't comment on this element.  Parking expensive but check with reception on pricing when you get there, I understand it's variable, depends on whether you're a hotel guest or just dropping someone off.

The external sound-proofing is good, so we were not aware of aircraft noise. The room was a reasonable size, clean and well-designed, with a comfortable bed. And the staff were very pleasant and helpful. However: 1) The sound-proofing within the hotel is not good -we were kept awake by noise from the heating/air-conditioning system, and the plumbing both within our room and from adjoining rooms. 2) The dinner menu is fairly basic - of the pizza and burger variety. 3) The breakfast is 'free' (ie the cost is built into the room rate) and again is a fairly limited buffet. More problematic was that the so-called hot buffet (bacon, sausages, scrambled (but no other) eggs and tomatoes) was in practice barely lukewarm, and was cold before one had chance to eat it all.","2","","2018-01-31","2018-01-10","2018-01-10","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r552947781-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Service: 3","Very nice, just don’t be in a hurry","This is a new hotel, (I think it opened 2017,) and just a few minutes walk from the Terminal and car rental area. It has a huge open lobby/bar/restaurant area and fresh, modern décor. My room, while a little small, was comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate. I especially liked the walk-in shower. The bed was comfortable and lighting was very good. (No USB points though.) 

There was quite a lot of noise from the adjoining rooms, and a lot of guests seems to let their kids treat the hallways as a playroom. Not much fun when you have an early flight next day.

I ate in the restaurant, which was okay. Food quality was good but there’s a very limited range to choose from. (And for American visitors, remember to order at the bar. Don’t wait for table service!)

My gripes: when I checked in the receptionist was frankly unfriendly. I felt I was disturbing whatever else she had going on. A simple smile would have made me feel more welcome. And at checkout, well there was only one person serving, very slowly. This is an airport hotel! People have planes to catch and we really don’t want to be waiting in line. So here’s my tip: allow plenty of time to check out.","1","","2017-12-31","2017-12-26","2017-12-26","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r549362992-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

It’s a few minutes walking distance from the airport and there is a choice of a ramp or steps to get to departures.
Parking is expensive £16.50 per day.
There is a totally unnecessary charge of £1 for a drop off.
If you are paying nigh on £100 per night this should not be charged as extra.
The hotel is very quiet considering the proximity to the runway.
Staff are friendly and efficient but I  think that there should be an offer to take luggage to the rooms.
The hotel is cold!!
The ground floor temperature is acceptable but corridors are distinctly chilly as was my room on arrival. I had to raise the thermostat to 24 degrees to reach an acceptable temperature and this took some time.
I also had to leave the bathroom door open to warm it up in there.
When standing near the window with window and curtains closed there is a cold draft which may  explain why the hotel feels cold.
Having said this, the queen room I booked was very clean and a good size and the bed very comfortable.
Sandwiches made by bar staff were fresh and tasty and the continental breakfast was good except for the lack of decent bread and no bread rolls.
Sliced bread is not enough.
The choice of a cooked breakfast after 6am is great and it looked pretty good.
On the whole I would give the hotel 8/10 but there are details that need sorting out.

Rather than drive the 2 hour + journey home tired, we chose to stay here for the night.
We’re very glad we did! Check in staff were lovely. Very helpful and friendly. Room was great, spotlessly clean, comfortable with a great shower.
The bar was open all night so we were able to get a nightcap. The decor was inspired, and the breakfast the following morning was wonderful with lots of choice available.
We had some noise all night coming from the bathroom (the extractor fan I think), but being so tired we slept through it eventually.  I understand this is a known issue and is being resolved though.
The location next to the terminal is great, and I will definitely stay here again if we have an early/late flight.

BUT very noisy room :  no sleep!","We paid around £80  for a room at this hotel it's a short walk across to the airport so it was really convenient. We were allocated room 8 ground floor and I checked with the receptionist to make sure it was definitely a quiet room  as our alarm was set for 4.30 am the next morning. ....the triple glazing was excellent we couldn't hear any outside noise at all .....BUT when we got to bed we could hear a loud clicking noise and whirring which seemed to be coming from the ceiling area above the door  we turned the air con off  but that noise continued all night and by 2.30 am I was so tired and annoyed as we couldn't sleep  I rang reception and explained about the noise-  she said she would  turn off the aircon remotely -(but it wasn't on )  ....the noise continued all night.  When I got to reception around 5 am I explained we couldn't sleep at all due to that noise in our room and I suggested an engineer sort it asap for the next occupiers- we really wasted our money staying here and probably won't stay again.    Another issue but nowhere near as annoying ..... after a very early morning shower we realised there were no bath towels we managed with the 2 small hand towels  and we mentioned this to the receptionist as we checked out at 5.30 am she said .... I've got some here if you want them .  . . .

Alarms were set for 4am.

The rooms are lovely, the restaurant menu is very very basic, with little option, but good food.

The problems happened when I went to bed. (I had a room on the first floor)
Between 10pm and 4am, the room clanked, clunked, whistled and rattled.
I was woken up pretty much every hour between 11pm and 4am due to the noise of what I can only guess what the heating.

I’ve never had such a poor nights sleep at a hotel.

In the morning, I cane down for a continental breakfast (only option at 4:30am, which is fair enough) and my friend said she had exactly the same issue.

When you are staying at an airport hotel with the aim of getting a good nights sleep before a very early flight, you expect to be able to sleep.

Please Hamptons, sort this out. It’s a lovely hotel in a great location, but the noise is horrendous.

We had a meal in the bar which was lovely - daughter had a tuna sandwich, husband had the burger and chips which he absolutely loved, and I had a tomato and mozzarella salad with a bowl of chips. Prices were reasonable for a hotel and they had lots of snacks and essentials to buy if you needed it. 
I can’t comment on breakfast as we left the hotel at 5 for the 5minute walk to the airport, but continental was available at that time.

One hint - you get 1 hr free parking at the hotel which means you don’t have to drag your luggage across the car park, plenty of time to check in and make a drink after a long journey!

Joke!!","If you are disabled and travelling, as we know this is can be a difficult task! Myself and my son was travelling to Cardiff to watch boxing. He is the wheelchair user everyday!. I booked a queen size with mobility Access! I think if I'm being honest the guy who checked me in saw I didn't have a wheelchair and stuck is in a normal  room with minimal access!  Bathroom not accesible like the pictures feel disappointed that such a hotel brand can make serious mistakes like this! I didn't have time to make a fuss as we where on a strict time scale watching a major event! To come back to find a small double room if that wheelchair had to drive to the furthest room on 1st floor( no idea why, glad there wasn't a fire?) All.in all if you are a disabled user I wouldn't recommend staying at this place! Same old same old story I'll add some pictures of laughable queen size room and the accesible bathroom! If you wish to take the time to see the pictures on there website there nothing like what is in reality very very disappointed overall would never stay again disabled travellers beware please don't get caught short! By what I can only describe as poor poor customer service as I don't have the wheelchair present at check In! Car park charges are horrendous too which I'm sure wasn't stated when booking £8p/h or 16.50 for 24 if you have the pleasure of staying that long!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/1d/2a/4b/ta-img-20171029-105048.jpg

I thought parking was in the airport long stay but the hotel does have its own car park. It can be quite a hike from the long stay so even though the Hampton parking is expensive, the convenience might make it worthwhile.

Nice touch having breakfast starting at 4:00.

This resulted in a trek in the rain across several car parks and roads. However, my departure was simple out the rear of the hotel through a covered walk way and then up the steps/ramp from the short stay car park. The hotel is new and fresh and the room was comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was included in the room price and one of the reasons for booking the room was the promise of a continental breakfast starting at 4 am which fitted with the early check ins for EasyJet flights.  On entering the breakfast area at 4, there was no sign of any breakfast just many people waiting around so I went to the airport for coffee and croissants with security and check in completed. One thing I must mention is the Caesar salad I ordered from the bar shortly after arrival.  It consisted of a bowl with a thick layer of croutons on the bottom, some shredded lettuce on top and then some grated cheese.  On top of this were strips of tasteless chicken with the texture of rubber so I definitely cannot recommend the food! Still for me being on site and so close to the terminal building was the biggest bonus of this hotel.  I can certainly recommend it for sleep comfort but not for the food.","1","","2017-10-31","2017-10-26","2017-10-26","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r536197141-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Room good although disappointing that I couldn’t open bedroom window, very stuffy.

The food in the evening was appalling. Beefburger was so over cooked and dry I could have used it to patch my shoe. Chips were either cooked in old oil or had been cooked previously and refried. When I spoke to the waitress she said what do you want me to do about it, they are all the same!  She then said she would ask her supervisor to come over.  He or she couldn’t be bothered.  Compare this to the food at the Holiday Inn, Bristol Airport and very much lacking.

However the continental breakfast at 4am was a big improvement on my last visit.

Room 166 was fresh and clean and bedding all good. My first problem was the noise from AC or plumbing in the roofspace outside the toilet door. I thought of asking to be moved but at 1130pm, I couldn't be bothered. I regret that. During the night I discovered that the worst noise would come from vehicles...buses I think idling on an exit ramp outside. The hotel room was well-insulated for sound, but somehow the rumble penetrates to shake the bed. 

None of this was the fault of the very pleasant hotel staff, but whatever short-sighted crew thought it a good idea to put bedrooms so close to a road. 

I'd  consider staying here again, but only if I could get a room on a quiet side of the hotel.

The receptionist did waive my charge for a glass of beer when I reported the noise, but £109 for a disturbed sleep is still about £109 too much.

I booked on booking.com but the hotel had no record of the booking - and I overheard the exact same thing happening to the next person checking in.  Luckily they had accommodation and they recommended one room rather than two for our overnight accommodation for my wife, two children (one teenager) and myself.  Free breakfast (a substantial all-you-can-eat with classic cooked breakfast stuff), and free wifi.  All for £139 which is good for 4 people.

Dinner menu is very limited, but food was fine, and reasonably priced.  On 1st night, I received a free dinner - here's why:  At 8pm, I ordered a salmon for myself and a burger for my son, along with two waters. Waitress came to table at 8:35 pm to explain they did no have salmon.  I was surprised to say the least - at that point a salmon should be cooked an served. But in fairness, the waitress gave me a free burger instead. Food and drinks arrived together, at 8 53pm.
On the second night, all four of us ate there.  I was thinking the dinner might take a long time again to serve, so we ordered well ahead of when we needed to eat.  But it all came out within 10 mins (perfect).

Anyway, fine place to stay.  Perhaps they are having teething with some organisation things (the place looks new).

The check in lady was very friendly and helpful when we arrived late evening. 
Our room was really clean and comfortable, with a nice bathroom. 
We had a drink and a burger in the restaurant. They don’t have a huge selection of food on the menu, but it was ok. 
We slept amazingly well, I woke up refreshed at 4am! I have never had a good sleep at an airport hotel before. The bed was so comfortable and the room was nice and quiet.

Me and my boyfriend stayed here for one night due to our early flight to Mexico. £99 for 2 people including a breakfast of continental and full English buffet. 

We were in room one on the ground floor. This was very easy and quick to get too and right opposite the gym which was very handy for me, 

The whole place including the room was very clean and decorated lovely. The staff were also very nice and helpful. We had our evening meal here too which was very large and good value for money. The breakfast was also very good. 

I did find the room very cold though :(

Expensive car park so we had already purchased car parking in the airport long stay car park. On arrival they had a single receptionist working front of house so it delayed check -in. They serve a continental breakfast from 4am which was perfectly fine however there is no restaurant at this hotel and you take your food back into the bar / reception area to eat.

Bar and restaurant area were standard but good and breakfast very good. I will certainly stay again. A word of warning, I arrived in my car which I'd pre-booked into long stay car park. I entered Hilton via barrier to drop off bags and exited Hilton before entering main car park to park car. On collection of car post holiday the exit barrier didn't open and I had to go the the staff attendant to sort out. I was not alone, it appears that if you have pre-booked and enter Hilton barriers first, your Hiltonexit cancels out the long stay booking as they are on the same system. They resolved it quickly but seems to be something they need to address.","1","","2017-10-31","2017-10-10","2017-10-10","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r531710449-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

You would not know you were at an airport. Location is 5 minutes from the departure building - so really good if you have an early flight.

So all good. But for heavens sake why the dreadful food? The food 'eating area' (its not a restaurant) is downstairs - order at the bar. Its a canteen approach. And our offering was burger, pizza or curry. We had the burger at @ £11 - frozen & really bad.  So for 2 with a glass of wine each it was over £30!

We do not want a gourmet meal, but this It would stop us returning.

We were allocated room 4 which is on the ground floor.
The room was very comfortable with all the usual extras expected of such a hotel.
However, our sleep was interrupted several times by what we think was the extractor fan from the bathroom in room 3. This was almost a severe vibration in the wall, and as we were looking forward to a good night's sleep due to the early rise, it was very annoying.
I also noticed that the emergency cord in the bathroom, which is supposed to be free of obstruction and almost touching the floor (to enable a collapsed person to reach it), was in fact tied up around towel/radiator bars, and was about 2 feet above the floor - well out of the reach of any collapsed person. I untied this, but I am sure that it would be tied up again quite soon, as cleaning staff find it tends to get in their way. But their annoyance should be secondary to the Health & Safety of guests.
Otherwise, the hotel was very good, and if the neighbourly vibrations could be eliminated then I would recommend others to stay there. But until then - only book if you intend getting to sleep after your neighbours get to bed","1","","2017-10-31","2017-10-10","2017-10-10","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r531605432-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel very well presented and clean, greeted by reception staff who were all full of smiles. Due to me being in wheel chair didn’t make me fill awkward or out of place. 
Given an easy accessible room on the ground floor.
The room was very clean and well presented with tea and coffee making facilities.
Being that this hotels based within the grounds of Bristol International Airport thought there may have been a issue with noise, but no I was wrong slept very peacefully. 
Snacks are available at location both of us had beef burger and chips very nice hit the spot.
Awoke went through for full English breakfast although the variety was there should you require anything different.
Car parking at location is good but at a premium £16.50 for one night. 
If anything could not fault location or staff, although one niggle was a guest/hanger on at the reception bar location who was constant try to obtain cigarettes from guest. At first didn’t mind but on return he was still there and still trying to obtain cigarettes. Whether it’s because they don’t sale cigarettes or he just wanted to test people he did on a few occasions offer to buy one.

Check in was a bit slow but was friendly and the manager explained a little about the hotel i.e. that it was constructed from old ship 'containers'. So when we were shown to our room we weren't expecting it to be as lovely as it was .... it was small but very comfortable with a delightful walk in shower and a lovely bed. We were supplied with extra pillows on request. It overlooked the airport but we were not troubled by any noise. 

We had three disappointments the first was in the public areas; lounge, restaurant etc. There was nowhere comfortable to sit and relax with a pre-dinner drink except for a very few lounge chairs (all occupied) beside the front entrance. Everything else was a bit like a motorway services, modern, sparse and a bit chilly with a too enthusiastic use of air-conditioning. 

The second disappointment was with the food; there was nothing on the menu that was attractive to us and what we did order was just about OK but certainly not to the standard that we expected. What a shame; anyone going on holiday is in a good mood and ready to celebrate the start of the event. It would have been nice to have the choice of something a bit more up-market by way of food and venue. 

The third problem was that it is quite a long uphill walk to the actual airport. We are not young and we had 2 suitcases each so it was a bit of a struggle. Also had it been raining (and we were going to a hot dry country so had no waterproofs with us) it could have been disastrous. I think a covered level walkway accessed from roof level and accessible by lift is essential. This difficulty of access means that it is unlikely we will return to the Hampton by Hilton at Bristol because it is easier to stay at a more distant hotel with a shuttle service to the airport doors. 

I think for anyone who wants low prices and doesn't mind fast food and a longish walk to the airport the hotel is a good choice as the rooms are very good but for oldies like us I believe there are better options. 

The hotel is very new so perhaps things will improve.","3","","2017-09-30","2017-10-02","2017-10-02","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r528930270-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

I was desperate and had just decided to get up, dress, and go down to reception when it stopped.  The same thing woke me several times in the night.

I made a strong complaint to the reception desk when I checked out and was just told “You should have rung down and asked for a change of room” hardly a practical suggestion to dress, repack, and move!!

The hotel is modern, clean and tidy. 
First stay was ok, although we found it strange that they would situate a restaurant in the lobby area. Second stay has been awful. We arrived and were allocated our room. As we entered our room we noticed shoes and a bag on the floor..........yes we had just been given access to another guests room. We immediately went down to reception and explained what had happened and were told ‘the computer shouldn’t let them do that’. I understand computer glitches happen therefore we let that go. We went down to eat and although the menu only seems to have around four options we decided to have salmon. Well......the salmon was awful, It was hard and the beans were undercooked and cold. I explained this to the restaurant manager who within 10 minutes had arranged a replacement meal so again I let this go. Finally after our ‘meal’ we went to our room as we had an early flight to catch and as we went to enter our room the key would not work. After my husband went back down to reception they advised him that he had been ‘checked out’. At this point we had had enough. Never will I stay at this shambles of a hotel again. It is by far the worst. I would recommend the holiday inn if you would like to stay near the airport.

Easy access from Bristol temple meads station there is a regularly bus service close to the hotel  for those travelling by train.  There is also parking for those travelling by car. The only disappointment was that the hotel does not have a proper restaurant. There is a bar and a very limited choice ( 5 or 6 choices} of bar meals in the evenings just burgers and chips that sort of thing. There is a good choice  at breakfast if you have time . We had a very early flight. We would definitely stay here again","0","","2017-09-30","2017-09-30","2017-09-30","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r528507720-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Awful breakfast.","For couples, the price is expensive but not overly but Hilton seem to be penalising single travellers by not having a single rate and not even having single rooms available. This puts up the price to businesses who are sending staff abroad too.
The room was fine but there was a constant noise from the water supply in the bathroom and it was impossible to sleep because the a/c was coming on and going off all the time and was noisy too (cheap unit I expect). I turned it off but it might be a problem in the summer.
Evening meal - little choice and not that nice. I was overcharged for my drink. 
Breakfast - is free but you certainly would know it. It was just like going to a cheap hotel 20 years ago; scrambled eggs which tasted like they were made from a powdered egg, dry bacon, everything only luke warm. If I had been paying £40 a night I might not have minded but £98 for a single person is a joke quite frankly.","1","","2017-09-30","2017-09-26","2017-09-25","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r527479242-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Right next to the airport but we didn't hear a single noise from the planes all of the time we were there!
Check in good, we were early but they still had a room available. Staff were friendly and advised us where or more importantly where not to go to eat! In the end we stayed at the hotel, dinner was fine and prices reasonable. Breakfast next day was very good with a decent choice, we enjoyed it! 
Hotel is typical Hampton, you know what you're going to get and this one didn't disappoint. Lovely clean room, good air con, comfy beds and a good bathroom.
Only issue for us was that we felt a bit stuck there as we didn't want to drive out again and were warned how expensive taxi's are so we decided to stay put. Parking, while right outside and plentiful was an extortionate £16. I believe it's owned and managed by the airport but surely Hampton could have negotiated a better deal???

I've stayed at this hotel a few times before a flight the following day

It's okay for a transit stop, food and drinks available by the most unwelcoming staff I've ever seen in my whole life, experienced on a few occasions 

Don't get me wrong people the foreign staff from overseas have always been 10/10! men and women, and male uk staff! but the local UK women were the most unfriendliest ever!! When I stayed there last week one of the local reception/bar staff were literally arguing in front of my face when I was trying to get checked in...and then gossiping to other staff how the other ones not working and sitting around bla bla in front of my face when I was at the bar

Check out this morning again by an overseas young lady, pleasant and sweet whereas local girls chatting away at Main reception and discussing personal circumstances with the most disgusting fed up looks, no smiles nothing 

I've got names but would save them for now but clear up your act girls, if you don't like your job and can't show respect towards clients then do something else, the managers need to look into this.

Otherwise rooms nice and clean, food basic, good for stopover.","2","","2017-09-30","2017-09-20","2017-09-20","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r526043836-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

","We stayed here after a long travel from abroad and arrived at 2am extremely tired, check in was welcoming, quick. Our room was lovely with everything we needed and cleaned to a very high standard. The breakfast was lovely and check out was easy and quick. I would love to rate 5* but in our room some kind of water or a boiler would kick in nearly every half hour/hour which woke us up followed by a bang, we tried to figure out what it was but being so tired we just wanted to sleep, maybe it's the pipes in the wall or the air con? 
This won't stop us from staying again but we may stay clear of that room.

I arrived at 2am for a flight at 6 *sigh* and upon check in, the staff where polite and efficient in getting everything sorted quickly.  

The hotel lobby is clean and modern and the room does what it needs, mine was clean and light.  

I did not use the restaurant / bar which would have been interesting as this is where the hotel seems to have let itself down.

For reference, the hotel is about 2 minutes from the airport entrance (walking). 

Overall, I have no faults here. I received an on time wake up call and enjoyed a short but enjoyable stay.","1","","2017-08-31","2017-09-10","2017-09-09","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r523005263-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We had an early flight and arrived at the hotel late afternoon. Strangely it does not have a ‘proper’ restaurant, this may be alright in a city centre but in the isolation of Bristol Airport there is very little alternative to the limited and expensive bar snacks. Compared to hotels at other airports we found this one on the expensive side and the public areas very functional and clinical. OK for one night. You can leave your car at the hotel but at an extortionate price but you can park for one hour free which is handy to drop of bags then go and park somewhere cheaper like Silverline.","1","","2017-08-31","2017-09-09","2017-09-09","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r522925957-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is new and very clean.. rooms are spacious and bathrooms modern. All the staff were polite and helpful even at 3.45 in the morning when we left. Breakfast is available from 4am we didn't make use of this as we needed to leave just before. Walking distance to the terminal and like others have said it's cheaper to book the car into airport parking for an extra night than paying for a nights parking at the hotel. We found it cheaper to book Bristol airport parking and the hotel separate. The deal on Bristol airport for parking and hotel together worked out more expensive. 

The restaurant is an open space- we didn't eat at the hotel but seemed a good choice. The toiletries in the bathroom were good. 

A great hotel, great price and great for early Bristol flights.

This is literally a 2 minute walk to the actual airport so a perfect location. The only one thing that was a bit frustrating was how noisy the air con was - very noisy, however would not put us off staying again, we are definitely looking forward to returning here.","0","","2017-08-31","2017-08-21","2017-08-21","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r515994566-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

This is definitely the place to go for pre-flight, post-flight drinks and food, business meetings and a comfortable night before an early flight. 

Unfortunately I believe some of the young staff to be in need of some further training. When approaching the reception area to ask for some food, I was advised that the young lady had not yet started her shift yet despite being in her uniform and chatting with other staff!

She was also drinking from a personal plastic drink bottle behind the counter which was far from professional. 

When food arrived there were no instructions given as to where we could find condiments, Napkins etc.  

Another member of staff was carrying food to another table and asked what food we were waiting for as they weren't sure whose food was waiting at the service point, which was worrying and also unprofessional as it was far from busy. 

Once we had eaten, one of the staff cleared one plate from the table whilst other members was still eating which is not what I would expect. 

One other point just to mention generally is that the hair of one of the girls was most untidy, hanging down from a pony tail and not looking smart at all. I appreciate that this hotel has yet to become busy and it certainly wasn't busy when we were there, but the level of professionalism and service needs to be upheld at all times and a work environment maintained . 

I hope that this constructive observation will assist with building what undoubtedly has the potential to be, a very popular stop off when visiting the airport or arranging business meetings. 

Looking forward to visiting again when next I fly from Bristol Airport!

However - the restaurant is dreadful, very limited menu (they're missing a trick here as there's no choice of eating venue at the airport) and decor is geared towards appearance rather than functionality. There are huge light shades which aren't lined up with the tables and hang very low, so although none of my party were over 5ft 5 we all hit our heads on them. The food is served on fancy wooden boards so slippery that my chips slid off onto the table and had to be replaced. Then we had to send back two chicken burgers which were raw in the middle and the replacements took over 40 minutes to arrive. Prices at the bar were extortionate. 
Once in our rooms all four of us discovered that the extractor fans in the rooms randomly switch themselves on periodically through the night - sounding like a freight train coming through the room. Hardly got any sleep!
To finish it off, car park prices were astronomical, it would probably have been cheaper to park in the airport car park. 
Definitely not an experience I wish to repeat any time soon. ","4","","2017-08-31","2017-08-16","2017-08-15","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r513540800-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

","We had read peoples comments that it could take up to an hour to get served food here, so we looked for somewhere else to eat but didn't fancy the Bungalow Family Fun Pub close by so decided to give it a try. 
We ordered a Caprese salad and mains of Salmon fillet potatoes and green beans.  
The salad arrived quickly and we were fooled into thinking that the hotel had remedied the slow service many had reported. 45 mins after our order had been placed left us without food and famished. We asked a waiter if he could help and within minutes our meals were served. Not sure how long they had been ready but the salmon was greasy and overcooked the beans were very undercooked and so we had a meal of potatoes costing £11.95 each. It was the worst meal in any hotel we have stayed in.

Service: 3","Ideal airport hotel","Overall a good hotel, new so everywhere looks fresh & in good order. Had one issue which really did blight the experience. Waited nearly 15 mins at the bar for service and the only person standing there!!

Was flying out at 0630 hrs Monday morning and didn't want to travel on the day so this seemed worth giving a try having stayed in several of the hotels in the surrounding area. It's not clear from the hotel web page but if you are parking in long stay then head for zones G or F which is closest to the hotel NB it is cheaper to add an extra day to your airport parking than book via the hotel which even as a guest you pay £16 for overnight parking. We parked in zone C and walked to the hotel having ascended to the main road, did quite a dog leg because we missed the ramp down to the hotel because the sign is set well back off the road. It became clear when we checked in that we had missed the ramp as we were told by the person checking us in and pointed to a different entrance to the one we had used. Logged into the free WiFi quickly and easily and there was good coverage throughout the hotel - was able to stream short video clips with no problem.

Check in was quick and easy - we did arrive prior to check in time and had to wait but we simply had a beer and a snack. Luggage was left in a secure room. 

Nice sized room, if there was one thing I would say it is the only double bed is a queen size no king sized! Nice bathroom with a shower, soap, conditioner & body lotion in dispensers. TV is a little on the small side but given its a hotel people are usually transiting through not too much of an issue. Everywhere spotlessly clean as you would expect in such a new hotel and the challenge will be maintaining this standard.

Had both a snack and a dinner, it's fairly ordinary food but all of it was cooked and served very well. Had a few beers too and as mentioned above the only downside to the otherwise excellent service was when there was a change of staff - night shift coming on when it took a nose dive. The bar forms one limb of an L shape and check in desk the other limb of the L and I was standing at the angle in clear sight of the desk. Despite standing there a good time neither of the staff came to check if I wanted anything especially as my partner left the bar leaving me there so clearly wanting something???? I made the decision not to have another drink and made my feelings known as I left to the two staff standing at the check-in desk. It's a shame because this incident really distracted from our otherwise really good stay.

Breakfast was included in the price which given the time of our check out there was a continental breakfast only. Must admit struggled with this, very little ham available or cheese, would have thought there would have been some boiled eggs available which I have had in several hotels with a continental option. Very little cutlery around despite searching and looking in the empty holders under the counters. There was quick porridge available and I assume you either have to ask for hot water or use the beverage machine and hope you get the volume of water right. 

Check out was quick no problems at all and within an easy 5 minute walk we were in the airport terminal.","4","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/19/4e/b8/tv-and-workstation.jpg

This perfectly located hotel is situated directly opposite the airport terminal building and has ample parking for guests. 

Rooms are clean, modern and spacious with a reasonable sized bathroom and excellent amenities. The double bed was particularly comfortable as were the pillows.

The bar/restaurant area is large and offers a wide selection of beverages at a reasonable price. The menu is limited but the meals served were delicious and generously sized and included dishes such as burger and chips, freshly prepared pizzas, jacket potatoes and a weekly curry. They also offer a daily special.

Sleep Quality: 4","Very Good Airport Hotel","Only opened in February 2017 and everything is really new. Staff tell me the whole thing was imported in segments from China. It is a little quirky but overall a really good experience. The entrance and reception is enormous and a large part of it is a small bar and huge dining area. The food was OK but no more or less than you would expect. Staff very fireendly and efficient.

When you enter the room, it looks very spartan, but it is well finished, and quite frankly has everything you need including free and quick wifi,a nice lounger for watching TV, and an ample desk for work. Only adverse comment was the aircon was a bit noisy. Strange for a new place.

It is 3-4 minutes easy walk from Airport and 2 minutes to car rentals. Do not make the mistake I made. Arrived evening and picked up car right away - I did not need it until the morning. Result - you are liable for a £16.50 overnight parking charge - total rip off. The car park is owned and run by Bristol Airport, not the hotel, and they managed to get it reduced from an initial £28. The pay station tried to charge me £28, and I needed help from the hotel to call them to get the correct price. So watch out for that. .Needless to say, the car park had few cars in it. Totally outrageous price for a regional airport and I have emailed Bristol Airport to express my view.

Would thoroughly recommend the hotel for an overnight stopover and will stay here again","1","","2017-07-31","2017-07-22","2017-07-22","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r504416383-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Food in bar poor and little choice but does the job if you have a choice though I'd go somewhere else, having said that there is no choice at the airport. . Unusual system of charging money per person to your credit card on arrival incase your room bill turns out more.... He took the room rate then a further £25 each person to spend at the hotel??? Pre authorised money, not sure why but as we didn't spend the full £50  when we checked out they put it back on the card. Breakfast was great plenty of choice and not crowded and plenty of it.

Unfortunately, the hotel has substituted coffee altogether since the liquid dispensed at breakfast under the name of coffee was totally undrinkable.  Speaking of the breakfast, another  failure was porridge which was provided as powder in plastic containers which you are to pour hot water in, stir, and contemplate the result. I do not advice to move beyond contemplation to tasting, it is inedible. Generally I am not picky at all, and the standard breakfast fare by Hampton Inn leaves me completely satisfied. I understand this is not a Michelin restaurant and the food comes prefabricated, but nevertheless they must not fail such basic  things as coffee and porridge. Nevertheless the other breakfast items (scranbled eggs, bacon, bakery, etc.) were ok.

Another major drawback of this hotel  is room ventilation. The windows are shut tight and the handles are removed (I stayed for 4 nights in July). Air is to be provided by the built-in AC unit which tries to fulfill the purpose by snapping and clicking in the middle of the night, even if it is switched off. Apart from waking you up, not much is achieved. I prefer to be able to just open the window. In addition to better customer satisfaction, it would save the hotel the costs of running the system.

In all other aspects the hotel is very good. The room was spacious enough, clean and quiet (no aircraft noise at all). WiFi was ok. There are a lot of power outlets in the room (all are of the British standard) and there is a USB port in the alarm clock to charge a phone or whatever. I did not have time to try hotel's restaurant in the evenings but M&S Food store in the airport terminal suited me just fine.

Despite the shortcomings I would stay here again.","2","","2017-07-31","2017-07-19","2017-07-19","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r503540239-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is clean, the staff are friendly, rooms are ok, bed is nowhere near as comfortable as a Premier Inn bed and they charge double the price of a Premier Inn.  The worst part was the restaurant.  Again, the staff were lovely, but there simply aren't enough of them.  There are probably 40 tables and there was just one person serving.  We waited 40 minutes for food and when we complained to the manager, he could only respond by asking us if we were familiar with ""The Hampton Concept?!""   If ""The Hampton Concept"" is to overcharge for an average hotel room and to be completely understaffed and be happy for guests to wait 40 minutes for over priced food, then yes, we are aware of that concept.   In future, we would catch an overnight Megabus to the airport prior to an early morning flight rather than pay good money to stay here.

Very quiet in room considering proximity to airport.
Breakfast was more than adequate with everything self service. Only drawback on morning of my visit was a child playing football in seating/food area and no member of staff available to request parental intervention.

Service: 3","Holiday airport stayover","At last a long awaited airport hotel at Bristol.  Booked online through Booking.com although not the cheapest option the vicinity to the airport we thought would be the best choice for a nice chilled stay over before a flight the next day. 
Parking: I hadn't realised before booking that parking in this hotel is not free ! £16 for one night is a total rip off and if I had the option to cancel the booking I would have done so and stayed else where.
Check in: Relatively painless although I felt the staff member could have done with more training in customer services as we didn't feel we got a warm welcome and she didn't seem to know what she was doing when checking in.
Rooms:  Standard rooms, clean and tidy with good bathroom facilities. Noiseless from the flights landing and taking off.  Didn't really require the AC to be on even though it was a warm summers night while sleeping.  On to what we hoped would be a refreshing sleep before our flight in a really comfortable bed. During the night we were woken by what I assume was the AC making a gurgling/whining noise (although not switched on). Slept again, and 2 hours later happened again, 2 hours later happen again ! This really needs to be sorted out as I noticed this happened in other reviews. 
Bar/Food: Had a couple of drinks in the bar (reasonably priced for the location).  The food menu is really limited and the hotel is really missing out on a trick here.  We would have eaten here too if there had been a little more choice.
Breakfast: We thought breakfast was really tasty, good choices from fruit to full English, coffee to a good range of teas. 
Checkout: Quick but again training on customer services could be improved, not a single smile or courtesy of asking how our stay was (there was no one waiting and she didn't seem in a rush) and this would have been a nice touch and she seemed a little annoyed when asked to validate my parking to get the cheaper rate on leaving.
Overall: Probably wouldn't stay here again, despite it's location to the airport and good breakfast, cheaper parking and a good nights sleep is important combined with improvement in customer service or at least a smile (fake or genuine) from reception.","2","","2017-06-30","2017-07-11","2017-07-11","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r500701585-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

They replaced the food while I was queuing and there was enough to serve the 5 people in the queue in front of me and then everything was empty again. It wasn't that busy and breakfast was prebooked so they knew catering numbers. It didn't seem that this was a one off as there was no apology.

Reception was quick and efficient. The room was basic but appeared to have all the necessary items for a one night stay. On closer inspection the toilet seat was not secure and a drawer in the beside cabinet would not close.
When using the shower we found that a shower/bath mat was missing and the shower did not drain efficiently.   
These items were mentioned a checkout and a small reduction in the bill was secured.      
Breakfast had plenty of choice, however the coffee was obtained from automatic dispensers and failed our flavour test.
Overall, a basic hotel, not cheap, trying its best but needs to ensure that housekeeping reports room defects and that these are acted on.   This is a new hotel and is already showing scuff marks on the walls.

Sleep Quality: 2","Brand new facility close to airport but inconvenient access and noisy bedroom AC","I used this property for 2 nights whilst visiting colleagues in the South West of UK. Access to and from the terminal, although nearby and a short walk is inconvenient for those with heavy bags since it involves either negotiating four flights of steps or taking a meandering ramp which adds about 300m to the walk. Having enquired the night before departing as to whether there would be anyone available in the morning to assist me with my heavy and bulky luggage on departure the following morning I was assured there would be. In fact on checking out early the next morning I was told that only 2 reception staff were on duty and both were busy, so sorry - no assistance available.

The hotel itself is brand new, clean and tidy and with entirely adequate facilities including a well equipped gym, all of which I enjoyed. However the sleep quality was marred by a very noisy AC in the bedroom which could not be set to anything above 25C and which never turned off automatically even at that high temperature setting. The only alternative was to manually switch it off.","1","","2017-06-30","2017-06-23","2017-06-22","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r495277644-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

+ Very modern hotel, looks clean and has that shiny, brand new look, smell and feel
+ Friendly staff upon check-in and quite a few of them available
+ Very close to terminal
+ Strong, powerful air-con
+ Outstanding free wi-fi: Download: 86 Mbps and Upload: 86 Mbps
+ Well double-glazed windows - no obvious aircraft noise (or any noise)
+ Very firm mattress
+ Breakfast starts at 4am!

Dislikes:
- Didn't spot much signage from the various car-parks around the hotel to the hotel itself.
- I wasn't sure how parking was supposed to operate; the Hilton website said that ""Parking at the Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport is provided by the Airport and can be reserved in advance."" Now did this mean I should use the Airport Parking website or the Hotel's website? In the end I chose the Bristol Airport Parking website and ended up paying almost £60 for what was a one and a half day stay! So I probably did not do the right thing so please check before you end up making the same mistake.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/a3/94/82/wi-fi.jpg","2017-06-30","2017-06-21","2017-06-21","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r494858256-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

It is located a few minutes walk from the terminal and there is a slope only route to and from the terminal, with a shorter route offering only a few steps. Despite the location there was almost no evidence of aircraft related noise. The rooms are modern and well equipped and the beds are comfortable. The hotel is quiet - an important factor if you want to turn in early. The two stand out ideas were breakfast and general dining. A continental breakfast is available from 04.00 hours and provided an excellent choice and speedy self service. The general dining is simple but allows for a limited choice pub grub type meal, with swift service. No fuss no bother the hotel recognises that you are only passing through and not here to stay for any length of time at the hotel.

Sleep Quality: 5","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport - A Great Place to Stay...BUT...","We were visiting friends in Bristol and decided to stay here for four nights. Being a Hilton Honours member I got a good deal, so felt it was a good place to stay.

The hotel is brand new and in a good location to visit our friends who live in Backwell, close to the airport.

When we arrived we were greeted very warmly by the young lady behind reception. We were quickly checked in and we located our room.

The room was a great room which was lovely and clean and comfortable. The bed and pillows were really comfortable. There was a lovely bathroom with a great walk in shower and an abundance of great toiletries.

We quickly found out that it was a struggle to keep the room nice and warm even though the temperature outside was quite warm.  One downside to the room was the fact that there were only 6 coat hangers. We were here for four nights so had a lot of clothes to hang up. It looks like the rooms are only geared up for people flying away on holiday.

We decided to have a snack in the bar only to find that the menu was limited, so we had to walk up to the airport terminal building to get a snack. There is an M&S food shop so we were spoilt for choice. The hotel should offer a better menu to stop people like us looking for a better choice somewhere else. The hotel is missing a trick there!

The wifi in the room was good and the breakfast area is great with a good selection of hot and cold breakfast items. Whilst we were having breakfast the lady was working really hard to ensure that all the breakfast items were topped up for customers. She was also very friendly. 

We really enjoyed our breakfast.

We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel...but... the car parking situation is a fiasco!

As a Hilton Honours member I object to paying £16.50 per night to park my car. I was advised to park in the airport's long stay car park at a lower cost but why should I have to walk a distance every time I wanted to use my car to drive to meet our friends. I wanted to park it right outside the hotel. On top of that the ticketing for the car park is a joke. I was told that the car park is operated by Bristol Airport car parking and that they dictate to the hotel how cars can be parked. I had to get my new car park ticket validated every day by the hotel otherwise I would have had to pay £28 every day to access the car park and park my car. For the four nights that I stayed at the hotel my car was only parked there 8 hours every night because we were out and about in my car around Bristol with our friends during the day. Therefore it wasn't taking up a car parking space during the day. 

So I had to basically pay £16.50 every night to park my car in a hotel where I have a loyalty membership. On top of that and to add insult to injury, if you pay by credit card, they whack you with another 2.5%! Unbelievable! I find this extremely disappointing and if Hilton don't get a grip on this, they will lose valuable HH members to other competitive hotel brands close to the airport. 

When Hilton decided to build their Hampton Inn on this site why didn't they negotiate to purchase the rights to the car park when the deal was done? They would then be able to provide multi-night stay customers with a competitive and hassle free car parking experience. Hilton have now got a massive 'anchor' on this site now and will find it difficult to negotiate a better deal with Bristol Airport authority for car parking.

This car parking fiasco needs to be sorted by Hilton ASAP or they will lose valuable customers.

It's a great place to stay...But!","3","","2017-06-30","2017-06-16","2017-06-16","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r493591461-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Meal arrived in a matter of minutes which led me to believe it had been kept warm for a few hours or was nuked in a micro wave. The latter seemed to be the case.

We ate in the restaurant on a Saturday night and the choice and quality of food was pretty good. The evening restaurant and bar staff were friendly and efficient. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of certain members of the hotel reception staff who were on duty during the Saturday afternoon of our arrival - as per a number of previous reviews, their apparent complete lack of customer service skills and indifference / disinterest in relation to hotel guests was almost breathtaking to behold. We would hope, given the number of previous comments re lack of customer service skills / sullen attitude etc of a very small number of front of house staff, that the hotel management would have already identified the ""problem areas"" and that appropriate steps will be taken to address these issues. We are due to visit the hotel again at the end of July - hopefully at that point we can be slightly more positive in our overall comments re the reception staff.

Good news: the room was clean and  quiet, the beds comfortable, the shower good (but for some reason no washcloths). Our check in was friendly and helpful, and the restaurant/bar was nice and reasonably priced. We paid the exorbitant price for the room in order to be at the airport for our early-morning flight.

The hotel is new and the rooms are spacious, very comfortable and surprisingly quiet, no noise at all. Staff are very friendly
If you stay overnight at this hotel and want dinner you are restricted to the hotel restaurant as the airport only has coffee bars open and nothing else in the area. Unfortunately the hotel seems to have a recurring problem of very long waits for your meals,(1 hour and 5 minutes), they seem to be understaffed and this is noticeable at breakfast as well.

One major drawback to using this hotel as an overnight stop unless you are flying is the very expensive overnight parking fee of £16.50. This is the dearest hotel self-parking I have come across.

Would stop at this hotel again if flying from Bristol but would have my evening meal on the way to the airport.","0","","2017-05-31","2017-05-30","2017-05-30","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r488974982-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The menu is small, and when we ate the restaurant was quite quiet, but we still had to wait over an hour for our food - with not so much as an apology. 

It's basically a Wetherspoon's menu (deep fried or microwaved) at half the quality and twice the price. Avoid. 

Would have had a better meal by walking to the airport and getting a Subway.

The hotel is clean as you would expect from a new build. It is very convenient to the airport with only a short walk to the departure / check in. If you are driving I would recommend including your hotel stay car parking in the airport site as the hotel carpark for one night is very expensive. The signage for the hotel needs to be improved from the airport carpark although the hotel is an obvious sight from the car park getting there through the large parking area isn't as obvious. The bar prices for food and drink are ridiculous and the food is of poor quality for the cost, we had two drinks and two burgers with fries and this came to just over £30, The burgers were very dry and tasteless as were the fries. Our morning flight was early and we therefore could only take advantage of the limited breakfast on offer at 4am. This however was very disappointing, we only had coffee and even this had to be without milk as neither of the two machines had any, this was also raised by many other guests present ! Very poor indeed considering we were some of the first people to breakfast so they certainly had not run out, simply a case of very poor preparation on the hotels part. We paid £100 for the night and it was far short of what we have become used to from Hilton after staying on at least 3 occasions at their Exeter airport hotel and being a Hilton honours member. Our room was fine as were the reception staff but other than the hotel's location and convenience we were not overly impressed which is really unfortunate as we are far from the average complainers.

The only downfall for us was we booked via booking.com and not made aware we would need to pay a further £16.50 for parking on arrival as the hotel doesn't actually own the car park yet Goblin Farm only took an extra £5 for the night.

Very easy to make an online (Bristol Airport website) booking for a combined hotel and car park stay.  Not really much to add to previous reviews about this very new hotel (and that had only opened 2 months earlier).  To be able to drive straight to the hotel, book in, go to one's room, dump one's luggage and to then be able to take one's car to whichever car park one had booked and to then return to the hotel without hauling suitcases is a very good and easy arrangement.
Rooms are fine but at first we thought, odd, no coat hanging space (until we found it was hidden behind the loo sliding door!), also odd, no safe (until we found it concealed behind a drawer door!).  
A nice restaurant area, although we did feel the menu for main courses was rather limited.
A few minutes walk, a bit uphill, to the terminal by ramp or steps.  However, the signing of the ramp route needs to be improved, especially from terminal exit down to the hotel.
Overall my wife and I felt Bristol Airport has a winner here with this new hotel, especially for those catching early morning flights.  We have already booked another stay for our next holiday.","3","","2017-04-30","2017-05-19","2017-05-19","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r485611334-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The bed was really comfortable and the rooms are well sound-proofed – a plus point when staying at an airport hotel with guests getting up early. 

I was a little surprised that the hotel didn’t have a proper restaurant. The food on the bar menu wasn’t great to be honest – oven pizza and similar “quick cook” options. You could always walk over to the terminal to find something better to eat but I would personally have expected better quality.

Overall though, I would definitely recommend this hotel as a superior option before travelling.

The Hampton by Hilton certainly delivers.

The hotel is located adjacent to the arrivals entrance of the airport, just down the ramp or some steps. A short walk through a covered area brings you to the rear of the hotel. The front car park is managed by Bristol Airport and therefore changed at their standard short stay rates. I parked my car in the long stay prebooked to save a considerable amount.

I did the check in on the Hilton app, including my room selection. On arrival there was a warm welcome, and my key card issued quickly. The reception area is bright, trendy and clean.

The room was the good standard of nearly every Hampton in the UK. Everything you could think of for a short stay. Hair drier, iron, TV, desk chair and comfortable bed.

The bathroom had a large powerful shower with excellent pressure and temperature. Three dispensers of shampoo, conditioner and body wash are on the wall. The quality seemed more than adequate.

I had a bar meal in the reception/lounge area and it was quick, good value and tasty. I can throughly recommend the pizza, which had a nice tomato stuffed crust.

Breakfast is included and offered from 4am, but as I had an early flight just grabbed a glass of water before heading to the terminal. Everything looked great though and was well stocked.

A great stay, in a great location for the airport.","3","","2017-05-31","2017-05-15","2017-05-14","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r484263405-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The chips were warm and soggy and the coleslaw was preprepared and not very nice.  No worries about dinner we were looking forward to breakfast ... oh dear it faired no better - cheap, tasteless sausages, watery salty bacon and scrambled eggs slightly grey in colour.... the baked beans were good and there was quite a wide selection of food ... but that's it :-( 

We were disappointed - come on Hilton improve your food as it is clear you are using cheap ingredients and poor preparation to maximise your profits.

PS if you are put through to the central booking office somewhere in the USA then they will say that you can park your car free whilst staying overnight at the hotel.  This is not the case.

Service: 5","Hampton by Hilton, Bristol (Airport)","I booked into the Hampton by Hilton, Bristol Airport Hotel late April 2017 seeing as I was down in the Bristol area through work. 

On the whole I was thoroughly impressed with this hotel, staff are polite and courteous and all round the facilities within the hotel are very good, it's all very comfortable from lounge to dining areas and there's even a fully equipped gym available.

The bedroom (Room 143) complete with en suite in which I stayed was very clean, immaculate and smart in presentation (Photos included in my review) albeit it probably a bit basic and Spartan for some people's tastes but this suited me down to the ground as I have a strong dislike for very cluttered and fussy rooms which collect dust easily.

I'm delighted to say that the double bed was really comfortable and more than big enough for a 6' 5' tall guy like myself, full marks for that one!

Appropriate tea and coffee facilities are available within the room and a decent enough sized television with all TV channels, hotel information and tourist attractions. There are plenty of sockets available for any electrical appliances you may need to use and there is also an iron, ironing board and hairdryer provided inside the wardrobe area which you can access via a sliding door.

Continental breakfasts start from 0400 with the cooked 'help yourself' British buffet breakfast with sausages and bacon kicking off from 0600, there's pretty much a good selection of everything for all tastes, so something for everyone.

My only niggle was having to pay for the car parking on the way out. If this could have been incorporated into the final payment made when checking out of the hotel, then this could make life a little easier. I know it's a bit fickle of me to highlight this one small thing and I'm pretty sure I'll not be alone in my way of thinking.

Final summary, Hampton by Hilton, Bristol Airport is a very good hotel, I'd be happy to stay there again in the future and willing to recommend the place to all.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/1a/47/6c/hampton-by-hilton-bristol.jpg

I didn't arrive until after midnight. There were no guests in the reception area and two people behind the counter, one doing paperwork etc. I was completely ignored for a minute or so then the one who was unoccupied asked me if I was ok and I said I wanted to check in so he then asked the other man to deal with me.
I had already checked in online using the Hilton Honors app so the process was swift and efficient but there was no welcome as such.
Now the worst bit - I had selected my room online (Room 374) and I was given the keycard for it. However when I reached the room, I found that the bed had already been used with the quilt pulled back and the pillows had signs of use. Although there was a keycard in the slot on entry, there was no luggage in the room and it was otherwise clean but I was not happy to stay in there so I returned to reception. I was then given a similar room (370) which was fine but I was given no more than a casual apology.
The room itself was fine with a comfortable bed and pillows, good lighting etc but unfortunately just a shower and no bath, although there was plenty of room for a bath. I didn't ask but there does not appear to be an option to select a room with a bath (as opposed to the Hampton by Hilton at Exeter Airport where you can select a room with a bath). The air conditioning was very effective and a nice change to find somewhere that does not turn off the cooling function overnight.
The biggest disappointment with the room is that the curtains were not full blackout curtains and, although dark, they did let in a degree of light in the morning. I know Hampton by Hilton is a different brand to Hilton but my experience of Hilton hotels is that they invariably have full blackout curtains. To me this is particularly important at airport locations as people often want to rest in the day and can be flying to and from different time zones.
Although I didn't get up until 9.30am, I did not bother with the breakfast so I cannot comment on that.
This was my first stay at this hotel and undoubtedly I will stay there again purely because of the convenience of the location. I was certainly not disappointed except for the curtains but I just felt that the whole experience could have been better.","4","","2017-03-31","2017-04-18","2017-04-18","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r476946766-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The hotel is so conveniently situated for the airport.

The staff were friendly and welcoming.

Being so new the room was incredibly clean and the soundproofing on the windows 
meant no noise at all from planes.

On the downside the aircon unit was incredibly noisy making for a very disturbed night.

Breakfast was disappointing. We are at around 8am on a Sunday morning, the restaurant was very quiet with maybe 6 others tables in use.
The floor around the hot drinks stations had many, many spills. Some of which didn't look fresh. The floor in other parts didn't look particularly clean either.
Cutlery was tricky to find as the many cutlery holders hadnt been replenished.
The hot food counter offers the usual components of a standard English breakfast however the bacon and scrambled egg were not hot, the egg was barely warm.

As an aside because it isn't relevant to our experience I felt the staff uniform was casual to the point of scruffy.

The handy location of the hotel means I would stay again but my expectations would be low.","0","","2017-04-30","2017-04-11","2017-04-10","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r474421710-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

I had an early flight so was pleased to hear a continental breakfast was served from 4am. 

The reasons the hotel doesn't get more than an average rating for me however is that while I couldn't hear any outside noise, inside the room was another story. I was woken throughout the night by bangs and strange noises emanating from the direction of the bathroom/hall. Front of desk staff as well, while not impolite, we're lacking in a warm welcome.

The first was the automatic door did not work and it was quite heavy to open without electrical assistance, only one of the two lifts were operational, in the room there was only two sweeteners and no sugar, at breakfast the coffee machines did not work though one of them was fixed later and finally the sausages and bacon had not been refilled.

There are no rooms with bath tubs but this was fine with me as I enjoy the showers at the newer Hampton Inns. The hotel is right next door to the airport terminal, although it is a 3 minute UPHILL walk. 

Now the problems. Although the hotel has its own parking lot, it is operated by Bristol Airport which charges about 17.50 pounds to park overnight with NO concessions for hotel guests. This is a diabolical overnight charge BUT it gets worse. You have to pay to just register for your room and drop your suitcases off (I think 1.50 UKL). I had pre-arranged and paid for parking at the adjacent Premier Parking Lot (again at a rip off rate) and did not want to pay again just to let my handicapped wife enter the lobby. 

Although the hotel did not seem to be full, the choice of rooms was extremely limited. No ice machine or guest laundry and lacking in atmosphere on a cold blustery English March evening. The food on offer seems very limited - I would describe it as poor bar food. We ordered a pizza which we took to our room - it was OK but about twice what I would expect to pay.

Hampton Inns have a decent free breakfast. Because our flight departed at 7.00 a.m. we could not stay and indulge in the breakfast but we were offered a continental breakfast. Again, sounds good but the reality was something else. The orange juice dispensing machine was broken, there was no jam or marmalade for toast or croissants, and guests were complaining that the coffee machine was also non-functioning. Overall it was an underwhelming experience that was not inexpensive. 

Not the hotels fault, but my whole experience at Bristol Airport left a lot to be desired. Rip off parking fees, way out in the middle of nowhere, crowded at 6.00 a.m. in the morning, vastly overpriced shops, slow security and primitive. Our EasyJet flights to Barcelona were a false bargain when taking into account the charges we had to pay.","3","","2017-03-31","2017-03-30","2017-03-30","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r471507219-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

We stayed with you the night before we flew.
I booked the hotel for ease, as the details state a short walk to the terminal.
I parked at the main door to advise reception that we had arrived, i advised we had 2 large bags a wheel chair + other small bags and a husband that does not walk very well, hence the wheelchair.
There were a number of staff not doing very much, it would have been nice if a member of staff could have offered to help.
But no i had to do it all, i should not have to ask.
In the reception area, were the large trollys that you get in the better quality hotels, so not much lifting was required.!

I dropped off my husband at the door, along with our luggage.
Just to add a little extra, i had a hip replacement last year.

I drove the car to silver parking as i could not get parking at the hotel for the time that we were away.

Good job really, i was alarmed to discover how much walking was involved from the terminal.
I asked a member of staff on my return from parking the car about help the next morning as we left the hotel at 5am, some suggestions but nothing was very helpful.
My Husband had to push his own wheelchair while i pulled the suitcases,this took us at least 15 minutes.
My husband suffered chest pains for about 1 hour after the walk.

It would have been easier to stay at the holiday inn or one of the other hotels,at least you get door to door service.

We paid £99 to be just a short walk to the terminal, that caused us both pain stress and worry that my husband may not be able to fly had the chest pains continued.

We had a starter in the restaurant and a main meal, it all came out together, luckerly we had to send the barbecue chickens wings back, that were not with chilli that we could not eat them, and ordered a salad as a replacement, that we almost got as a desert
I booked this for a treat for our 40th annerversay

Unfortunately no bath, which was something I had really looked forward to after travelling, but a nice shower and good wash products available in dispensers.

Ate in the restaurant that night, food was a great value for money, and all very yummy. A complimentary breakfast was also served the next morning for anyone catching an early flight, there was a of variety of food available and of really good quality.
Unfortunately Staff were quite dismissive, everything seemed to be an inconvenience, which was a shame because it was the only thing that really let the hotel down.

Parking is pricey but then you have pay a £1 for 10 minutes at the drop so to be expected.","0","","2017-03-31","2017-03-08","2017-03-08","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r465582856-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

The staff were very helpful and good at Thier jobs. For a new hotel we were expecting teething problems. But this was not the case. Well done to all  the team and we look forward to staying at the hotel again. Also don't forget you get a free breakfast which just concludes your stay with a full belly  =)","0","","2017-03-31","2017-03-07","2017-03-07","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r465261944-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Was also unable to pay with company AMEX. Also back entrance to hotel also broke down. Once this new hotel resolves these teething problems. I will wholeheartedly recommend it.","0","","2017-03-31","2017-03-06","2017-03-06","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r465224738-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

From start to finish very poor.  The hotel looks good but was freezing.  Rooms are nice and do the job.  Ventured down stairs for some bar food which was terrible and half an hour late.  Again downstairs was freezing staff really poor.  Didn't get any better for breakfast!!

- Ideal to rest a few hours between flights or before hitting the road the next morning.
- Yet the rooms are very quiet.
- I stayed overnight in room 118, it was nice and tidy, it looked like it had just been refurbished, compact yet comfortable.
- Good light in the bedroom. 
- There is free wifi internet access, yet I cannot rate since I have not used it.
- The room appeared extremely clean, well done cleaners!
- The staff are totally customer focused and make sure that you are going to have a positive experience.
- Very supportive mattress enabled me to get good rest over just 5 hours sleep.
- Quality linens.
- Very nice and easy to use shower.
- The soaps / shampoo / conditioners form dispensers are of high quality and nice fragrance.
- The breakfast is comprehensive with a lot of choice of hot and cold foods and drinks.
- I could not find any fault  
- I highly recommend.","3","","2017-02-28","2017-03-03","2017-03-03","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r464256896-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Highly recommend. ","Stayed at this brand new hotel a few nights after they opened. I don't think our room had been used once before our arrival. Everything was in perfect condition. Staff, though clearly still training, were welcoming and kind. I was particularly impressed with the fact that they open (free!) breakfast at 4 am for those taking early flights. Speaking of flights, this hotel's location a 3 minute walk to airport is perfect. We walked over in the evening to check in early for our flights the next day. Then we returned so smoothly in morning without worrying about traffic delays or anything at all. I highly recommend this Hotel if you have an early flight out of Bristol. I'm very impressed.

Check in was very slow as they were having problems with their computers. The rooms are basic and 'compact' but have the facilities needed for a 1 night stay before a flight. 

We went down to the bar and soon realised there were 3 girls trying to cover reception, the bar and restaurant. Not really fair as their tills kept crashing and they were getting flustered.  Not their fault, they were nice and friendly and we're doing their best.

Should be a nice hotel once the teething problems are sorted out. ","3","","2017-02-28","2017-02-25","2017-02-25","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r462778220-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"

Friendly check in staff  especially Anna who went out of her way to look after us. Comfortable rooms are well decorated air conditioned quiet and free from aircraft noise. Bathrooms with large shower area.
A bar and restaurant serve 24 hour light food from a very limited menu. 

24 hour fitness area.

Bristol airport has poor access roads with many delays. The city suffers horrendous traffic delays with endless unfinished road works so travellers beware and plan ahead.

 I recommend travellers with morning flights stay here overnight relieving stress whilst ensuring not missing a flight .

Ideal for business. Meetings. Family.","3","","2017-02-28","2017-02-23","2017-02-23","en","Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport","11642149","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d11642149-r462347963-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html"
