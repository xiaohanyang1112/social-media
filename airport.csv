Fine. As expected.
"," 9.0 ","Friendly staff, comfortable room, good breakfast, perfect location","The price is rather high for the quality here.  It is within easy walking distance of the terminal, so perhaps worth it, but it seems to me they are milking a captive audience. I f you want to stay at Bristol airport, you have to stay here, and you are paying substantially more than the quality would otherwise demand for that.  The biggest other problem is that the parking situation is awful. The parking at Bristol is abysmal, and it would be really helpful if the hotel parking was at least competitive, pricewise. Going away for a three or four day  business trip,  you really want to be able to park at the hotel and pick up your car their upon return. At the current pricing this is not practical,","

Comfortable hotel to stay in if arriving late, or leaving from the airport early.
"," 8.0 ","The location next to the airport was very convenient. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The toom was totally silent so the soundproofing was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The noticeboard for the flights was very useful.","The television had no access to Netflix or other apps which was a bit frustrating.

Lovely rooms - eat before you arrive
"," 7.0 ","Lovely room, nice clean and comfortable. The staff member who checked us in was lovely. Very close to the airport making it very easy for our 7am flight, expensive for a nights stay however for the convenience it was worth the price.","The food. 
Very expensive poor quality food, had I known it would be the case we probably would have eaten before arrival. £40 for 2 Pepsis, 1 panini and a very tasteless chicken korma. I wouldn’t mind the price had the food been good. 
The young girl on the bar I dealt with was also quite rude, when I asked if I could pay cash she literally laughed in my face and said “there’s literally a sign right there that says card only” pointing at it. 
The smallest printed sign on front of the till, no mention of it on the menus. Rooms great, food definitely needs improvement.","

So so convenient for an early bird flight.
"," 9.0 ","I travel to Jerez de la Frontera regularly to do flamenco classes with teachers there. Not exactly leisure nor work. It’s a long journey and to save time and money I invariable catch a very early flight. I can then travel on from Malaga to Seville and then Jerez. The hotel stay makes that possible and I can leave the car in the Silvee parking and go to bed in comfort. The breakfast in the morning is a bit grundgy - but I do have a particular diet (no dairy milk, no factory bread, only organic). It is included with the price though. 
This time we had to take a long detour walking to avoid building work. Never mind all wirth it.","The staff are great. The rooms excellent.","

Absolutely fine and the croissant were really good
"," 8.0 ","The hotel is clean and comfortable. Croissant at breakfast were good. The rooms are comfortable. The price I think is high for what is basically a upmarket Premier Inn. However, it is the only hotel by the airport so I can fully appreciate why there is a premium. We chose to pay the price as my husband had an early flight and we wanted to be as close as possible to the airport. We could have stayed at the Clifton Gorge Hotel Du Vin for the same price which would have been much more of a 'special' stay but as we basically just wanted a bed for the night this was fine. It is a hotel that offers what it says it will do. The staff member I dealt with at check-in was very friendly and helpful.","Very small thing but I was surprised that there was only standard tea or coffee sachets in the room. I would have liked a green/peppermint/ or something similar before going to bed.","

Very convenient for airport, comfortable and friendly staff.
"," 9.0 ","Convenient to airport, nice comfy beds.","In my view, the basic lunch and dinner food menu lets the hotel down. Curry ‘special’ tastes like a standard supermarket microwave meal. Food always seems like it is  just heated up prepared meals and not cooked from scratch. Ok but basic and not very appetising. Even the menu itself is like a piece of laminated card and does not look very professional. I think an improvement to the above will go a long way to promoting the image of a classier hotel.","

Very good
"," 8.0 ","I bought an excellent burger and chips for my evening meal. But more of a choice of a set menu, more formal, evening meal which I would expect from a ""Hilton"" hotel instead of ""fast food"" would have been preferable.
Breakfast was good, although the English breakfast could have started a little earlier because of early flights.
I could not fault the room, clean and warm and even though just yards from the runway - no noise from aircraft!!!
Usually not a hassle to get from the hotel to the departure lounge - but difficult when the site is being upgraded.","The only fault I can state is the fact that, even though it was beyond the hotel's control, the area around the departure/arrival terminals were being, so called ""upgraded"".
I believe that the hotel could have offered customers a free system for them and their baggage to have been taken to and from the terminals, instead of the 10 - 12 minute convoluted walk, when the walk would usually have taken 2-3 minutes! Wouldn't have been a problem except for the fact it was pouring with rain!! And a taxi for the 500 metre ride was quoted at £15!!!","

Difficult and tricky. All our clothes are soaking.
"," 7.0 ","It was refreshing to see everything you needed was there, and the staff were exceptional","The problem is that Bristol Airport is undergoing major infrastructure changes and it took over an hour to drive from the main road to the hotel. We then had to do bag drop in the airport and the walk was 10 minutes in pouring rain with no canopy shelter. we had the same journey in the morning to the airport in the pouring rain. We are going on a cruise so had four bags to drag through and made paths. It was very dangerous on the roads approaching the hotel with people resorting to walking in the dark in the rain with no street lights. The car rental place took nearly an hour to get from the hotel to drop off and back again. Had we known this we would’ve stayed somewhere else.","

staff friendly, welcoming, provided a carrier bag breakfast due to pre 4.00am departure is brilliant
"," 9.0 ","The hotel is right by the airport, but there were quite a lot of steps and I would not have managed them alone with a heavy suitcase. The room was excellent - clean and comfortable.  We were at the back and able to go to bed at 9pm without being woken by noise of guests or flights.  Breakfast to go was very much appreciated at 3.40 am!","The food in the restaurant was not as good as I had expected: the choice was limited for me, and the burger and chips I ordered as a last resort was not overwhelming, just ok.  My husband chose a curry and was very happy with that.  It just shows how our tastes affect our reviews.  So other guests would probably love the food choices!!
I didn't like the two flights of steps between the hotel and the airport departures.","

An ideal location and a comfortable stay.
"," 7.0 ","The fact that the hotel is just across from the airport.  I liked the comfort of the rooms and proximity to airport and coach station.","I do not think the standard of breakfast matches the standard of the hotel generally.  For instance, last time I stayed there was a choice of fruit and yogurt which seemed to have disappeared this time.  I found the level of lighting in my room very low when I arrived in the middle of the night, and needed to quickly find things in my suitcase.","

My husband has difficulty walking, but when we said we had assisted travel, a member of staff arranged for us to be picked up by the airport assistance staff. This was excellent, but I think the hotel  needs to tell more of their staff about this facility, another member of staff suggested we could have got a taxi at about £15.","There are site works going on between the airport and the hotel, so it was hard to get to the hotel.","

Dry croissant, horrid apple juice and an apple or banana - that was it.

It was OK for an early morning departure

Because we were staying there specifically to fly out the next morning, we didn't want to head into town, so it was the only option. Also, there is no shuttle to the airport. It should be a short walk but the usual path was all dug up so we had to drag heavy cases a long way.","

Lovely rooms, great staff, need deep pockets
"," 9.0 ","Location was great, apart from the surrounding civil works to improve access, which was difficult to navigate amongst bus queues and barriers.
Room was lovely, shame we only spent 4.5 hours in it due to our late arrival, Room not ready due to demand, and a very early departure.
Clean and pleasant bar area, staff lovely. Overall pleased with the hotel.","Breakfast was basic at the early time we needed to leave for our departure, and there was too little food on display, with no staff around to replenish the food items, mostly run out of choice. For the overnight stay cost, including breakfast, we were very disappointed, and hungry during our day of travel. This was a letdown for us, especially paying £230 for a single night, we expected a better Breakfast experience, and not need to spend more money on food during our travels.
Also, drinks in the bar were very expensive, seems a captive audience are charged way over the normal going rate.","

Quite a lot of money for a large modern clean soulless room at convenient place for flight
"," 8.0 ","The breakfast was it's redeemable feature. I had croissants and fruit and yogurt and coffee. The breakfast was really good quality . Very pleased with the breakfast. It felt more homely and family orientated for the breakfast. A bit more heart and soul. Liked the decor and the happy slogans.","It was a bit of a shock that you queued up to place an order for food. As my friend said an expensive MacDonalds.  Coincidentally I ended up ordering the burger bun and chips. I felt starving hungry and needed something to fill me up. 
The burger was really good. So it worked 😁. 
Next time I would know what to expect. Might try another food option. Like the noodles for example. Just was expecting a sit down restaurant with table service like other airport hotels. I thought maybe they had trouble getting staff. The receptionist said there was no proper kitchen on site. Did not really like the atmosphere of the evening dining. Lovely chairs dining area but felt soulless in the evening. The company could have a better chance here to win hearts and minds.","

I've stayed in many hotels in recent years across Europe, Asia & South America and it seems to be ONLY Hampton & Radisson hotels at UK airports that continue to use feathers  & to refuse to put safety of guests first.  PLEASE CAN THIS BE REVIEWED.  I shouldn't have to make this request when I book at a hotel, especially at the prices charged.  I am sure you take other allergies eg. peanuts seriously so it would be much appreciated  - & easier for you -if you avoided risks by using the types of bedding now in use at the vast majority of hotels.","

Good

Check in process was relatively straightforward. Staff at checkin and checkout were very helpful. Breakfast was served from early in the morning which was great and plenty of choice and food for everyone. No queues at the bar or restaurant at breakfast. The room was very quiet and couldn't hear any plane noise or people moving about in the corridors or rooms which was great.  Would recommend to anyone with an early flight and that doesn't want the hassle of Bristol traffic in the morning","The bar staff were disorganised - couldn't find items on the till, didn't seem to know their drinks menu, randomly selecting sizes of drinks etc. But overall the stay was good.","

"," 8.0 ","Enjoy this Hotel as was very convenient & close to the airport. Perfect location. Hotel itself was very clean and modern. The room itself was great as it had everything u need.  Very comfortable bed and nice bathroom. No noise of the airport which was a bonus. Also the staff where Friendly and kindly hold are luggage for us so could have a day out in Bristol.","I sorry to say that theirs a few things that disappointed me. One was the cost of the room for one night £175 which is expensive. Another thing that  wasn't the best is the breakfast, I was so disappointed with it, considering what I paid. The full English was a big disappointment, no fry eggs, sausage where discussing, so was the scrambled eggs, bread too. Also the coffee was out of a machine, I could go on. Please sort it out, I wanted to complain but didn't have time as had to go.","

Not a cheap 1-night stay but well worth it for the great location & high standard of facilities
"," 9.0 ","Very helpful, friendly staff, great food selection at breakfast, lunch & dinner, so handy for accessing Bristol airport - just a short stroll to check-in. Lovely fresh decor in all areas and good-sized rooms. The option of a ground-floor room was a real bonus when travelling with heavy luggage.","Room felt quite cold and I was unable to adjust the temperature. Not sure if I was having a 'senior moment' and not pressing the right buttons, but an instruction card for adjusting the heating would have been useful.","

Breakfast was good and so was the supper.
When curtains closed in our room you had to put a light on. When sleeping it meant leaving a light on but none were dimmed enough not to keep us awake.

Good place to stay before an early flight.
"," 9.0 ","Very handy for the airport and helpful that they offer free parking while checking in and dropping luggage (we were parking at the Silver Zone park). As we had an early check-in for our flight we thought we would have to miss breakfast so were pleasantly surprised by the early continental breakfast available.","","

Superb
"," 9.0 ","The hotel is right next to the national Express bus stop and to the airport yet we didn't hear any noise whilst we were trying to sleep. The staff were very friendly. The room was spotless, shower was amazing. They also had a selection of games in the lounge area such as 'guess who' and 'battleships'. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.","The 'on the go' breakfast is NOT very good. It contained an apple, a cereal bar and a croissant. Considering you have breakfast included in the price and no option to remove it, I would consider a better 'on the go' breakfast for people who have early flights. For example, we had to leave the hotel at 4am and the hot breakfast doesn't start until 6/7am. A cold bacon/sandwich sandwich would have been better than a croissant in our opinion.","

Great location, attentive and friendly staff and excellent buffet breakfast. Recommended
"," 9.0 ","Hotel easily accessed from Bristol Airport, even with suitcases/prams down the accessible slopes.
Staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. We arrived at 12.30am and requested a cot. Two staff members met us when we arrived at the room and set it up very quickly so we could get the kids to bed.
Room and rest of hotel was clean and tidy.
The breakfast buffet included in the price the next morning was excellent. Great selection and coffee was good quality.
Hilton Honours allowed us to extend checkout until 2pm for free, which was great as our flight wasn't until 3.30pm. Once we made the pull-out bed back into a sofa, the room was sufficient size for us to stay in for a few hours.
Overall great stay, would highly recommend.","We were a family of 4 (2 adults and 1 child and 1 infant), so selected a Queen room with pull out bed and cot. Room was a little snug once the pull out bed and cot were out, but this was fine for a 1 night stay. The next day we folded the bed back to a sofa which gave us enough room.","

Although it seemed expensive the convenience adjacent to the airport and the comfort offered made it worthwhile.","Reception was a little slow, as the receptionist was perhaps inexperienced and needed assistance with the guests ahead of us.

Very good
"," 8.0 ","Very convenient for early flights as it is right next to the airport. Good and clean facilities. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is excellent quality, but most items don't get restocked, so make sure you get there fairly early to have plenty of choice.","Lovely hotel, but very overpriced for what it is. Unfortunately there is no real competition around, as it's the only hotel at walking distance from the airport. The price seems particularly high if you think that most guests (like us) only stay for a few hours, checking-in late evening and checking-out early morning.
The sofa bed in the family room was very thin and uncomfortable. It would probably be ok for a child, but not great for an adult.","

Didn’t experience other facilities as left very early in the morning but so convenient to stay right next to airport and get a good nights sleep before an early flight.","Bed was quite squeeky when I rolled over, and just wish the price was a little lower.","

Brilliant staff, convenient location and comfy room.
"," 8.0 ","We were travelling on a 6am flight with children so decided to book this hotel for the night before. Staff were excellent, hotel is very conveniently located with a short covered walk to the terminal and the multi-storey car park is right next door. Dinner was really nice and while I cannot comment on the official breakfast because we had to be in the airport before it started, a really nice touch they provided a small breakfast bag which was perfect to tie the kids over until we could get on the plane. We had a double room with a sofa bed which was perfect for the kids, really comfy stay.  Would definitely recommend for a nice layover or for making an early morning flight more convenient.","","

Perfect hotel for when you flight is cancelled and your next flight is the next night!
"," 8.0 ","My flight from Bristol was cancelled due to snow so as I had stayed at The Hampton previously, I instantly knew to book quickly as there was going to be a lot of people needing rooms that night. The hotel is the perfect location as its just across the road from the airport. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, which I don’t remember being the case on my first visit. I had dinner in the hotel and I have to say that it was better than I expected and not a bad price. Breakfast was a good selection.","I do think the rooms are expensive but I get that you are paying for the convenience of being so close to the airport, plus being the closest, they can charge those prices and still get the guests.","

The staff at the hotel in general are very friendly and ready to answer any questions. The room was refurbished, was spacious and had all items one could need during a stay.","The bed linnen had some area with a glue-like deposit on it which should have been picked up by the person preparing the room and it should have been replaced.

It was great to arrive in a such a welcoming place, both before departure -  and on our return.
"," 8.0 ","This hotel is the only one at the airport, so it could not fail, but its proximity to it certainly made for a very relaxed departure and arrival. The rooms were not huge, but the beds being very comfortable made up for that and the  toiletries provided: shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand wash and body lotion were good quality which made a welcome change as I did not need to unpack may own. The staff were, without exception, all lovely and helpful and pleasant.","it would have been good if the bathroom door had been lightproof, so as not to disturb the other guest when needing to get up in the night! It was made with a see-through perspex panel. Also - shutting it made a loud sound and leaving it open to avoid this meant that one was reflected in the mirror opposite the door, whilst doing what you needed to - thus giving one's sharer a great view! We laughed about this, but you may not be aware! Secondly, the entrance area which is filled with tables for guests to drink and eat and meet was looking a bit tired with a few things scratched or peeling and in need of a bit of a refresh, décor-wise to properly meet the star standard.","

Friends came for a drink and were able to park for a couple of hours for free, which I really appreciated.","Before arriving, it was tricky to discover whether there was a restaurant, or just breakfast; also the parking situation.

An excellent option for an early flight from Bristol Airport
"," 8.0 ","We booked this hotel as we had a 7am flight and we did not have a car. It is a very short walk along a dedicated path across to the airport. Also, a continental breakfast was available from 4am which was excellent. The room was very spacious and well-equipped and the heating worked well.","It is relatively expensive as it is the only hotel at the airport but it was worth it for the peace of mind.","

very convenient location but a few minor issues could be improved.
"," 7.0 ","Hotel  is the only one on the actual airport site so location is good and you don’t need a courtesy bus. Food in the restaurant was standard stuff but good. Rooms are comfortable and quiet and breakfast albeit continental is on from 4:00 am as many staying are on early flights. Good welcome from reception.","The hotel is much lower than the terminal building and even roll along bags require either a climb up several steep flights of steps or a lengthy walk up a series of ramps. There is a short covered section but got soaked walking to the terminal in heavy rain. can’t imagine why a covered way isn’t possible. Restaurant area is getting tired now and for our evening meal (self service)it was difficult to find a clean table.","

The only problem was that the majority of the door is glass and there was also a large mirror opposite, meaning not only was the light in the bathroom shining but also reflected by the large mirror in entrance area, looks very nice and bright, but meaning that the bedroom area was lit up all night, not conducive to a good nights sleep by any  other person in party.","

The location was perfect for the airport and there was no aircraft noise either.
The room was also not too hot ( as many such hotels can be)
All in all a perfect place for an airport stop over.","Having to pay for parking was not ideal.

Great other than what ive mentioned already, really made my stay sour as it annoyed me quite a lot
"," 8.0 ","The stay itself was fine.","The fact you have to pay £5 to get out of the car in front of the Hotel or risk a £100 fine is a total joke! The check in staff were agreeing with me on this point and stated that its not under their control, which is fine I accept that! However you as a company/leading brand of hotels should be sticking up for your customers for such things to be removed. Why do you feel its ok for your paying customers to ripped off on your front door? Bristol airport are making a fortune from something completely unfair and people are not given an alternative. money money money that's all its about. Unfair.","

Food choice for dinner was limited and until I ordered the curries I found the beef burger and the calamari dishes quite tasteless and the salads were very limited.  
The tables in the dining area need constant cleaning and the soft furnishings need to be steam cleaned - they are stained and dirty with food.  It creates a bad impression altogether.","

Not great as we’d paid £165 for the night. We didn’t have toast, fruit etc as felt a bit awkward interrupting the morning briefing. The grumpy employee might have offered to help get the extra things we needed for a full breakfast.","

Staff were brilliant from my 2:30 am check-in, my everything is included breakfast and to finally check-out. Great help, good breakfast & great service, to be honest best customer service ive received in a hotel for over 2 years and THATS alot of hotels.

Did the job  though not a enjoyable and relaxing start to holiday, thought it was expensive.
"," 7.0 ","Convenient and geared up for flights, efficient and friendly check in. quiet, good beds, good sleep. Breakfast from 4 am ! 
Super close walk to terminal, though wouldn’t be ok if you had mobility problems as included 2 flights of steps.
Good that taxis get a free pass out otherwise they won’t accept pick up .","We were sorely disappointed by the poor quality, limited choice and poor value of evening meal . The ‘Special’ was a dried up cheap pie, brown smash and a few mushy peas - only the gravy made it edible. I thought even the staff were embarrassed. The dining room area was grubby and tired (seats stained and bits of coleslaw / food o do had to watch where you sat).Badly arranged canteen style with little ambiance  or coziness and  was a continuation of reception and the thoroughfare to the airport. 
Breakfast was really good but chaotic, only one coffee machine switched on , run out of teabags, food stations and crockery/ cutlery not topped up - so took ages to find things you wanted . 
Room was good except for trim missing on bathroom door and grubby and shredded shower tray non slip section .
Not what I expected from a good brand and premium price.","

Disappointing compared to previous stays
"," 7.0 ","We have stayed here quite a few times when having an early flight or late arrival. In terms of proximity to the airport and pure convenience, it just can't be beaten.","Compared to previous stays, this was disappointing. The hotel remains unchanged in terms of cleanliness, professional staff and convenience etc., but the price we paid was considerably higher than before - I would say double the price, if not more. My past reviews were, of course based on a lower price, and therefore better value.
The food served also seemed to be of lower quality - same menu, similar price, but just not as good. 
We have decided, despite the obvious convenience, not to repeat our stay at current pricing levels.","

Nice hotel, dinner in restaurant poor

Breakfast setup great for early flights
Quick walk to airport","Food was terrible. Ordered a jacket potato with beans for my daughter, the beans were stone cold with some scrambled egg in them??? Couldn't help but think they were left over from breakfast. Gross. 
I ordered a burger and chips and neither were even warm! We sent both meals back (after having to flag restaurant staff down they were no where to been seen during the meal) but both came back barely warm again. Couldn't be bothered with the faff of having to find someone again as we were starving from travelling. 
No one came to check or say sorry it was really poor for the price of the food and the price of the rooms!","

Convenient location but what happened to my pajamas??
"," 7.0 ","Convenient","I left my pajamas in the room and only noticed when I got to the holiday destination but thought no worries picking up thecar in a week's time I will call in to Reception which I did. Told them I had been in Room 10 a week ago but staff said no pajamas.  Either the cleaner took them or simply threw them away.  I emailed the General Manager and have heard nothing.
Considering we paid £186 for the room and we had to leave at 2am in the morning and we were told there would be breakfast bags to Takeaway which there wasn't I think it is not good value.
Surely a hotel of this size must have some sort of Lost Property system in place.","

early morning flight makes a pre flight hotel essential.
"," 7.0 ","located on the main Bristol Airport site. a short walk from the terminal. as the airport struggles to administer flights a pre flight hotel is essential. early morning flights are severely impacted. travel to the airport the night before and maximise your sleep.
the staff at the hotel are warm and welcoming","it's a shame that that the hotel fails to deliver the basics:
bed - wobbles around

Eventually got booked into my room and the payment was taken during the early hours of the next morning. Once I got to my destination country I had a notification off my card provider to say the hotel had taken the same payment again. So did the person I was travelling with. Could not get hold of them by phone so upon arrival back to Bristol Airport had to physically go in the hotel wait for ages in the que and then take the issue up with the person on the check in desk. It was resolved but was hassle I could have done without.","

This was also not advertised that you had to pay the parking and if it was not for the staff explaining how to do the parking I would have ended up with a large unexpected bill.
The bar was cashless. The other issue was the bar/restaurant was cashless. If you did not have a credit card then you could not purchase any food or drink.","

Decent stay at Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport
"," 7.0 ","Check in was excellent, really attentive, genuinely friendly and helpful. 
I travel a lot and so often reception and check in is awful. It's the first contact the guest has with the hotel and important to be right.
Room was comfortable, clean and generally quiet. Asked for a quiet room away from lift traffic and was accommodated.","Food ordering system and other pushy customers jumping the queue.
Appeared that some groups had package holiday vouchers which, to them, meant entitlement and special treatment.
It's a package holiday airport hotel so I suppose that is to be expected.
Food was OK, bar team very helpful given the circumstances.","

The complementary breakfast had everything you could want.","There weren't a tonne of food options for the evening meal, mostly fast food like burgers, pizza, potato wedges, and a daily dish (one meat, one vegan).

Great location and comfortable room but dire dining
"," 7.0 ","Pleasant clean and modern room, very quiet and comfortable. Breakfast is laid on from 4am, hot food from 6am and you can take away portable items if you don’t have time. Very close to airport terminal.","The food and dining experience was on the level of a motorway services, and not the good services like Gloucester and Tebay either. You are effectively eating in the foyer, unable to get away from screens with football and the food itself is barely edible and certainly not wholesome, being largely white carb. The red lentil Dahl for £12.95 was very overpriced, devoid of flavour or spice. The felafel burger was also a very long way from the original concept. 
There is no signage to the hotel if you want to find a pedestrian/wheeled luggage route from the long stay car park to the hotel. If you are foolish enough to consider dropping off passengers and luggage before parking think again as a van patrols the airport looking for reasons to dine you £100. Happily we could park near enough in the end.","

Massively convenient hotel for Bristol airport.

The parking at the multi-story is also convenient and although expensive, we got a reasonable deal as we pre-booked.  It's a nice touch having the boards up with the flights - really helpful to know whether to walk over or wait.","The signage could be better - we ended up taking a long walk detour to get to the right walkway, when we could have gone through the hotel and walked out the other side - a simple thing to rectify if the owners choose to do so!","

Very good breakfast with impressive choice for such an early start (4.30am was when we went) - hot breakfast starts at 6am. We checked out access to airport the day before our flight: you can get a luggage trolley from near the hotel for £2 and use the ramped access to the terminal (we are in our 70s so it solved the problem of trying to lug heavy cases up flights of steps). We have booked again for our return flight.","","

I would definitely stay at this hotel again for its convenient position close to Bristol Airport.
"," 9.0 ","The breakfast was a great self-service set up and good early start for those having to check-in for an early flight from Bristol Airport. A shame the waffle maker wasn't up and running early, but understandable.
Having the live flight departures and arrivals information up in the restaurant area was helpful and reassuring.","Initially, I was put off by the parking price information when I first arrived, but after visiting the hotel reception I learned that customers of the hotel paid a reduced overnight price which was far more bearable. It would be better if customers didn't have to pay for parking for the duration of their stay.","

Fabulous and super friendly!
"," 9.0 ","We have stayed in many hotels all over the world but the customer service here was fabulous and up there with the best. So warm and genuine. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff really seem to enjoy working at the hotel and it shows. We were only at the hotel for 1 night but were made to feel so welcome from the moment we checked in. The restaurant was great too. Decent menu, service, quality and prices. It all felt very safe despite Covid and restrictions. The room was spotless. The very short distance from the airport terminal made it super convenient and there was ample parking outside.","I honestly hate to leave any negative comment as the positives were so good but it would have been nice to have a bath in the room. I kind of expect that of a Hilton. The sofa bed's springs also dug in during the night but the soft quilt kind of helped detract from that!","

accommodation fine but food appalling
"," 9.0 ","everything except the evening meal and bar","At the Hampton our room and facilities were fine but the food at our evening meal was more than disappointing. It was probably the most unappetising food we have experienced. We had the falafel veggie burger described on the Menu as being with bread and butter pickle, tzatziki and chips, which were just cooked and only warm.
The item came with ‘salad’, which was not described in the menu and which we were told was standard for a burger being lettuce, tomato, and onion. Not everyone likes onion and removing it from food after it has been sliced is equally unacceptable. It should be recognised on the menu, for customers to have a choice.
The ‘bread and butter’ description was false as it was a Brioche, which is a sweet bun and totally unsatisfactory in a savoury dish. Staff and Manager were accommodating and helpful in accepting our criticism of the food.
The bar serves only malt Scotch Whisky and Irish Whiskey which is an unacceptable and expensive choice when requiring a long whisky drink with a mixer ie ginger ale, where a Blended Scotch Whisky is the norm. These are supplied under numerous titles such as White&Mackay, Bells, Grouse, etc. etc. It feels like your captive audience is being held hostage.","

Convenient comfortable hotel to stay in for early departure from the airport.
"," 8.0 ","The location is excellent for the airport. Breakfast was a bit disappointing as the cooked option was late coming out & we did not have time before our check in to take advantage of it. However what was available was fine. We liked the idea that rooms were sealed after cleaning to comply with COVID regulations.","Unfortunately a good number of people moving around the hotel were not wearing masks although we do realise that is something it's difficult for the hotel to enforce.","

The bathroom is excellent but unfortunately this time there was a bad sludge arould the seal of the shower tray, had I stayed more than one night I would  have expected a change of room, given the price paid","

There was something to eat even at 4am, which was helpful.","A bit of maintenance is already needed; in my room none of the power outlets by the bed worked; I was lucky that the cables I had with me were long enough to use the ones by the desk.

A typical airport hotel where you are there of one night only. Most things were to my satisfaction.
"," 8.0 ","Everything was as it should be, the room clean and tidy. The Receptionists were very helpful with instructing me to collect a trolley, and then they stored it, for me, in the Luggage Room, to assist with my baggage and early morning 4am start.  There is a ramp up to the airport that made pushing a laden trolley much easier.","I thought the menu was very poor,  giving an extremely limited choice. If you liked any type of burger you were catered for! I plumped for Cream of Tomato Soup - out of a tin - and a baked potato with a chilli con carne filling. (they wouldn't need a chef to rustle that up) I was expecting Dinner! - Nope!
Also, there was a horrible B.O. odour in the room, on arrival.","

Highly recommended for early departures and late arrivals
"," 9.0 ","Always reliable hotel, great for late arrivals or early departures.  The rooms are beautifully appointed and quiet, soundproofing must be good. The staff are friendly and helpful. My wife had to make a trip into Bristol in the morning (losing our spot in the long stay which doesn’t allow reentry) but the hotel were happy for her to park in the hotel car park when she got back, which was very much appreciated.","There was a technical problem between the booking.com and Hilton systems which meant that we were initially overcharged for our room, but the front desk were very helpful in sorting it out and fully refunding the difference.
It would be great to have some kind of rapid checkin for late flight arrivals as everyone arrives at once and is so tired.","

Excellent accommodation in a terrifically convenient place.
"," 9.0 ","Excellent hotel, well appointed, extremely clean.  We had very good service from staff serving the food and from Reception staff.  Well done to all.","The menu was extremely limited and didn't allow any real choice.    The food that was served was shockingly bad - the coating on the squid was mushy and uncooked; the macaroni cheese was full of flour that hadn't been cooked out, was pale, completely lacking in cheese and, to boot, cold.   The 'special' was cannelloni and that was more of the same.    The hotel was very let down by the food but that can't detract from the main function of the hotel which was the provision of excellent accommodation and comfort.","

Table service but not enough staff.
"," 7.0 ","Room was very comfortable and food (when it arrived) was good.
Staff were very friendly and helpful.
Lasagne was tasty, and plenty of it. Pizza was well cooked.","Service in the bar/dining area was very slow. Took over an hour to have two beers, two meals and two shorts. Staff were not very attentive. Tables weren’t cleared and drinks orders were taken and then took 15 minutes to arrive. They were absolutely lovely and friendly, but just not very quick. Three staff in the dining/reception area to check people in and look after ten people in the bar. I can do that on my own. 
Place is very over priced (£120+ for two people  for bed and “breakfast”, which consisted of a bagged croissant, fruit, coffee, juice and fruit juice - but they have a captive market, have to recoup money from being shit down, and can ultimately charge what they want due to the location. I don’t mind paying the money for the convenience, but they need to make it worth me spending the money. For that money I would expect a decent breakfast to be available before 0600 for a start.","

Next to the airport- great location for odd hour flights and very clean rooms.
"," 8.0 ","We had an early morning flight and chose Hampton because it is literally 5 minutes walk away from the airport. Very comfortable location. Only downside was taxi to city center was rarely available and we had to wait for 30 minutes until we got ours. For early morning flight, the hotel had arranged takeaway breakfast including juice/coffee, croissant and a fruit. It could have been a bit better but i am not complaining as i am not much of an early morning breakfast person.","We took a three person occupancy room. The main bed was clean and comfortable but the sofa cum bed for the third person was very uncomfortable. That can certainly be worked upon.","

Lovely stay, so close to airport after a long day. Comfortable, clean & tidy. Excellent breakfast!
"," 10 ","Close to the airport, well sign posted. Comfortable bedroom, good shower, TV worked well. Bar was well stocked, staff friendly and professional. Breakfast was amazing, one of the best I’ve had in an airport hotel!","Reception didn’t take my card details on check in and I needed to add this later when getting a drink from the bar.

A Little Pricey But Worth it for the Convenience
"," 10 ","The location was superb - literally a few steps from the terminal. I was up at 4am, eating breakfast at 4.15pm and on the plane and flying by 6am as I had no luggage to check in. The room was sparkling and spacious too. Loved the 4am breakfast option and flight details on departure boards in the hotel.","It was a bit pricey, but I appreciate I was paying for the absolute convenience of it all.","

Perfect hotel in Bristol Airport
"," 10 ","Location to Bristol airport was great 👍","The shower tray got full of water and drained very slowley,
And a suggestion would be to have a lift up to the road area we're the airport is so that earthly people and disabled people don't have to go all the way around up the hill with the languages,wheel chair or there walking stick.

There was a stain on my bedding and the room was cold. The breakfast was a buffet and no proper full on 'English'. Just felt that the H by H are totally exploiting the location of the hotel in relation to the airport. You expect to pay more, but not at the expense of service, quality or cleanliness.

A  very mixed experience. Good, but not cheap hotel who failed to deliver on this occasion.
"," 6.0 ","After a serious problem the night staff led by Gill  did their best to resolve it.
While our sign in was unwelcoming, when Gill took over a few minutes later and dealt with my complaint, she was excellent and ensured that next morning we would have transport to collect our car. Great service, especially when compared to my comments below.","Poor communication. Through no fault of  the hotel the footpath was closed which meant a 10 minute walk with two  large cases, one of which had no wheels so a struggle for two aged 78. When we raised this at the hotel we received a totally unhelpful response at the hotel check in by a rather curt man on the desk. It appears that we should have received a message by text to say if we needed help then we could get it and how. No message ever came and the text that did only explained the path closure and the long walking route. There was supposed also to be a notice at the arrivals doorway, but nothing evident at 10.30 at night.","

Very impressive. A well designed hotel with travel in mind and the staff filled the space well!
"," 10 ","This hotel has looked carefully at the needs of travellers needing to make a quick getaway. 
The design of the rooms - and especially the bathroom - was exceptional . No bigger than most airport hotel rooms, it made excellent use of space. From the sliding bathroom door that 'closed'the wardrobe to the simply but thoughtfuly designed desk, bedside tables, multiple power points and superbly positioned shower controls and soap/shampoo this room had been carefully designed with the traveller in mind. No space wasted. Everything provided - even a safe. A+ facilities.   The front desk and bar staff also worked as a team in a well-designed lobby and cafe. Superb.","At first I did not like the fact that we couldn't book the room without breakfast - but - the way that they had set up the buffet  breakfast by the airport exit door was again so you could grab a quick bite en route. Again - very thoughtful layout and design.","

Good in parts
"," 5.0 ","Position, Breakfast, subsequent bus ride to silver car park.","My pre stay email requesting sheets and blankets if possible was quickly acknowledged .
On arrival told not available and accepted extra sheets, and told to ring 0 and ask for them. On doing this told blankets were available and would arrive. Later call to our room denied  their availability, In a somewhat fraught manner. 
Perhaps a better outcome could have been achieved by indicating that my request was not possible.
The other problem was dragging suitcases from the airport to the hotel when a long detour. Best wishes John Friend (A fit 87 yr old!)","

Nice hotel as close as you will get to the airport
"," 10 ","This is across the road from the airport breakfast and rooms were lovely and staff helpful however we didn’t know we could arrange assistance even though they knew we had a disabled person with us they never told us. I booked a disabled room and told them I had a 94 years old with me!","So when we booked it said free parking by the time when we went they had started charging £45!! We weren’t told and after I complained they wavered it.","

We want to sue you for screwing up our holiday and dismiss your incapable mangers

We were flying to Cape Verde and so had no wet weather gear.
The walk is steep. 
I have declared Medical Conditions: Hypertension, Cholesterol levels, Angina Coronary Angioplasty,  Rheumatoid Arthritis. 
We asked manager for assistance he said no.
I was exhausted when I reached the airport soaked as the rain was extreme. 
On the return journey I telephoned your hotel from Arrivals at Bristol Airport. The manager informed me the situation had not changed we would have to walk the long way round but I said it is bucketing down with rain. We arrived soaked manager said it was not their responsibility. Under Freedom of Information how many other complaints have been made between 29-01-24 and 6-02-24 We want to sue you for this.","You should have provided a mini bus service to the airport.

Bad
"," 1.0 ","","The closure of the normal pedestrian route is wholly unacceptable when the alternative is a long detour. Blithely expecting your customers to haul luggage in the wind and rain beside a busy road at night is very bad for any hotel but for one that sells itself on convenience it is utterly unacceptable. You should have insisted to the contractor that a reasonable diversion was in place before proceeding with cutting off the normal route. If that was not possible you should have clearly forewarned your customers so that they could make alternative arrangements.","

Okay.
"," 5.0 ","Lovely and Clean. As we didn't arrive till early hours in the morning, we were able to extend the room departure till 2:00pm until our car arrived to collect us, free of charge, I just had to sign up to the Hilton honours.","Arrived off the plane, and had to drag our suitcases in the pouring rain to the hotel, it says a minute walk from the airport but this was misleading as my daughter, friend and I walked for about 5-8 mins to get to the hotel, (maybe a car to collect would of been okay) For the price of the room, £180, the bed sofa was really hard. Breakfast you had to serve yourself, tea & coffee was through a machine, the breakfast was okay but no fried eggs, only scrambled and boiled??? I am not a snob by all means but 180 for a room, service could of been better. After a long flight, hardly any sleep maybe being served breakfast would suffice.","

No choice at Bristol Airport.
"," 6.0 ","Room was comfortable and clean and heating adequate and responsive.
Bed was also comfortable and relatively firm.
Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful as we're the young people delivering food to table, but no table service as such.","Once again, the 'so called' restaurant was extremely disappointing with cold air blowing down on several uncomfortable seating positions (we moved twice!). 
This is probably the least comfortable pr intimate 'restaurant' I have ever patronised at any time, anywhere in my eighty years and would not have looked out of place in any motorway transport cafe.
Very little choice of menu and I suspect nothing was cooked to order but rather reheated in microwave as required. 
Food portions were very small and quality just about acceptable.
Meals and drinks had to be ordered at the bar with completely extortionate prices charged for drinks (Guiness @ £4.00 / half pt., Draught bitter @ £5.70 /pt.)","

Fantastic and thanks again
"," 10 ","Fantastic location for the airport. Only took us 5 minutes to walk from hotel to terminal. Staff were excellent and could not do enough for you. The hotel was beautiful. Christmas decorations were beautiful. Just loved the hotel. Breakfast started at 4 am which was brilliant as we could have food before our flight at 6.30am.

Excellent for the night before an early flight.
"," 10 ","Close to terminal. Very pleasant staff. Great breakfast. Comfortable beds and very quiet.
In the morning light and having found it the night before it was a three minute walk to the terminal.","Works on airport grounds made finding it from
the terminal in the dark(after twilight baggage drop) a little challenging but it was signposted and we got there without too much of a detour.
It was a little expensive (quite a bit more so than the Premier at Gatwick North) as was parking which might make me reconsider Bristol as a choice as we are equidistant from both.","

Average hotel and expensive for what it offered.  Lousy access route
"," 6.0 ","Efficient check in.  Clean, comfortable room","Booked specifically for location, this was negated by the VERY poor arrangements associated with the airport works.  A ten minute walk through pouring rain was definitely not what we hoped for or expected.  We paid for a convenience that was just not there.  Maybe a senior manager should walk the route from the airport terminal, with a suitcase, at night in the rain and see if they think the arrangement is acceptable!!!  Overall result means expensive one night stay without the expected convenience","

Not our Best Experience
"," 2.0 ","Location is ideal for flying from Bristol Airport and one member of staff who could apologise enough for or issues we experienced whilst we were there","The way we were treated when questioned over payment,  which had been made through Booking.com earlier that day , in front of an ever increasing queue of people waiting to check in. I showed proof of payment via my banking app and the confirmation email I received from Booking.com . After what seemed to take ages and more people joining the queue, she eventually went and got her manager to assist with trying to find our payment.  After her seemingly checking numerous monitors and with lots of clicking and me offering to show proof again , we were told that it sometimes it happens when payment made via Booking.com that both parties fail to communicate with each other.  Luckily, another position was opened, and the queue subsided whilst she was still checking things and we were eventually getting our key.  There was no real apology, and the manager did say she would contact Booking.com and confirm that payment had been made. 
On checking out the following morning, we were then questioned again for payment,  to which I said this should have been sorted the pervious night and I also showed proof of email and payment again to the staff on the desk , which was then accepted. 
We always book the hotel on site when flying from Bristol even if we are travelling on a later flight the following day,  so we can start our holiday as relaxed as possible,  but we really didn't feel relaxed this time.","

Great place to stay when you have an early flight. No complaints at all.
"," 10 ","I had an early flight the next day so decided to stay at the Hampton.  This is a great hotel - yes, somewhat expensive at about $200, but worth it for the convenience and the amenities. Easy dining experience (order at bar and food delivered to table).  Lots of sitting areas.  The room was excellent, spacious, comfortable, quiet, good quality all around.  Probably a 10 minute walk to the airport, especially as at the time I stayed (early October) there was a lot of construction requiring a circuitous path to the terminal.","Nothing","

"," 10 ","18 year old son stuck at the airport thanks to the air traffic control issues end August but Hampton by Hilton made it more bearable for us all.
Amazing staff - who as you can imagine were overwhelmed with angry & despondent passengers - clean, quiet and an easy walk to the terminal 
The staff even called him to wake him up for his 6.30 flight as this momma was worried he’d sleep through his alarm!!!","","

Lovely Hotel
"," 10 ","Well kept, quiet and comfy room.  The bed was great.  Nice staff.","I wish there had been more variety in the restaurant.  I am gluten free (NOT Celiac) and aside from salad with things missing and tomato soup which is too acidic, there was nothing for me to eat,   
I could have done without the fire alarm just after midnight.  An hour or so in the breezy parking lot with everyone, dressed only my pajamas was interesting but very cold entertainment despite everyone being considerate and helpful.  I stupidly left everything in my room, including my coat. They eventually brought us blankets.  It was worse for the parents with kids. It's always important that the whole hotel got checked out by firemen but then I had to get up before 4 am to catch my flight.","

On arrival at approx midnight I was told by the receptionist did I want the bad or the good news.  They no longer had the room I had previously booked and paid for but had a queen bed and sofa bed.  The sofa bed mattress was approx 1.5 inches thick and you could feel all the springs.  At that time of night following flight back there was no choice.   Neither of us got hardly any sleep.

The Breakfast is cheap end quality and if you have an early flight you dont get the complete works only continental, which is Okay .The car park is expensive. The beds are hard, which is fine if you dont have any skeletal issues eg arthritis ..The pillows aren't much better. so I always take my own. As I left the car park to take the car to the Silver zone the night before. I stopped short of the road but just after the exit barrier, to reset SAT NAV. That cost me £60 as security accused me of illegally stopping ..These stories are becoming more common. SO I will be giving other places a try from now on. Im done with the Hilton for now","

No water supply - entirely unacceptable!
"," 1.0 ","","There was no water supply when we woke up in the morning, due to a broken water pump, hence the poor ratings for comfort, value for money and facilities, and staff were completely unprepared and unhelpful in responding to this issue. We were unable to use the bathroom at all. Having travelled all day the day before and arrived very late at night, we were desperate for showers when we got up, but couldn't even wash our faces.  Staff were clueless and didn't offer apologies or alternatives, it seemed no one had taken charge of the situation. Very poor from a large chain who should have effective contingency plans in place for critical services like water supply. A 30% discount was offered which was then not applied to our bill. I have complained and asked for a refund and await hiltons response.","
