4,James,2024-04-28,"The hotel was: conveniently located, gave a friendly welcome and everything was smooth. The lady who cleaned my room was excellent. She was polite, friendly and couldn't do enough to make sure I was happy with the room. You were all great."
5,Sophie,2024-04-28,"Fabulous staff, great location! Reception staff were fantastic, especially Peter, who pulled out all the stops as it was a special occasion. Lovely location too. Easy walking distance to the old city."
6,Deryn,2024-04-28,Good location and friendly and helpful staff It was fine a wide choice. Carpets were stained in my bedroom otherwise all good
7,Zoe,2024-04-27,"Quite comfy and central location. Beds were comfy, shower was great! Staff were friendly and helpful. Parking available and the fee covered 24hr‚Äôs Room service‚Ä¶. Only pizzas available in the evening and you had to go down to the foyer to collect them ü§£ they also took a good 30 mins or so to arrive. Unfortunately we also looked out over building work but could see the park from a certain angle"
8,Luca,2024-04-26,"Good Staff, position Rooms a little old and decadent"
9,Simone,2024-04-26,"lovely hotel in a great location Room was lovely and clean, breakfast was very nice with a lot of variety Staff very friendly and helpful The bathroom was on the small side"
10,Laura,2024-04-24,Good  Finding the entrance of the hotel by car was challenging (there were some road works nearby too). More signs on the road please to direct your customers.
11,Julia,2024-04-24,Close to all amenities. Great breakfast Everything except the mattress! The mattress was very hard
12,Nancy,2024-04-22,Superb Really clean quiet room with amenities such as a TV and high quality toiletries. The staff were really helpful. The location was fairly central and very easy to get to the train station. It was fairly expensive for one nights stay.
13,Lesley,2024-04-22,"Overall a pretty successful short stay. The location was excellent. The staff were helpful and friendly, especially Marta in the restaurant. The breakfast was disappointing - fried eggs had been sitting on hot plate for ages and were hard, the bacon was very fatty."
14,Pavel,2024-04-22,"Good for one night Room was nice with a comfortable bed, with a very nice office chair (Herman Miller Sayl) and big table for doing some work. Shower came with nice shower gel and shampoo. Good location for the purpose of my stay as I went to Motion night club which is in close proximity to the hotel. Breakfast was very disappointing, very limited."
15,Wendy,2024-04-21,Good Great central location Bathrooms are quite small but the shower was lovely
16,Diane,2024-04-19,"Pleasant, but did not enjoy breakfast. Limited; but comfortable public area to sit and have a coffee. Staff very helpful. Cooked breakfast offered a good choice, however this is the second time we have stayed in the hotel and each time the breakfast items were only just warm and the plates were cold. The result was all the items on the plate were cold by the time we got back to the table. I particularly don‚Äôt enjoy cold baked beans!"
17,Francis,2024-04-15,"it was a nice stay Room was ample ,quite, had a view of the park which was part of a historical church. the room could have been a bit bigger for the price ."
18,Sesan,2024-04-12,Superb The staff were brilliant! The breakfast was very good. The bed in the room was a bit small. The AC did not work very well.
19,Shane,2024-04-11,"Very good Great staff, warm welcome, personable. Nicely appointed room. Excellent breakfast selection. Close to train station. Would definitely stay again. Air con was unpredictable and bed was a little rickety."
20,Daniel,2024-04-07,Good The bed was comfy the shower nice Not being able to park and walking ages to another car park and having no funding from the hotel to compensate for the parking charges like other hotels do
21,Salomonh,2024-04-06,"Perfect for our stay Close to the railway station and not far from centre we enjoyed our stay very much. Nice Staff (eg Dilara and Navi), very good breakfast quality, a comfortable bed and a good shower was provided. Even though we were facing a busy street quality windows allowed us to sleep very well. Socket was only provided at one side of the bed and not on both but there were plenty other sockets all around the room."
22,Joyce,2024-04-05,Very good Very helpful and friendly staff
23,Ana,2024-04-03,"Enjoyed our stay The staff was very friendly and the breakfast options were very good! One of the elevators was not working, the heating was not working (we were asked if we wanted to change rooms or a portable heater) and the TV remote was also not working (although they provided new batteries)"
24,Ulrike,2024-04-03,"Very good Very helpful staff, very nice breakfast and ideal for the station and the Airport."
25,Fiona,2024-04-03,"Would return Check in was polite, bar area was clean however did have to wait quite a while for service however. Breakfast was good but no vegan options. No vegan options at breakfast"
26,Lorraine,2024-04-01,"Good choice for a brief visit Good location, handy for train station. Dinner and breakfast were only ok."
27,Sunil,2024-04-01,Great for Business travellers like me. Great location. Everything is within walking distance.
28,Robert,2024-03-27,"Overnight in Bristol. Good quality chain hotel in the centre of Bristol. We have stayed here before, and it does everything it says on the tin. Good breakfast, with plenty of variety. The car park is very easy to see, but exceedingly difficult to find!"
29,Charlotte,2024-03-25,"Nice hotel, comfortable and good value Breakfast was good value and reception staff very helpful Really hard to find on the satnav"
30,Laura,2024-03-25,Decent stay Nice room and breakfast. The road towards the hotel was closed and no instructions were displayed. We almost missed the event we travelled for trying to find the hotel.
31,Sam,2024-03-24,"Good value, clean hotel with delicious breakfast Great breakfasts, very helpful staff Hard beds"
32,Diana,2024-03-21,"Would stay again The Hotel is easy walking distance from Bristol Temple Meads station. The reception staff was very welcoming and helpful. We were given a map and had an explanation how the get to our venue for the evening without really having to ask for it. The walk into the old town part was short. The room was clean and well arranged. The breakfast was good. The room was very warm and we did not seem to be able to get the A/C to cool it down. Maybe it was just us... but I mentioned it as we checked out and felt that my comment was being taken serious. A couple of things ran out during breakfast, and we were by no means late, and weren't replenished whilst we ate. We still manged to fill out tummies no problem though."
33,Seeseetv,2024-03-21,"Perfect for business overnight stay Great central location, onsite parking though chargeable More info on available car charging points would have been useful, didn't work on arrival but reception did manage to resolves so we could charge the car"
34,Tracey,2024-03-21,Great would stay there again Distance from city and staff were fantastic
35,Dan,2024-03-18,Very good Great location. Nice breakfast. Slightly small room but not disastrous.
36,Ashleigh,2024-03-16,Not great  Room right next to the lift and noise from the lift kept us awake all night . Requested a late check out of 12 agreed. Then hammering on the door constantly from 11 am would like twice about staying here again.
37,Debra,2024-03-13,"Superb The staff were sp friendly, yhe food in the restaurant was lovelyüòç. The sausages at breakfast were very anaemic"
38,Francesca,2024-03-11,"Good Good location, comfortable bed, didn‚Äôt mind me checking in at 11pm. My room had a nice view over a park which at night had the trees adorned with lights. The bathroom although clean was so tiny and very dated."
39,Lukrecia,2024-03-10,"Perfect location for town and the train station We stayed at the hotel overnight prior to catching a flight. The hotel is perfectly located - a few minutes walk from the train station and a short stroll from town. The staff on reception and in the restaurant were very attentive, polite and professional. We enjoyed our stay."
40,David,2024-03-07,"High quality central hotel offering excellent value for money The receptionist lady (sounded Dutch) was very wlecoming and moved us to a room overlooking the garden at the back. We only stayed one night as I was going to a concert at the Bristol Beacon and my wife was meeting old friends who live bear Bristol. The central location is perfect for the entertainment areas of the City and the local bars restaurants etc offer a range of cuisine and atmosphere. Breakfast options were good though both coffee machines were broken - a kind staff lady made us both coffees from a machine behind the bar Will definitely stay there again. The power on the shower was rather too weak to wash my wife's very thick hair. This was at least partially the result of the head leaking. Some of the wall tiles were cracked (Room 106) as was the shower basin, both probably the result of movement at some point. I reported all this on departure."
41,Amanda,2024-03-07,"Very good Breakfast was fabulous, staff were very helpful and pleasant"
42,Kayleigh,2024-03-06,As above Everything was fab. Food to the room (from the bar/restaurant) was delicious and all staff were very friendly
43,Nicola,2024-03-04,Superb The location
44,Rachel,2024-03-04,"Good room was good enough, suitable for my stay, location and breakfast was great the parking cost was only obvious after I had reserved the room, it was fine but a bit more transparency would be appreciated"
45,Robert,2024-03-04,"Good hotel Great location, friendly staff, very comfortable beds, decent breakfast Parking at ¬£20 a night is somewhat steep"
46,Lee,2024-03-04,A perfect weekend The breakfast was superb and the night life in the location was amazing very culturall Nothing
47,Williams,2024-03-04,"Will definitely be back Comfy beds, good showers, lovely toiletries, great location, helpful staff. Slightly short on staff at breakfast and gloopy porridge (but rest of breakfast good)"
48,Kayleigh,2024-03-03,"Cleaned and suitable for an overnight stay in the city Easy and friendly check in. Clean and tidy room The bed was very squeaky, everytime you moved over in bed it made a noise which didn‚Äôt make for the best nights sleep"
49,Martina,2024-03-02,"Very good Staff friendliness, location, great breakfast Bathroom very small, rooms smaller than look on website"
50,Diane,2024-02-29,Good  Having to wait for breakfast while the coach trip were occupieing the whole restaurant
51,Andy,2024-02-28,"Comfy hotel near to Bristol station Bed was comfy and lots of storage space. The breakfast was good and had lots of options. Staff were friendly and let me store my bicycle in the store room over night which was a big plus. check in and check out were quick and easy. Only thing I didn't like was the design of the floor tiles in the bathroom for safety reasons, they're white with a design that looks like splashes of water. So it looks like there's water on the floor but isn't, but when there IS water on the floor, you can't see it"
52,Jenny,2024-02-26,"Adequate with reservations The room was fine, if a little cramped for two people. There were sufficient towels and soaps, etc. Although facing the busy road, the room was quiet. The reception staff were very pleasant, if rather slow in checking in & out. The hotel charge was adequate for the services we received. Bottled water was provided. There were no USB ports in the room, surprising for an obvious business hotel. There was a fridge but it had been turned off. There were limited channels on the TV. We were encouraged to have lunch in the restaurant but when we arrived just before 12:00 we were asked to sit in a corner as they were still clearing away after breakfast. Whilst eating the cleaner progressed with a noisy vacuum cleaner across the breakfast area and then arrived at the corner we were seated at. She proceeded to vacuum around our table and even under our feet whilst we ate! We booked the hotel because the car park had EV points. I know they could not guarantee one would be available but we found none of the 3 points usable and had to go to a local supermarket and sit for an hour to recharge. We did not have breakfast as the lunch we had the day before was most unappetising. Inferior ingredients and tasteless."
53,David,2024-02-25,fair hotel but too expensive Nice staff location cold room breakfast not great tv was poor
54,Andy,2024-02-25,Good Location Disorganised breakfast arrangement Broken arm rest on chair in the room. Light on the TV where it has probably been damaged
55,Mcgeough,2024-02-25,"CLEAN AND FUNCTIONAL - A GOOD BUSINESS HOTEL A comfortable business hotel, very clean. Breakfast - could offer vegetarian options, and dairy alternatives. I asked for the oat milk and the memebr of staff wehnt off and don't bother to return. Breakfast - could offer vegetarian options, and dairy alternatives. I asked for the oat milk and the member of staff went off and don't bother to return A little further from the centre of town than expected, travel time doubles during traffic."
56,Alan,2024-02-23,"Convenient location, comfortable room, easy to use facilities but a little overpriced (in my view) I booked this hotel for its location just 10 mins walk from my company's office and less than 30 mins walk to the harbourside area too. Everything was simple and straight forward, staff were friendly and efficient, room was clean and comfortable, breakfast was of a good standard and served from 6am - great for an early start. Small niggles - no small cups for espressos at breakfast. No soft or dimmable lighting in the room (or at least, I didint find it) Similar to many hotel chains, I feel it was a little over-priced."
57,Rachel,2024-02-22,"Great location, good value. Clean. Great location! Easy walk from temple meads and city centre."
58,Wendy,2024-02-21,Great stay. Good location near railway station not to far into Bristol town centre.Comfortable room very quiet even thou our room was on the road side. All the hotel colleagues were friendly and helpful especially Navi who was on duty in the morning for breakfast. Can‚Äôt really think of anything negative.
59,Peter,2024-02-18,Superb Excellent location to transport and restaurants.
60,Tim,2024-02-18,Very good Location close to city centre Tiny bathroom
61,James,2024-02-18,Perfect location from which to explore Bristol with most attractions a relatively short walk away Great location and very friendly staff
62,Brad,2024-02-17,"Great location and good staff Location, staff Broken light in room, room upgrade to king didn‚Äôt feel like much of an upgrade"
63,Louise,2024-02-16,"Perfect, out of town, within easy reach of town stay. The property is ideal for us, as we travel by train. 5 mins walk tops, and we‚Äôre at the hotel. It‚Äôs a bit further into town, but still very central. Some lovely areas to pass through and things to see on the way. It‚Äôs a quiet hotel and the staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was pleasant. Nothing"
64,Joseph,2024-02-14,"The day was good. The breakfast was good, the staff excellent. Paying an extra ¬£20 for parking"
65,David,2024-02-14,Superb The bed and the breakfast were excellent No arm chairs in the bedroom
66,Freddie,2024-02-14,"We have stayed at the HGI in Bristol a few times. It‚Äôs close to the station, has parking, the rooms are OK, dinning room Good location, nice staff"
67,Roger,2024-02-14,"Good On site parking, albeit ¬£20 per 24 hours. Great location. Quiet room. Breakfast was average for a 4 star hotel."
68,Samantha,2024-02-12,"Very good Shared facilities were lovely. The breakfast was very good, lots of variety. Great location for heading to the shopping centre or the theatre which is what we were there for. The reception staff were very welcoming and accommodating too. The room was a little tired in places and needed some updating. Wonky switches, toilet roll holder, paint chipped off the skirting. It could have done with better sound proofing too, we could hear the couple above us quite clearly!"
69,Andy,2024-02-11,"Ideal spot for a weekend visit. Great location, close to the train station and the city centre, but also quiet enough to have a relaxing stay. The team were incredibly helpful and friendly from start to finish, and the breakfast was good to wake up to Late night room service would have been helpful, but we were able to order in Uber Eats, so there was a suitable alternative. The front desk were very happy to suggest this."
70,David,2024-02-11,"Would stay again Good location, good staff, nice breakfast One of the towels provided wasn‚Äôt clean"
71,Gary,2024-02-11,Very comfortable stay Rooms were gd staff great and welcoming and bar and breakfast v good

74,Andrea,2024-02-06,Very good Lovely clean hotel Staff are lovely. Close to station and City centre Nothing
75,Sue,2024-02-04,"Good location, close enough to the centre. Staff were very helpful and pleasant. The locality to Bristol Temple Meads"
76,John,2024-02-03,"Would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel. The location is excellent. Within easy walking distance to restaurants and pubs and The Fleece where we had booked to see a show. Very good breakfast included in the price. Finding the place was a bit of a nightmare but, to be fair this was aggravated by all the construction work going on in the area. To my mind the car parking charge of ¬£20 per 24 hours is a bit of a liberty. Although the breakfast was first-class the organisation was a bit chaotic."
77,Lizzie,2024-02-01,"Relaxing time with my sister Modern, spacious, clean Creaky beds! We did sleep well though so that‚Äôs good. Reception staff not massively friendly, could be a bit friendlier"
78,Pamela,2024-02-01,Very good  Too hot‚Ä¶couldnot adjust airco
79,Ian,2024-02-01,"Great team at this spotless city centre hotel Bar / restaurant/ reception team were excellent. Hotel and room were spotless. Even on the lowest setting, I couldn't get the Aircon cool enough."
80,Jamie,2024-01-30,"Very good Good value for money. It is a little older so some parts a bit dated, but overall a really nice place to stay. The staff were excellent."
81,Maria,2024-01-29,Good Location was great Room was dated and the temp control did not wirk well
82,Rachel,2024-01-28,A good location for a theatre visit. Nice and quiet and only a short walk to the city centre. A good breakfast with plen Very nice breakfast and a reasonably short walk to town Bed was uncomfortable
83,Tanya,2024-01-28,Excellent location and hotel Great location near the train station. Hotel very comfortable with friendly staff. Lovely breakfast with plenty of choice. Were able to leave our bags prior to check in.

88,Victoria,2024-01-21,"Nice hotel, great breakfast Breakfast was good however, no waffles available üòû Room 426, room was small, bed was uncomfortable and the toilet flush was poor"
89,Michael,2024-01-18,Great location for us and great bar at the garden behind the hotel. Location to linking travel. Breakfast included. Young Staff in the dining room were super attentive and observant! Well done. Receptionist was also helpful at check in as my card locked out. Breakfast cooked to order would be fantastic.
90,Barnes,2024-01-18,Superb Staff were very friendly and helpful on reception Bathroom had a bit of mould in the grout but it was clean
91,Sharon,2024-01-18,"Lovely Hotel After a long drive to reach the hotel the gentleman receptionist was so polite and welcoming ( he stated he lived in belper for a while) - a credit to the hotel ; Location is great - city centre and close to alot. Room was clean and the towels were large and fluffy, always a plus!! The chair in the room was tatty - the arm rest looked like it had be gnawed !! ( room 216)..."
92,Rachel,2024-01-17,"Very good The hotel was well situated between station, theatre and shops. Very clean and presentable. Friendly staff. Lovely breakfast with a good selection of food and drinks. Would recommend to family and friends and would stay again."
93,Nicola,2024-01-17,Superb Location
94,Chrissss,2024-01-16,"A good deal The hotel was conveniently located and easy to find. The breakfast was gorgeous and the bed extremely comfy. Good wifi and very friendly staff. I was a bit disappointed with the room size, I was promised a King Room but it felt cramped, the mini fridge was also unstocked and broken."
95,Mykhailo,2024-01-15,"Very good Overall experience is good, however we had expected a little bit better. The hotel has not been renovated for a while and it doesn't feel like 4-stars accommodation. But the breakfast was excellent and the staff were very helpful."
96,Clare,2024-01-15,"Very good Warmth, comfort gluten free bread toilet roll holder could have been cleaned"
97,Alun,2024-01-15,"Quick break to see a show. Breakfast was good, lots of choice. Room cold, air con noisy."
98,Terry,2024-01-13,I enjoy staying at the Hilton Garden. But feel it isn‚Äôt quite as good as it once was. Easy access to train station. Clean and tidy. The room was cold. And didn‚Äôt warm up all night. And breakfast needed to be hotter. The bacon was so cold I couldn‚Äôt cut it.
99,Robert,2024-01-10,"Overnight in Bristol. This is a smart modem hotel on Temple Way. Comfortable room, nice breakfast with lots of choice Nothing"
100,Joanne,2024-01-09,"Fabulous stay Friendly staff, great welcome, comfortable room and good shower Somewhat noisy airco / heating but was able to turn it off"
101,Kirsty,2024-01-08,"Good Good location close to the city centre, helpful and friendly reception staff and good breakfast. Small room which could have been cleaned better and bed not very comfortable. No lounge to sit and relax in."
102,Rob,2024-01-08,"A great place to stay for central Bristol A nice, modern hotel. Rooms were comfortable. Location was great for central Bristol and Bristol Temple Meads station. Breakfast was great - really nicely cooked as opposed to other hotels I've stayed at."
103,Jessica,2024-01-03,"It was a nice stay in a good location It's in a good central location. The room was nice, the bathroom was a little small and kind of in a corner with no bath just a shower cubical in the wall but it was sufficient for my needs. Parking is very limited and was full when I arrived at 9pm, I tried calling the hotel for help on where to park but was given directions as if I was a local which I struggled to follow in the dark in my car so I ended up searching for the nearest NCP carpark which was about 10 min walk away in the rain with my bags which wasn't ideal after a long trip to get there."
104,Chris,2024-01-03,"Waffles,waffles,breakfast is king! Central, clean and friendly ¬£20 to park overnight but to be fair it‚Äôs very close to the train station!"
105,Jennifer,2024-01-02,Overall enjoyed this friendly hotel Lovely location Excellent service and staff very polite Had an issue with hot water but had a child lock on it . Was sorted out quickly The bed was very uncomfortable and made a lot of noises
106,Keith,2023-12-31,"Wonderful Stay ! Fantastic location , opposite Temple Park and Temple Church. Ten mins walk to shopping mall and Old city. Friendly helpful staff with a smile. Clean room. Breakfast was basic but fresh. We enjoyed our 2 night stay. Highly recommended. Dinner was awful. My salmon tasted sour and my partner roast was Bland and dry. Gravy like water with no colour and body to it. Dissapointed!"
107,Juliet,2023-12-31,"Clean and well appointed room, friendly staff. Friendly staff, very clean, well appointed room, easy to park. Despite being on a very busy main road, it was quiet in the rooms. Breakfast was reasonable but no butter on the first morning and staff (whilst very friendly) didn't keep on top of making sure there was cutlery on tables, plates available at some of the food stations etc. A minor grumble, but some attention to detail lacking. Location not the best, on a main road with a fair walk to city centre ( we are happy walking, but others might not be) Parking expensive - ¬£20 per day."
108,Alastair,2023-12-30,A comfortable stay. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. Trying to find my way into the car park took a long time as not signposted that need to go round a load of back streets to get to it.
109,Mark,2023-12-30,"Superb Great breakfast, comfy bed. Bathroom was on the small side"
110,Rachel,2023-12-29,Excellent service and a great location The bed was so comfy and all the facilities were fine- the room was quite small and for a king room thought we would have a bath No bath
111,Ann,2023-12-24,A good city centre hotel. Room was clean and comfortable with a very good en suite. views over the city were good. Staff were very attentive and helpful with an excellent balance between friendliness and professionalism We struggled to find the parking at the hotel but this was probably due to the number of roadworks. Breakfast was a little disappointing as we felt that some of the food had been sitting in the hot buffet too long
112,Isabelle,2023-12-23,Ok Location Heating didn‚Äôt work. G Hotel provided heater and blanket Fan stayed on all night - noisy Restaurant staff were not very engaging - sit anywhere and no more info about where items were or how breakfast service worked.
113,Jonathan,2023-12-20,Very good Very good location That the central heat was not working
114,Ian,2023-12-18,Very good Room good How cold breakfast area was and no direction to what was on offer coffee for example was not same place as food.
115,Lesley,2023-12-18,Very good The room was very clean and comfortable People standing round the main door smoking. Breakfast was cold. And to far from the town if walking. As my sister had difficultys.
116,Leo,2023-12-18,"Superb staff and good location. All staff were pleasant. The lady on reception when we arrived was particularly helpful on several occasions. The hotel location was ideal for us, being a very short walk from the station and close to a music venue we had tickets for. Bars and eateries close by too. This was not exactly a big problem or dislike, but it would have been nice to have an electrical socket on both sides of the bed."
117,Gabriel,2023-12-17,"Clean, comfortable, value for money. Comfortable and clean. Easy to get to from the venue of the wedding we attended. Light in room didn't seem to work but had lamps so didn't bother us."

119,Joanne,2023-12-15,"Lovely Bar/restaurant is lovely, it‚Äôs open plan, the lovely big windows. The entrance is light and airy and smells lovely. All the staff were great and extremely helpful Would defo stay again."
120,Lauren,2023-12-15,A good place to stay with friendly & welcoming staff All staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast spread was good and food quality was perfect. Our room & bathroom were both clean but very small. Room and bathroom size were small
121,David,2023-12-14,Good  The bar & restaurant was closed both nights
122,Fatima,2023-12-13,"Excellent hotel for city breaks. Excellent location near city centre, places of interest and transports. The toilet is too small."
123,Megan,2023-12-10,"Easy The staff were really helpful. Comfy beds, lovely breakfast No issues"
124,Kate,2023-12-10,"Good Lovely helpful staff, generally good breakfast Rooms too hot even with AC. Porridge was absolutely vile"
125,Heather,2023-12-09,"Good Location is good üëç Private function on so no restaurant or bar. They had a table to order drinks in reception but nowhere to sit. No discount for reduced service. Bed was not comfortable, no coffee in room or water."
126,Michael,2023-12-08,"Superb close to a venue for a concert parking was x10 the price of any parking locations nearby and there's a lot , you expect a mark up but x10 is robbery"
127,Melina,2023-12-06,"Very good The staff was friendly and I generally liked the room. The breakfast buffet offered the perfect start to the day! It was a bit cold in the room. I used the AC as recommended and put it on the hottest temperature, but it was still quite cold and didn't seem to work well (it was a freezing day outside as well)."
128,John,2023-12-05,Very good Location Breakfast . The bacon and sausage wasn't very nice
129,Christine,2023-12-04,Pleasant clean place with very nice staff in an excellent location Location is excellent Expensive ‚Ä¶ lunches very expensive
130,Lisa,2023-12-03,"Family visit Location, comfortable rooms, friendly staff Limited parking..."
131,Kenneth,2023-11-28,"Good but air con needs sorting out Very close to town, staff very good Our first room the air con did not work, our next room it worked but not very well"
132,Dey,2023-11-28,very enjoyable The hole time was good had a lovely evening with my Grand children and then attended his Graduation we thought the price of the meal and drinks were a bit high
133,Emma,2023-11-27,"Ok for short stay Handy location, short walk from the station and to the centre. Staff were friendly and helpful. Small room and bathroom, bed was a bit hard. Seemed more like a travel Inn than a Hilton hotel. Expensive considering size and basic nature of the room (even though it was a Queen room apparently). Breakfast area seemed a bit chaotic and rowdy."
134,Julie,2023-11-27,"Superb The staff were exceptional at this hotel, especially Peter on reception. Great location too!"
135,Hilary,2023-11-24,Superb View of the park I would like a coat hook near the room door.
136,Jean,2023-11-23,Four of us had a short but very enjoyable stay and would certainly return whenever we are in Bristol The room was a little small and the bathroom very small. However they included everything necessary and were very clean so nothing to complain about. The breakfast was excellent especially the offer of omelettes and poached eggs to order. A special mention must be made of Ash (Subash?). He went out of his way to ensure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Exceptional employee. Small size of bathroom but it did have a great magnified mirror. Not enough comfortable chairs in the bar area.
137,Richard,2023-11-22,I‚Äôd book again Location and value Prefer bath to showers
138,Paul,2023-11-21,"Overall very happy with our stay. Staff very helpful and friendly Breakfast choice/omelettes Clean Close to station /park Free overnight parking close by Bed size, previously stayed in room with bigger bed"
139,Andrew,2023-11-20,"Pleasant, fair price Clean, comfortable room. Staff changed our room when the temperature in the original one couldn't be reduced. Breakfast good. Very friendly and helpful staff. Not possible to reduce temperature in original room."
140,Jeannette,2023-11-20,"Comfortable hotel best suited for business travellers I stayed one night for business. The room was fine, clean and comfortable, with tea making facilities in the room. Great breakfast selection and very welcoming staff. Although perfectly comfortable, the room was very beige, with almost office-like furniture. Good for a business trip, but for a leisure visit I would expect more for the price. The location is not very inspiring, but near the station, which suited my needs."
141,Alan,2023-11-20,Good Location and staff
142,Penny,2023-11-19,"Comfortable, pleasant staff, good breakfast Near to the station, contemporary decor (lovely smell in the reception areas!), pleasant staff and great breakfast. Breakfast layout rather confusing and lots of items had run out"
143,Dawn,2023-11-19,Good The hotel is in a good location near the station and a short walk into the center of Bristol. The room was clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was very good. The staff were helpful and friendly.
144,Eddie-e,2023-11-19,Bristol bomboolash Good location near station. 10 mins walk into town. Easy check in. Nothing
145,Adele,2023-11-19,Great location for city break It was a good location close to old town and harbour with parking
146,Julie,2023-11-17,"Great location, Great breakfast The smell of the hotel was fabulous. there was an atomiser near the lift. smelt gorgeous. Staff were friendly and helpful Location was perfect. The waffle maker for breakfast was brilliant. nom The view from our window was probably the worst we've ever had. building work and scaffolding to building next door. was a shame, but unavoidable. didn't detract from room particularly as was just a place to rest our heads. The coffee machine wasn't working so couldn't easily get a cuppa, then another, as a member of staff had to work the only hot drink machine behind the bar"
147,Colin,2023-11-16,"Overall a positive experience, spoiled only by inattentive breakfast staff The check-in and check-out were very smooth and the gentlemen on reception was extremely helpful and efficient. Room was perfect for what I needed, very clean and comfortable, and the location of the hotel was perfect for my needs. Car parking was also very handy and worked well. Long wait to get a table for breakfast - not because of the lack of tables, but because there was nobody there to attend to the waiting guests. Empty tables were not being cleared and re-set, so when someone did finally take me to a table, I had to wait again while the table was cleared and re-set. The person doing that did not seem to recognise that a lot of people were waiting and did not seem to be in a hurry to get fresh tables ready. For a hotel of this category, I would have expected a lot more."
148,H,2023-11-13,Long weekend in Bristol. It was a short walk to the centre of Bristol. The noise from possibly the lift mechanism or air conditioning unit. We were on the 5th floor next to the elevators.
149,David,2023-11-13,Just the job Room was fine. Location excellent for town and railway station Breakfast was good Nothing
150,Em,2023-11-13,"Perfect for visiting the city Great location and parking Staff were superb. Friendly helpful and food in restaurant, room service and breakfast was great too. Bed was hard for me and also heating didn‚Äôt work but we managed to get a heater and extra duvet easily and sorted that out."
151,Dan,2023-11-13,"A good venue, with all what was needed, giving a good base for a quick visit. The location was good, friendly staff, convenient bar. Breakfast was decent too. Initially the wrong room was provided; with a double bed instead of 2 singles provided, but this was resolved, although mainly by my colleagues' quick thinking."
152,Tracy,2023-11-12,Good hotel. The reception staff were brilliant. So helpful and cheerful. Our Queen Room was beside the lift shaft so was really noisy 24 hours a day which was very annoying. Shower room as tiny.
153,Paula,2023-11-12,"Expensive for what it offers The bedroom is spacious and bright. The toilet has good amenities and lighting. It is good located not too far from the train station. The staff is really friendly and helpful The breakfast is simple and quite depressing. Most of the itens were missing, like pastries and fruits. There were no charcuteries, the bread was old and poor quality. The coffee was decent though"
154,Kai,2023-11-11,"Great stay! Friendly reception staff, quick and easy check in Friendly breakfast catering staff members, decent selection for breakfast Good room size Non-smart TV"
155,Val,2023-11-09,Comfortable hotel but some breakfast chaos. The property had big rooms and was clean. There were also two decent chairs to sit and watch the TV etc. The breakfast was okay but the tables were often not cleared for new diners and the food stocks had to be asked to replenished but weren‚Äôt.
156,Conrad,2023-11-09,Very good The breakfast was good No information about the local area in the room and a paper menu in the room would have helped.not everyone has a smart phone to scan barcodes
157,Terence,2023-11-08,"Convenient and comfortable. A good overnight stop. The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel itself was smart and quite conveniently located for walking to the old town. Breakfast was decent, if unexceptional and the price was good. A good option for an overnight stay in Bristol The hotel could have provided much more helpful information in advance: 1) Access to the hotel by car is complicated (not helped by road works/construction and Google maps thinking you can turn left off Temple Gate where you can't). Last time I stayed in Bristol, the hotel provided detailed driving directions for accessing it from various different directions - something similar would have been helpful. 2) The only information I had from the hotel about parking talked about an option for ¬£20 a day. They omitted to mention the alternative car park 20 seconds walk away that is free overnight, and ¬£2.50 an hour for up to 4 hours. The staff mentioned it, but only when I asked about alternatives if the hotel car park was full."
158,Ruby,2023-11-07,"Superb Really friendly staff, rooms were really nice with lots of storage Breakfast was unorganised. Me and my partner were sat flipped the ‚Äòoccupied‚Äô counter provided with the table to get food only to come back to have to ask a couple to move after they‚Äôd been sat at our table by staff."
159,John,2023-11-06,"Excellent Clean, good staff, good value Coffee machine"
160,Michelle,2023-11-06,"Pleasant The breakfast was okay, short on cups and cutlery, had to ask for items. I think they need the check in for breakfast nearer the door, it was so busy people was just walking in and not queuing to be seated and helping them selves to breakfast, these could have been people whose not paid as they didn‚Äôt give a room number."
161,Andrea,2023-11-06,Superb Very comfortable Great breakfast included in the price Lovely staff Car park a little pricey
162,Rosie,2023-11-05,"Superb Convenient location, comfortable room, everyone working there was lovely, and great breakfast."
163,James,2023-11-05,"Pleasant overnight stay and made our journey easier for travelling to Devon. Breakfast was fine, as well as being located beside historic church building and some old public houses from a few hundred years. A difference in the air between the front and back of building. I thought hotel was not near the train station as we needed to get taxi to and from."
164,Sally,2023-11-05,Was fit for purpose for a one night stay but wouldn't return if there are other options. Location was handy for the train station. Nice touches in the room like a bath mat all the soaps and gels and fridge. Room was spacious bed was comfortable. It wasn't as modern as would have expected for a Hilton; there was a huge stain on the upholstered desk chair; stains all over the carpets and curtains too. Tea tray was okay but not exciting with no biscuits or fresh milk considering there was a fridge. And I hated having just a QR code for hotel information rather than some paper I could read and keep refer back to. TV half the channels didn't even work and guide was awful.
165,Naomi,2023-11-05,"Overall an excellent stopover. Staff extremely friendly, all very pleasant. Nice breakfast. Pillows far too soft."
166,Stephen,2023-11-04,Very good . .
167,Nicholas,2023-11-03,"Close to the rail station, not far from the cultural centre by the docks, excellent for short stay comfortable clean room, the heating system wasn't working adequately but we were provided with a supplementary heater, very good breakfast Everything was either adequate or good, no comnplaints"
168,Ioannis,2023-11-02,"Well located. Friendly staff. Nice rooms Well located, very close to the train station. The room was clean and well-sized with comfortable bed. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Nothing in particular. Maybe slightly overpriced but it‚Äôs pretty common lately due to the energy crisis."
169,Sivadnaj,2023-10-31,"Very good but could be even better Very comfortable, no fuss hotel. Helpful staff. Good location for Temple Meads rail station and useful bus connections. Good buffet breakfast. Enjoyed the fitness centre, especially Peloton. The air conditioning was not very responsive. We had to open the small windows to get some air flow and cool the room but then we had traffic noise from the road. The air con fan was too loud to have on for any length of time. Nowhere to hang damp towels to dry."
170,Callum,2023-10-31,"Central location and hearty breakfast. Great breakfast included in stay, clean good sized rooms. Car parking pricing at ¬£20/night, but good to have the option."
171,Karen,2023-10-31,Great location for Bristol city centre and attractions Great location for the city centre. Easy access to the station on foot and walking distance from the main Bristol attractions.
172,Kry≈°tof,2023-10-30,"Superb You get what you expect. Nice and clean hotel with good breakfast and nice staff. Kinda expensive, but worth it."
173,Vant,2023-10-30,"Not as good as a premiere inn staff were really friendly, no usb in the rooms which were a tad dated"
174,Tony,2023-10-30,"Good Good location, price, breakfast, clean and bright hotel No functioning air conditioning in very hot room and no alternative rooms available, no parking availability at hotel due to road closure with no prior warning to guests"
175,Joanne,2023-10-29,Superb Great location and welcoming staff.
176,Joanna,2023-10-27,"Convenient, clean and friendly Nice clean comfy room and great breakfast. Convenient location and good price."
177,Lee,2023-10-26,"Great hotel but lacking info on car park access. Nicely appointed room - did not look tired at all. Not too busy at breakfast. Good central location. Car park is visible along the main road, from which there is no entrance. Surrounding road system affords no real time to stop and think how to get into the car park. Clearer instructions with a postcode to the rear of the hotel would help."
178,Vicky,2023-10-25,Perfect base for exploring Bristol Fab location. Very comfortable room. Excellent choice at the breakfast buffet.
179,Mark,2023-10-25,I would choose this hotel again for sure. Nice welcome and quality of breakfast. Well thought out room arrangements to squeeze as much as possible into the small space.
180,Joanne,2023-10-25,"Great location, great staff unfortuantely let down by a disturbed nights sleep. The room was good and the staff were excellent - particularly the staff in the restaurant who were very conscientious with our dietary requirements. Our tv turned on at full volume at 04.29 in the morning. This may have been some preset alarm setup by a previous occupant but clearly not ideal. If this is an option it would be useful to either turn it off or have the staff reset it each time the room is vacated."
181,Brian,2023-10-22,Good  Parking payment. No free breakfast
182,Nigel,2023-10-21,Good Handy for the train station and city centre Small room and expensive
183,Titilia,2023-10-20,"Location was convenient and was clean Location and how clean it was The mattress was uncomfortable, spring bed and not levelled."
184,Giacomo,2023-10-20,Good Great breakfast
185,Bob,2023-10-20,"Friendly and Polite staff with an excellent welcome factor. Good size room and excellent facilities, very comfortable bed. Ideal location as I travelled by train and the venue for my function was only 5 minutes walk. Not so good walking back late night through the park opposite as there was a distinctive smell of cannabis, would have taken a different route if known but the times we live in, I guess. I felt that the price was high as the hotel only really compared to other cheaper chain hotels. Yes, the restaurant was better but was only used it for a quick buffet breakfast as I was in Bristol for a function. Speaking with other people met at the function I would look elsewhere if visiting Bristol again as they appeared to get a better deal financially."
186,Dawn,2023-10-18,"Very enjoyable Good breakfast, nice staff. Good location. We got lost on the way from the train station, on foot, and ended up going the back way round a lot of building works. Then discovered how close it was to the station the next day."
187,Katherine,2023-10-18,"A very nice place to stay at a reasonable price. Well designed room, clean, nice controllable temperature, comfortable bed, well lit bathroom, very good breakfast, good location. The rooms at the back overlook a park. Nothing really."
188,Pauline,2023-10-16,"Excellent We found the staff so helpful and friendly. In particular, we had an issue with our booking which Peter resolved beyond our expectations. Location was also excellent. The bed was a bit too firm."
189,Christopher,2023-10-16,A very enjoyable and comfortable stay. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Car parking at the hotel is a bit expensive.
190,Jennifer,2023-10-15,Very good Easy to locate near the train station and tourist areas. Very welcoming and knowledgeable reception person. Large comfortable bed. Room good size. Decor pleasing. Large coffee cups. Lift
191,Elaine,2023-10-14,Peter Front of House made our trip as did the Restaurant staff .. loved the access to Temple Gardens The rooms overlooking the road
192,Chan,2023-10-14,"Superb Totally good, I like it"
193,Michael,2023-10-13,Very good good location between train and city centre temperature in restaurant- aggressive aircon
194,Philip,2023-10-11,Very pleasant (hope this counts as a sentence). Staff explaining breakfast procedure to me as new Hilton customer. Having a biscuit with the teamaker (!).
195,Elizabeth,2023-10-10,"Superb Good location, great breakfast, helpful staff, clean room, comfortable beds."
196,Katixa,2023-10-09,"Quiet and comfortable stay Comfortable, quiet, nice bed and desk. Friendly staff. Really close to the railway station. More fresh fruit at the breakfast buffet please!"
197,Mark,2023-10-09,"Great stay , very poor breakfast though Everything about it was great to be honest, expect the breakfast was very poor The breakfast was very poor quality, the bacon was cold, greasy and rock hard, the mushrooms were dried up, the scrambled egg was all dried up, and sausages were cold, all in all very poor standard"
198,Joe,2023-10-07,"Necessary Welcome good, comfortable clean room. No biscuits and after a long Fri e could ha e done with one Think overpriced for the one night Pricing not value formoney"
199,Ellen,2023-10-05,Comfortable stay. Quite central. Easy to reach city centre and Temple Mead Rail Station. Nice Temple Garden to Victoria Street. Love the Clean fresh Bath Towels and Bed very comfortable. Room Brightly lit. Ample Coffee and Tea given in room . Room a bit small. The fridge not working. Shower door cannot close properly.
200,Guillaume,2023-10-02,"Very good It is a nice hotel in the city centre. Breakfast was good but basic (nothing extravagant, the bread was good though, coffee could be better). We really appreciate the fact that it provide parking possibilities. The staff was friendly and happy to help if needed"
201,Kay,2023-10-02,"Well located with easy parking and good value Parking is very handy, quiet room, breakfast was very good. Queen sized bed was rather small but King-size are available"
202,Michelle,2023-10-02,A good stay Staff were amazing. hotel was clean. The mattress was very hard and uncomfortable
203,Della,2023-09-30,Very good Location Nothing - all good
204,Basak,2023-09-28,"Good Very helpful staff, very clean room Construction view really uncomfortable could not open my curtains for the entire stay. Restaurant was always super busy whenever i was there breakfast and dinner."
205,Stephanie,2023-09-27,Nice hotel Great location near the train station. Staff were friendly Wasn't there long enough. No issues
206,Amy,2023-09-25,"Very good Excellent price and location, modern hotel, clean room and comfortable bed. Not the most welcoming on arrival at lunchtime. I expected more from a Hilton hotel."
207,Guy,2023-09-24,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
208,Jan,2023-09-22,"Very good Room comfortable & excellent breakfast. Also handy for places of interest, shops etc. Tricky to find hotel car park as lots of construction work going on but obviously not fault of hotel."
209,Ana,2023-09-20,"Very good Super helpful staff. Great breakfast. Perfect location, in between the train station and the city center. Comfortable bed. It's a bit old and outdated, but it's still comfortable. The carpet floors always look a bit dirty, but that's normal in UK."
210,Karys,2023-09-19,Just right for the purpose of my trip. The room was spacious and comfy and the bathroom was clean and functional (I liked the fact there was a proper shower rather than an over the bath shower). The location was a 2 minute walk from my work venue and the variety at breakfast was reasonable. The staff were excellent. The hotel is in quite a noisy part of Bristol - perhaps some extra sound proofing in rooms would be good as I was woken several times by traffic and other guests just entering/exiting rooms/ the sound of the lift pinging.
211,Lynn,2023-09-19,Superb Modern clean hotel in business district Cafes and pubs close by A little way out from city centre but bus stop is outside the hotel and the water ferry is a short walk away
212,Orkun,2023-09-18,"Very good stay Staff was very helpful, breakfast was ok, they have gluten free option. Nothing"
213,Camilla,2023-09-18,Hilton is Hilton The service Nothing
214,Ana,2023-09-18,It was good - too expensive though for one night Pleasant space overall . Hilton chain best beds ‚Ä¶ Noisy location. Ambulance sirens main dual carriage way .
215,Flo,2023-09-17,"Comfortable affordable hotel in central bristol Central location, near the train station, comfortable bed and good Buffett breakfast No complaints"
216,Mandy,2023-09-17,Very good  There was building work very close which closed the road leading to the Hilton car park. Took us 20 minutes to find another way in and had to ask in the end. The hotel need to advise guests in advance of easier ways to access the car park whilst the building continues. In fact the whole of Bristol is a building site.
217,Sascha,2023-09-15,"Great location for a business trip to Bristol I had a wonderful stay. The room was big enough for one person and everything was very clean. The bed was comfortable and the walls are not as paper-thin as in many other hotels. I enjoyed the breakfast as well. Although the gym was relatively small, all equipment worked and was clean. Nothing really."
218,Dafni14k,2023-09-13,"Very good The room was very clean, the personnel was very polite and helpful. The location is a great walking distance from the main train station. There was a constant noise in the room and it felt like they were doing constructions from outside, which was not the case. The room temperature couldn't be adjusted so we woke up with a cold. At the entrance, there was a very strong scent/perfume and accelerated our cold :("
219,Barbara,2023-09-11,Exceptional service from all staff members. Reception staff very helpful at check in and check out. Restaurant staff also give great service. Room rather small but clean and adequate. Room smaller than expected.
220,Desmond,2023-09-09,Lovely stay Very well located
221,Mary,2023-09-08,I wish it was longer had to leave personal problems üòû I only stayed in the room for 2 hours I had to leave family problems ü•∫ Everything was lovely
222,Etches,2023-09-03,"Very good Great location for purpose of visit (nearby wedding). Room had a wetroom - brilliant! The seat within the shower are was dirty, in between its slats. I know it's difficult - but cooked breakfast items were cold!"
223,Lydia,2023-09-03,"Great location, clean and comfortable. Good breakfast and great value for money Everything was great! Nothing"
224,Diane,2023-09-03,Excellent choice for access to airport and city centre. Very good customer service - warm friendly staff. Modern comfortable room with very friendly staff. Room overlooking gardens and old monastery very pleasant. Very convenient for the airport bus!! Breakfast is well worth the money. Nothing to dislike
225,Neil,2023-09-01,Very good Nice Car park charge
226,Jessica,2023-08-31,Good How walkable the distance was from the station and softness of bed and cushions Shower went cold quite easily when used late in the morning.
227,Ahu,2023-08-31,"Very good... Great location, private car park, clean room, delicious breakfast, etc... Staying at Hilton is always a good idea..."
228,Duncan,2023-08-31,Superb near train and Wetherspoons Knights Temple. Busses handy. staff helpful thanks. no non-slip patch in bath under the shower.
229,Nicola,2023-08-31,"Friendly staff, great breakfast Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was nice. Cost of parking was a little excessive. Forgot to ensure there was no feather duvets or pillows in the rooms. However, this was soon rectified and we were given a drink as compensation."
230,Ian,2023-08-30,"Despite the problems accessing the hotel and parking the car, the hotel itself was very good. Staff were very friendly. Very good breakfast. I spent 30 minutes going around in cirlces trying to find the way into the hotel car park to get to reception. In the end I had to drop my wife off to go to the hotel on foot and then make 2 turnings that I was not supposed to make. On arrival it was explained that I should have gone through the archaway marked ""Novotel Car Park Only"". Easier access and plentiful, clear direction signs need to be provided. Parking was difficult due to the limited spaces in the hotel, so I had to park in the council car park and then pay a charge by 8am next morning, until a space became available in the hotel car park (¬£20 for 24 hours). Not a great system!"
231,Nicola,2023-08-29,"Good stay Location of hotel is good. The breakfast tables were not cleared quick enough. we were told to find a table and there were not any clean ones, we had to ask for them to be cleared."
232,Ellie,2023-08-29,"Very enjoyable, would stay again. Clean room, comfy bed, very nice bathroom Would be nice to see some biscuits/ snacks on the tea tray."
233,√Ågnes,2023-08-29,Superb The breakfast was very nice with a good range of options and the receptionist welcoming me was very kind.
234,Siu,2023-08-29,A good and convenient hotel The location was convenient. The breakfast was good. it would be better if the double room could be providedwuth two chairs instead of one .
235,Mumdooh,2023-08-29,"fascinating Liked the location, breakfast and staff prompt response. I had an issue relating to Air conditioner in my room at late night, But a big thanks to Sasha from the reception team who instantaneously organized a replacement room and moved me into a new room. Although the hotel has a car park, the spaces seem limited. To me that was a thing but anyone who doesn‚Äôt think this as issue wouldn‚Äôt be bothered."
236,Th√πy,2023-08-29,"We have a pleasant stay. We will return if the chance arises. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, so it's easy for us to go to the centre of the city. It's rather close to the train station as well. We arrived at Bristol by train, and it took us about 5~7 minutes to walk to the hotel (with our heavy luggage behind). We didn't try the breakfast, but we had dinner at the hotel restaurant. The atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant, and the food is good (we ordered some hot soup, salad, and Buffalo wings). I would like to compliment the ones who cleaned our room for treating my plushie with care. The room is small, but with this affordable price, it's good enough. I have one complaint about the fridge in our room. We weren't sure if the fridge was working or broken, but it wasn't cold enough to store our ice cream and yoghurt. I hope that it will be fixed or improved."
237,Shannon,2023-08-29,"Good Location was great, 6min walk from the station and tesco express nearby. Room was lovely and the staff made towel swans which was a nice touch. Great value for money and would definitely stay again. The breakfast wasn‚Äôt great- sausages and bacon seemed like they had been out for a a while."
238,Rabia,2023-08-28,Lovely place and great breakfast Lovely breakfast with a large selection of food and even a waffle making machine to make fresh waffles with a range of toppings. Can request eggs how you like them cooked and can request veggie option sausages too for breakfast. Staff was very friendly and very helpful so a BIG THANK YOU! Shower was amazing with lovely soaps and body lotions
239,David,2023-08-27,A good location and price for my short visit. Location and room were good for my brief visit Some areas of the hotel need improvement but generally good value.
240,Maire,2023-08-27,"Ideal location for a short break in Bristol. The location of this hotel is ideal, a few minutes walking distance from both Temple Meads Bus/Train Station and the city centre. A very good breakfast is served, with plenty of choices. We were able to leave our luggage at reception on the morning of our departure and collect it that evening as we had a late flight. Nothing."
241,Justin,2023-08-27,"very pleasant short stay comfortable room, good location"
242,Andrea,2023-08-27,"Better than expected stay & good value off-weekend The staff at checkin were very friendly, and gave me a room that I asked for facing the garden. Thus my room was nice and quiet, with negligible from traffic noise until after 7am. The bed is comfortable and it's great to have both a kettle and a mini fridge. The included breakfast was very good, with nicely cooked poached eggs to order. The location is very convenient both for the railway station but also lovely walks along the Harbour area. Only tiny things were an annoyance: even when off there is a low hum from the air conditioning and the room could do with more plugs at the bedside for charging phones and other equipment. Finally, it would be nice to have a better assortment of herbal tea bags, such as chamomile and peppermint, rather than predominantly regular tea"
243,Nicole,2023-08-26,"perfect for a night to stay, if for more days, I would prefer to have a place more quiet great breakfast choices, clean and comfy room location was okay, but the noise of the street/cars were a little anoying"
244,Tess,2023-08-26,Very good  lack of parking
245,Jamey,2023-08-25,Great hotel for a city break. The location was a 5 minute walk from the railway station. Pedestrian friendly. Check-in was speedy and efficient. A special mention for Nikita who checked us in and was more then helpful with the choice of room. The hotel was 10minutes walk away form the Old Town. Lots of history and great bars and eateries. So much to choose from. Breakfast was self service and plentiful with a good selection of food. Our room was small but very comfortable. More Tea Bags in the room.
246,Ionut,2023-08-24,"Outstanding staff, thank you everyone. Owners could invest in some renovations The staff was the best thing about the location. Everyone was so accommodating and friendly. Peter stood out, he‚Äôs a manager or boss or something, and he‚Äôs leading by example. Also, the food was outstanding. The chicken and rice dish was amazing, don‚Äôt remember the name of it. Not to be attributed to the staff, but the hotel could use some renovations. I imagine that‚Äôs up to the owners. There‚Äôs a particular smell throughout the hallway, but the room was excellent and clean. The furniture is not amazing, as it‚Äôs a bit older, but the cleaning staff did their job very well."
247,Graham,2023-08-24,Value for money Parking is awful. You allow people to park in no parking zones
248,David,2023-08-24,"Ship-shape and Bristol fashion! This is a modern hotel with everything that you‚Äôd expect. The bed was spacious and extremely comfortable, breakfast in the morning had a very good selection, and all of the staff that we interacted with were helpful and friendly, especially Annie(?) at the front desk. A late check-out and storage of bags were offered, rather than asked for. Good city location near Temple Meads, but, that also means you‚Äôre close to a busy road."
249,Elaine,2023-08-21,"Air conditioning in room didn‚Äôt work, although we were offered a fan it was very hot and we couldn‚Äôt have the window ope Good location for rail link, good breakfast Not close to amenities"
250,Eve,2023-08-21,Bad management Good breakfast. Clean room with comfy beds. My son was locked in his room after the door failed to open from inside. It took over an hour as we were told we would have to wait for a locksmith to arrive. The staff on reception were useless and most unhelpful given the circumstances as was the hotel manager when we asked for an explanation for how this could happen. He never even apologised! Very disappointing in terms of health and safety..
251,Karen,2023-08-20,"Superb Very Central, everything In walking distance"
252,Jimmy,2023-08-19,perfect location for a relaxing quiet city break the room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was good quality but the notable point for me was the friendliness of the staff who were very obliging also there is a nice small park across the road and the hotel is walking distance from temple meads train station where the airport flyer bus stops all good
253,Amie,2023-08-19,Europe travelling. Great location. Clean and comfortable room.
254,Amira,2023-08-18,Perfect for a short stay East central location with onsite parking (although you have to pay for it) Small fridge
255,Ruth,2023-08-18,Good  Xarpet was badly stained in bedroom
256,Albert,2023-08-18,Just what I wanted It‚Äôs location Cost of parking
257,Clive,2023-08-17,"Good time with young and old. Easy walking distance from the train station, even for my elderly parents. Also, many walkable places to visit. We went to Bath by train for a day out too. The room was a little warm for me and the AC didn't cool it enough."
258,Evans,2023-08-17,"Excellent Reasonable room with functional bathroom and shower. Position, easy walk into the city centre."
259,Ward,2023-08-17,Very good N/a N/a
260,Ann,2023-08-15,"Very good. Breakfast was good thanks. I'm gluten intolerant, the staff were helpful in providing me with toast & cereal which I don't often find in other hotels or bnbs. Not enough decaffeinated tea bags in room. Shower was. Not easy to regulate, either too hot or cold."
261,Rosemary,2023-08-14,"Good overnight stop for the airport. Good location for Airport Flyer bus from Temple Meads station to airport. Clean room, bed a little hard, very quiet. Dinner limited menu but satisfactory, breakfast good choice but cooked food tepid."
262,Andrew,2023-08-14,Nice clean hotel would stay again. Good clean hotel good selection for breakfast. Rooms abit small especially the bathroom.
263,Stuart,2023-08-14,"Very good Nice walk to the centre and river, good breakfast, excellent Sardinian restaurant a short stroll across the square Room not the biggest"
264,Mark,2023-08-13,"We would stay again Great location, comfortable room. Trying to find the entrance to the carpark was very difficult due to current roadworks, so new temporary signage is desperately required. Breakfast food quality wasn‚Äôt great."
265,Joan,2023-08-13,Good value and comfortable. Very welcoming and helpful staff. Short walk from the station. Although the breakfast was well prepared and presented the quality of the ingredients didn‚Äôt match the Hilton of old.
266,Pauline,2023-08-13,"Convenient for trains and buses, sadly wouldn‚Äôt stay again Very clean Chair with broken arms (dangerous) in room Absolutely NO info in room, eg restaurant menu, breakfast times etc Restaurant not busy but we didn‚Äôt get our starter! Extortionate price for tiny bottle of tonic water ¬£3.35!"
267,Lorraine,2023-08-13,Fine.  No complimentary water in the room.
268,Tim,2023-08-09,"Simply great Friendly staff, although the chef at breakfast came across a little bit annoyed when I made a small and honest mistake like I‚Äôm some sort of child. Seems like a nice guy though, but he could have handled that better. The hotel was close to the station which makes it easy to get to another place and back. The location is nice and the price is the best amongst all competition. The breakfast was nice, lots of options, but in my opinion also a bit simple. All in all it‚Äôs very much worth your money, I‚Äôve enjoyed it very much staying there. If you are just looking for a nice and easy place to stay, this is a great option. But if you want to make your stay a bit more special, maybe go for another hotel. It‚Äôs a little bit of an old hotel, not really modern. Could be charming but you don‚Äôt expect it at Hilton‚Äôs."
269,Brian,2023-08-08,"Positive experience and would book again. Bedroom was a good size with comfortable bed.very clean. All the staff were amazing, so friendly and willing to help. Breakfast was good. Only thing I would have preferred is to have a bath as well as a shower."
270,Malika,2023-08-08,"Returning customer Comfortable rooms, great location. Expensive parking. Restaurant menu limited. Food very average, service rather uneven‚Äô"
271,Pauline,2023-08-08,We felt really comfortable here. It was lovely and clean Nothing
272,David,2023-08-08,"Good value for money, would stay again Room was good value, staff were very helpful when asked anything, breakfast was ok. Breakfast lacked basic continental products,ie no yoghurt, no butter, only flora margarine, no croissants, Also no tomato with the cooked breakfast,slow to replenish the cooked items, so you were waiting with plate in hand with your breakfast going cold,waiting for items to be replenished"
273,Brenda,2023-08-06,"Disappointed The room was clean mostly. The toilet didn't flush properly. Took about 3 or 4 flushes each time. Very noisy from road traffic and seagulls. Parking was expensive. Breakfast was all over the place, couldn't find what I wanted right away. By the time I got coffee, my breakfast was cold."
274,Claire,2023-08-06,"Great location and lovely staff Friendly staff, fridge in room, powerful shower, good location Noise levels from other guests, bathroom too small to dry yourself so had to go into bedroom to do that, too many chairs blocking the room which was fairly small. There was a cracked sink and peeling ceiling in the bathroom. A better variety of tea and coffee making facilities would have been nice for the price. It was very basic and the one teabag I did use tasted like it was very old. The cooked breakfast was not good and the berry juice I had was incredibly sugary. More fresh options would have been better it all felt very cheap on the breakfast front which was a shame as the staff were very nice there"
275,Paul,2023-08-05,"Nice comfortable stay good choice of food and drinks at breakfast and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was in a good location and was very clean with lovely fluffy towels, toiletries. Even had an ironing board and iron available in the room. trying to find the hotel wasn't easy using satnav."
276,Forence,2023-08-05,"Superb Breakfast was lovely. Staff at the Recess were very courteous and efficient. Housekeeping staff very hardworking and good at their job. Love the gym, had basic equipments for workouts. Love that they kept clean towels for use during workout and hydration and sanitation stations. We flew into Bristol at 11am and knew check in was 3pm, the hotel was able to keep our bags for us which was nice. But, when we came back at 3pm, the room wasn't ready and we had to wait for more than 30 minutes."
277,Julie,2023-08-04,"Very good Rooms were nice, good location for shops and train station We had 2 rooms. One room air con was good mother room so hot! But they did bring us a fan which helped hugely"
278,Susan,2023-08-04,"Really enjoyed our stay a great hotel with lovely staff & excellent facilities we would recommend. Location excellent Quiet when indoors Modern facilities Clean Excellent value Friendly, helpful, polite staff Breakfast was plentiful & good quality, the staff in the dining room were exceptional Room was a little small for 2 mature females who need access especially around wardrobe & desk area. We will request a slightly more spacious room next time."
279,Denise,2023-08-01,"Beautiful hotel with friendly and helpful staff Beautiful hotel, smart and clean with good parking facilities. Gentleman on reception was amazing and helpful, wish I could remember his name. Went out of his way to help me with my daughter's graduation. One of the rooms I was given was right next to the lift (didn't get this room until after 9pm) and it was not until my younger daughter had got undressed and ready for bed and switched the air conditioning off that I realised you could hear the lift. It did keep me awake most of the night, but as my daughter was asleep I couldn't wake her up to move. I had asked for quiet rooms away from the lifts and stairs (I had two rooms). Also no tomatoes at breakfast, although everything else was good."
280,Mariana,2023-07-31,"Clean hotel, friendly staff and good location. Good location near Bristol Temple Meads station and clean rooms. Nothing all good."
281,Lily,2023-07-31,Ok Staff were very helpful and friendly. Our aircon didn‚Äôt work we asked but couldn‚Äôt be fixed but we didn‚Äôt get asked if we wanted to move it was very very hot! I asked for a low room due to a knee injury and this wasn‚Äôt taking in I even reminded them on arrival. We were second floor and I had to walk half way down the hallway. There was loose nails/carpet tacks? Not sure what‚Äôs they are called between bathroom and bedroom and I cut my feet multiple times. Glasses weren‚Äôt clean fridge wasn‚Äôt cold.
282,David,2023-07-30,"Very good, great location and very quiet in the rooms despite being very busy Very clean room And bathroom, the Egyptian cotton towels were exceptionally soft and white. Breakfast was fantastic with a huge selection of food types and the coffee was superb. It‚Äôs a very busy hotel so obviously gets a lots of wear and tear. The paintwork And woodwork is starting to show sign a of this but nothing untoward‚Ä¶ One thing that does need addressing is the way all the dirty linens and towels Are Left on corridors way after cleaning times and into the evening. Looks Unsightly and is actually a bit of a hazard."
283,Gemma,2023-07-30,Perfect Everything Couldn‚Äôt find so had to call. No food late in evening.
284,Eleonor,2023-07-29,Good The mirrors and bathroom

286,Cheng,2023-07-26,Good The room is really clean and the staff are super friendly.
287,Valerie,2023-07-24,"OK, pleasant enough, but not memorable. Location was handy for the station and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. Breakfast was OK, but a little underwhelming. Generally felt we could have done a bit better at a Premier Inn."
288,Amorelle,2023-07-23,Bristol stopover Proximity. Lovely staff. When I booked it said I‚Äôd been upgraded but that didn‚Äôt seem to be the case as room was nice but quite basic. Bathroom small. I paid ¬£159 and on day the cost was much cheaper on booking.com.
289,Anna,2023-07-23,A very corporate hotel Nothing stood out Nothing stood out
290,Tina,2023-07-23,Good for 1 night Well equipped. Lovely soft pillows. Good choice at breakfast. They will make your eggs how you like.. I had an incredible omlette! Very strong smell of aftershave scented air freshener in lifts and corrdors etc. Breakfast area very spread out and un-cordinated. Waffle maker not working (but other choices available).
291,Stephanie,2023-07-22,"Loved the location but hotel very impersonal Location and comfortable Drinks in bar very expensive, food very average"
292,Dominic,2023-07-22,Great Very pleasant receptionists Fresh coffee at breakfast would be nice the machine coffee was awful
293,Nicholas,2023-07-21,Great location Location Breakfast poor over cooked
294,Evans,2023-07-20,"Reasonable, comfortable well positioned hotel. Reasonable room good location and if you manage to get a car parking spot it is helpful and a lot cheaper than most other car parks. You cannot book a car park spot in advance. The Bar area was not great. Lifts got very busy at peak times so we walked to our room."
295,Jennie,2023-07-20,"Perfect Superb room, very clean and in good condition. Very quiet despite being in the City centre. Very comfy bed with good quality linen and thick towels."
296,Laura,2023-07-18,Good Location great Parking ok.... paid car park very close as limited spaces at actual hotel Staff friendly and helpful Room very clean Breakfast very average Bed not very comfortable
297,Jonathan,2023-07-17,Very good  I‚Äôd prefer a different way to pay for parking. ¬£20 for 24 hours but only parked overnight. Either charge per night or allow partial payment
298,Patrick,2023-07-17,Very good Waited 15min for a table
299,Jenny,2023-07-16,"Excellent hotel Clean, comfortable rooms, excellent breakfast, great staff and lovely bar Rooms are very small"

301,Adam,2023-07-16,"Very good Perfectly located for the train station amd city centre, clean amd efficient as always. We have stayed here a few times before and will do again!"
302,Portia,2023-07-13,Very good Great location and very clean. Room was a good size and had a lovely view. Bathroom too small and sink was way too close to the shower. There was also no plug socket on one side of the bed.
303,Stephen,2023-07-12,"Bristol Weekend Location was very good and Hotel facilities very good. Helpful friendly staff. Breakfast seating, had to wait for 15 minutes for table , arrived around 9.30. Staff though were helpful and kept us informed about the table availability."
304,D,2023-07-11,All good. No Complaints at all. No complaints at all. Perfect for 1 night in Bristol. Thanks.
305,Anita,2023-07-10,"Basic but decent night's stay Good location. Right by the park and ride stop, which was very convenient and much cheaper and better than paying the onsite parking fee. Breakfast very nice. Staff friendly and helpful. Hotel clean but felt very basic. Twin beds not full size, narrow and uncomfortable. Just a king bed unzipped, which we had to wait for despite booking and checking via unanswered messages. Small and basic bathroom. Small and very basic reception area. I did expect more from a Hilton Hotel, to be honest."
306,Angela,2023-07-09,"It was a very good stay so frustrating that we were charged twice by the restaurant. It was comfortable, clean and convenient to the station. The restaurant charged our bank account twice for one meal which is frustrating when travelling."
307,Susan,2023-07-07,Good location and facilities. Convenient location and quiet Long queue to check in and inability to reserve parking space. Plus car covered in tree sap.
308,Evans,2023-07-06,Good Location was very good.
309,Im,2023-07-03,"Good Easy walking distance from Bristol Temple Meads, which was very handy when arriving late at night after a flight from Belfast. Breakfast was pretty solid; it was a rather cold morning, so the porridge was very welcome."
310,Helen,2023-07-03,Very good Room great size and bathroom very clean. Breakfast was good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. A/C was noisy and couldn't turn it off. The tv didn't work and there were no rooms to move to
311,Lorenzo,2023-07-02,"Affordable but high quality of stay. Location, breakfast."
312,Anthony,2023-06-30,"Very nice location and enjoyable stay in Bristol The staff were very helpful. Rooms were clean. Location was quiet. The breakfast was good with a nice selection. It is easy to walk to the city centre & river. Car parking was useful albeit limited spaces & ¬£20:00 fee for 24 hours.. Bristol is a very interesting city to visit. We enjoyed our brief stay. We would recommend this hotel. Due to developments in the area, there are a number of diversions. I found it quite tricky getting to the car park, the SAT NAV kept asking to to turn down NO ENTRY roads ! There are trees that overhang the car park. In the summer these deposit sticky sap - so be be prepared to give your car a good wash when you get home! That is a minor point, not intended to be negative regarding the quality of this hotel."
313,Rupinder,2023-06-26,"Lovely and what I needed for one night stay Staff were wonderful and I felt safe :) Decor looks a little tired, marks on wall and carpet and air con was very noisy it kept waking me up"
314,Carrie,2023-06-25,Lovely hotel! Room was comfortable and breakfast was tasty with lots of choice! Great bar and outside seating area over- looking a green park area. Comfortable bed and good shower! Shower door would not stay fully closed. Not many parking spaces so had to park in another car park.
315,Brian,2023-06-25,"Good location and staff, room not great Reception staff (esp the older chap) This room was supposed to be an upgrade by booking.com but was on par with Travelodge. No USBs in room Room too warm even with a/c lowest temp setting Not enough tea bags or milk No biscuits!"
316,Ben,2023-06-23,Was good Location and breakfast great A bit out dated and building works going on
317,Janet,2023-06-23,"Very good The hotel was a five minute walk from the station . The breakfast was very good and the staff very friendly and helpful . Twin bedded room had only one chair , one shower cap and was rather cramped . It would have been nice to have two bottles of water in the room in addition to the teas and coffees ."

319,Jillian,2023-06-20,Really enjoyed our weekend hope to come back one day. easy reach to buses and train station as we came up by train and left the car at home. The dining a bit overpriced and drinks were expensive

326,Sally,2023-06-13,"Overall lovely location and room. Would go again. Breakfast very good. Location great as near train station, pretty park and 10 mins to the riverside and shops. Staff friendly. The dinner in the evening was very expensive and limited choice on evening menu. No entertainment."
327,Jemma,2023-06-11,Superb Great value for money
328,Margaret,2023-06-11,Superb Clean tidy and staff very helpful Nothing

337,Christine,2023-05-29,Very good Clean tidy room.lovely toiletries. Air con very much appreciated. Staff great Close to central areas and Temple Meads Lack of vegan options on menus..
338,Ami2,2023-05-29,"Sure value Kind welcoming, excellent bed, large room (overclassed !), close to the train station. Sense of detail in everything. Air condition command seemed unefficient, so the room was too hot for me ; opening the window was no option considering the noisy street."
339,Jacqueline,2023-05-29,"was a short getaway, and the staff were excellent. it was near Temple Meads Station. good location. very clean ."

342,Anwen,2023-05-28,"Good location and parking on site. Friendly staff . Anne from reception came out and down the street to direct us to the hotel because road closures meant that the route was blocked, we were really grateful to her for this. parking is expensive. Make sure you pay clean air tax - not very clear notices about this and could end up in a hefty fine !"
343,Catherine,2023-05-27,Great would recommend Great choice for breakfast. room comfy big and clean. check in quick and easy. nothing all good

346,Illia,2023-05-25,"Good brand-standard hotel A nice hotel from brand, but has not much personality: - Very clean - Sound insulation is good, was quite in room, counting fact that windows were reaching big road - Location is good: very close to train station, kinda border of city center, but Bristol is small, so everything were reachable by foot - Nice park near hotel - Typical english breakfast could be more rich with fruits and vegetables - Food was the same everyday - Room is pretty small only 12 sqm - Asked slippers two times, got second pair only on second attempt"
347,Zsuzsanna,2023-05-24,Very good The bar was really nice.
348,Beatrice,2023-05-24,"Nice stay in Bristol The location was good and staff members were friendly and helpful. There were certain items missing during Monday morning breakfast (fruit yogurt - there was only plain yogurts, not the same fresh fruit selection etc.) Also the croissants were not properly baked - there was raw dough in the middle of the pastry."
349,David,2023-05-23,Great short stay to see a Gig at the Fleece Excellent stay. Nice staff and food very good. Additional cost for parking but I guess that‚Äôs standard now.
350,John,2023-05-23,"Comfortable stay but access not straightforward Room was compact but sufficient for a one night stay. Handy for the city centre and train station. Breakfast was all self-service and plentiful. Difficult to access by car as the postcode/satnav just leaves you on the main road from where the hotel is not accessible. It's necessary to arrive via the backstreets from where it is not signposted and all complicated by building works in the neighbourhood leading to road closures. Only after booking did I receive a message saying that there was limited parking at the hotel on a first come first served basis and that it would cost ¬£20, which wasn't apparent when booking. Stayed on a Sunday night, so fortunately did get a space at the hotel."
351,Trevor,2023-05-21,Superb It was lovely Staff were lovely
352,Rachael,2023-05-21,"Very good  Air con wouldn't turn off, shower door wouldn't close properly"

354,Curtis,2023-05-18,"Good location, nice room - Brilliant staff. The location was the main attraction, 5-minute walk from harbour-side. Also great breakfast and staff. The room needed some TLC in the bathroom but it was perfectly clean! Rooms are due an update but they are as clean as they can be and very comfortable. All communal areas are updated and nice to be in."
355,Rob,2023-05-17,"great hotel, will stay again staff and great breakfast options a bit overpriced"
356,Roger,2023-05-15,Superb What you would expect from a Hilton. First morning at breakfast restaurant absolutely choc-a-bloc wine 3 group tours in hotel. Was unable to get breakfast until after 9am.( Hotel already knows of this problem from their own survey request)
357,Georgia,2023-05-15,"Good Staff were extremely lovely and dealt with our requests with no complaints. Beds were super comfy, location is pretty good, and the bar in the evening time is a really great space. Our bathroom ceiling was peeling off and our plug was broken, so water didn't filter down the sink. It was manageable because we went out in the daytime and maintenance had sorted it by then but it would've been an even better stay if the plug wasn't broken."
358,Gary,2023-05-14,Very good Comfortable quiet room Very small ensuite shower room
359,Caroline,2023-05-14,"Highly recommend this hotel if you need a place to stay near the railway station The staff were lovely. There was good variety at breakfast, including make your own waffles. The room was small but had everything I needed and was very clean. There was no parking on site, as it was full, but the staff directed me to a car park literally opposite the entrance and it worked out cheaper to park there. I liked everything."
360,Michael,2023-05-12,Superb Location Great breakfast
361,Jason,2023-05-09,Comfortable & well placed near Temple Meads but make sure you don't get the room next to the gym. Staff really welcoming and helpful. Room and hotel was clean and comfortable. Woken abruptly at 7am by banging/thudding noise that went on intermittently for 20-30min. Turns out it was a guy in the hotel gym directly opposite my room slamming a dumb-bell into the ground.
362,Eleanor,2023-05-06,"Fresh, Clean, Superb Stay for a Singleton! Room was tidy, clean and quiet. Bed was comfy. Bathroom was clean and bright with nice smelling toiletries and fluffy towels. TV and remote worked and plenty of channels. Coffee bar in bedroom was nice with quiet boiling kettle. Desk and chair were great. Breakfast was lovely--easy instructions to use the waffle maker, which tables were vacant/occupied and where to get drinks. Surrounded by office buildings (quiet on weekends but gave a professional vibe). Could have been more fresh fruit available at breakfast. Elevator chimer bell could have been turned off or on silent during the night (like 23:00-7:00) as rooms near the elevator could hear the elevator bell during those times. Ran out of pastries at breakfast and they weren't replenished quickly."
363,Robert,2023-05-06,The parking should be free as the price of the stay is getting dearer Breakfast and location
364,Arthur,2023-05-04,"Superb Excellent location, very close to the train station and walking distance to restaurants, shops, etc Great staff, very friendly and helpful! Excellent breakfast"
365,Slatter,2023-05-04,"Very good Very clean hotel and smelt beautiful, staff were very helpful Breakfast wasn't cooked quite enough but a nice selection."
366,Raymond,2023-05-04,"Good hotel but noisy location and poor A/C Clean, modern and tidy. Car parking outside. Nice bar, food and a quiet outdoor verandah to enjoy a drink on rattan sofas. Service was excellent. Too near a busy main road and traffic noise from 4am even with windows shut. Rear rooms are available though. A/C was poor, the controller didn‚Äôt work as per the instructions and the fan noise was on and off all night and the room cooled a little but it was stuffy. Uncomfortable sleep. It‚Äôs not really near a good choice of restaurants or bars and a taxi is required. The extra service charge added to restaurant service."
367,Paul,2023-05-03,Very good Excellent breakfast service - location is great for centre of city
368,Amy,2023-05-02,great location and price location bed a bit hard and not enough pillows
369,Robert,2023-05-02,"Overnight in Bristol. This is a good business hotel in the developing area of the city towards Temple Meads. We chose the Hilton Garden rather than our usual Hilton Double Tree on the basis of a free breakfast and a room upgrade. The breakfast was fine. I think the room upgrade consisted of a larger bed in a normal sized room, and as a result we found the room and bathroom a bit cramped compared with the Hilton Doubletree which is an older hotel. But overall it was a good place to stay. The outlook from the restaurant, over the Temple Gardens, was particularly pleasant. Our room, at the from of the hotel, faced onto the dual carriageway Temple Way and traffic noise was noticeable at certain times."
370,Helen,2023-05-02,"Superb Room was very clean, staff were friendly, and professional, breakfast was amazing!!"
371,Lana,2023-05-02,"Good The hotel is situated very close to the central part of Bristol, it's easy to get anywhere from it. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Parking - we were told we had to pay for a 24-hour stay at the car park, there was even a sign at the reception. However, the parking does not belong to the hotel and we only found out after leaving that we could have paid far less, given that the car didn't even stay there for 12 hours."
372,Paul,2023-05-01,lovely clean hotel. 5 minute walk to station for airport bus bar
373,Haigh,2023-05-01,Very good Bedroom ok Cost too high .difficult access to the car park needs sign posting to get into car park
374,Donna,2023-04-29,Superb restaurant the bed was uncomfortable lumpy
375,Lorraine,2023-04-27,We travelled in a group of 6 and we all said we would be happy to use this hotel again. Staff were friendly and efficient. The location worked perfectly. The standard of cleanliness was very good. Building work noise ( but no fault of the hotel ) Rather a lack of places to sit that were not In restaurant. The door key cards were hit and miss at working - however staff were always quick to respond.
376,Wen,2023-04-25,"last minute booking for a weekend stay with good experience breakfast spread are good . and the staff customer service are superb. Parking is charged at 20GBP which is standard for this location/area. despite the new look, i feel the hotel interior are kind old fashion. i,e: no USB charging point near the bed."

381,Jazmin,2023-04-19,"Good for a night out. Staff were great, lobby was lovely. Good access. There were black marks all up a wall and paint peeling off the ceiling above the shower and a bunch of lights didn't work, but it served its purpose! Parking was annoying."
382,Jazmin,2023-04-19,"Lovely room, lovely view, dodgy shower. Staff were amazing. Room was bright, beautiful, clean and lovely view of the park. The shower wasn't great. Would just point towards the door even if you tried to move it and got everything wet. Bathroom floor was ice cold."
383,Josh,2023-04-17,Good  provide single beds if possible.
384,Eirwen,2023-04-16,"Great location , friendly staff , bit pricy Friendly staff , great location , comfortable rooms We thought that ¬£9 for two coffees was a bit steep"

386,Kay,2023-04-15,"Central location - well placed for a city break. Great location and friendly staff throughout hotel, plus an excellent breakfast."
387,Stephen,2023-04-12,"A great place to stay for a short visit. Room was great, slept well. Quiet and comfortable and with a good shower. Compact but good value for the location. Breakfast, included in our room rate, was excellent. Fresh and warm croissants and a good hot breakfast buffet with omelettes cooked to order, waffles and cold buffet items also available, plus decent coffee from a machine. Staff were very attentive, friendly and efficient. The property and the room was really clean which is a plus. No dislikes but mattress was a little hard otherwise everything else was comfortable."
388,Julie,2023-04-12,Great location and friendly staff. The staff were very friendly and the location perfect. Nothing really.
389,Alki,2023-04-11,Great location with good breakfast great location - close to the train and the city centre everything you need good breakfast the outside of the building seems too 'old' / industrial - but very minor. The inside is fine.
390,Jeanette,2023-04-10,highly recommended superb room and facilities not a lot of tv channels
391,Ying,2023-04-10,Will definitely stay with Hilton again üëçüèª The breakfast was exceptional! Had a fab wake up coffee and made my own waffles. The room is quiet and I slept through the night comfortably. All staffs are very attentive and friendly.
392,Rachael,2023-04-10,"comfortable hotel at a good price and good location super location, helpful staff, smart rooms, brilliant breakfast parking was almost an issue but they sorted it for us"
393,Payal,2023-04-10,Good amazing afternoon and night staff. Rooms are tired looking but comfortable beds. The breakfast staff absolutely amazing work and cooking done well. It is interesting that the charge for breakfast at the hotel is more around ¬£12.00 and booking.com reflects ¬£10.00. The ¬£10.00 should be applied regardless.
394,Martin,2023-04-10,"Superb Location, hair conditioner and other hygiene properties in the bathroom, perfect breakfast Missing toilet brush"
395,Amparo,2023-04-10,"Great hotel. The room was comfy, and all the staff, restaurants, services, etc, too. Everything was almost perfect, but there was one problem. The room door was annoying because it didn't open the door easily. We asked in the reception to change the card door, and they did but still with the same problem."
396,Lloyd,2023-04-10,"The staff were excellent and accomodating. However, our linen had holes in it, which was concerning. As a whole, the hotel is relatively clean and in an easily accessible location. There was a smell of fish when walking from the ground floor to first floor for most of our stay at the hotel."
397,Daniel,2023-04-09,couldn‚Äôt get parking space . even though we‚Äôd paid for it. we did get a refund . the meal wasn‚Äôt value for money. lovely the car parking wasn‚Äôt great
398,Katy,2023-04-09,"it was short and sweet, shared a twin room with my daughter who is 19 so space was a little tight! the bathroom was quit was clean throughout the bedroom was small and bathroom! a few bits could do with amending"
399,Lindsey,2023-04-09,"Clean modern and well situated. All good apart from the parking confusion. The location was good. It was a short walk to the river and some of the central spots. Clean and modern room. Friendly staff. Breakfast was a good selection and included in the price. Confusion about the parking. We knew spaces were limited and first-come-first-serve, however my friend arrived first and was reassured that we could park on the yellow hatch marked boxes up against the building if no spaces were available. I arrived and parked in one of those yellow boxes, however when I double checked this at check-in, the staff member I spoke to said this was not allowed due to a recent change of policy. She told me I would have to move the car and gave some poor advice about other local car parks (one of them only allowed 4-hour slots whereas I was staying for 48 hours and the other one required pre-booking and had no availability). I asked why several other cars were parked in the boxes and received a vague answer that they were guests who were checking out, however this was 5.30pm and I also noted that there were at least 2 different cars parked in the yellow boxes at any point during my stay. Ultimately I managed to grab a proper space (quite expensive at ¬£20 per night) but it all made for a frustrating and flustering start to the stay. I should mention that my friend was also told that the disabled bays were fine to use if nothing else was available but I would not have felt comfortable to do that."
400,John,2023-04-09,"thoroughly enjoyable, would stay again room was lovely, clean and spacious, breakfast was very good, location was a bit out of town location a bit out of town"
401,Christopher,2023-04-08,"Good stay Great location, well appointed room which was available early :-) Restaurant was pricey and the shower cubicle ceiling paint was peeling badly."
402,Pal,2023-04-08,"Not bad for a few days in Bristol First of all, let me give a shout-out to the extremely helpful hotel personnel who went out of their way to make our stay problem-free. Thank you. Staying on the positive side, the location of the hotel is great, it is located a few minutes from shopping centres, not too far from nice attractions. And Bristol is a very nice city. The room was small and heating was not adequate, so an electric heater was provided which had a tendency to overheat when we used it full on. During early morning I was able to sit in the bar and work, though the wall sockets did not have power."
403,Jason,2023-04-07,"Excellent Hotel, Amazing Staff The staff were very friendly and courteous and could not do enough for you, from the reception to restaurant to chamber maids, all were amazing. Before we arrived, I asked for an early check-in due to getting to Bristol very early that morning. A note was put on the system. On arrival, no rooms were available, which was very understandable, but we were told to go into the restaurant and grab a coffee or some food while we where waiting , to me, this was a really nice gesture to arriving guests.. Then we were told our room was ready, we were in our room around 11.30/12.00 ... the hotel could do no wrong, the whole hotel is kept very clean and all staff are an absolute credit to the hilton group, If we return to Bristol I know exactly where we will be staying ' The Hilton Garden Inn' Nothing.."
404,Karen,2023-04-07,"Great location, easy to check in and out Staff very friendly and efficient"

406,Tamsin,2023-04-04,Good Suited my needs for a single night stay Some very rude and unhelpful staff on the front desk
407,Scott,2023-04-03,Superb We had very friendly service and we really enjoyed the central location which is walking distance to kings street and the nightlife. Booked in advance so the rooms were good value as well. No complaints at all.
408,Tracey,2023-04-02,Perfect for a meet up as just round the corner from the train station It was the chosen and ideal location for a small group of friends to meet up. There was no warm relaxing area of comfy seating
409,Huskypup,2023-03-26,"Excellent hotel, location and facilities. Hotel is located set back from a main road, 8 minutes walk from Temple Meads station. Access can be made from front or rear. Restaurant on ground floor. Lifts to all floors. Spacious double room, with shower room. Cupboard with ironing board and iron. Large flat screen TV opposite large double bed, featuring bedside shelves, lamps, reading lights and sockets. Side table/desk with drawers inc. hairdryer, lamp and office style chair. Folding wall mirror above. Floor to ceiling window with opening pane, view only of a close neighbouring building under construction (as of March 2023). Additional comfortable leatherette chair. Double mirrored wardrobe with hangers and drawers, side cupboard containing fridge and safe. Clean kettle and basic tea & coffee above. Shower room with toilet, shelves, sink, and separate shower cubicle. Various towels and soap dispensers provided. Really not much to fault. The bed creaked and banged every time I moved. Lifts could be heard clearly despite my room being some distance from them. The main ceiling light didn't work. One of the desk drawers was broken."
410,Carolynne,2023-03-26,Superb It is close to town and the station. It has all the facilities that I need. Nothing
411,Ben,2023-03-21,"OK‚Ä¶ not bad, not amazing! I‚Äôm a bit of a foodie and whilst the cooked breakfast looked good it was only OK.. eggs were under, sausage and bacon were over.. I appreciate it‚Äôs a buffet and it‚Äôs hard to get right.. the bread I toasted was actually really good!! The bed creaked loudly from any movement.. I looked under and it was made from MDF sections that were loosely bolted together and without correct tools I couldn‚Äôt fix it! Wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker‚Ä¶ Bathroom was tiny and shower was in poor condition, broken door hinge, cracked tray and blistered paint to ceiling.. All clean and functional, would have been upset if I had paid any more!"
412,Caroline,2023-03-21,"Superb Location, staff and good value. A light and airy hotel with comfortable clean rooms."
413,Alice,2023-03-20,"Cheap and clean but rather basic Location and parking. Basic but clean. Air con/heating didn't work, no toiletries, bed uncomfortable. In need of TLC for example mirror and toilet roll holder both loose. Did the job for a cheap hotel."

Room was a little cold to start with despite heating on maximum, bur warmed up later (I presume centrally controlled). On the expensive side for what it is, but that's Bristol for you."
419,Celia,2023-03-16,Very pleasant. Everything we needed. Will probably come again. Room was great - we seemed to get a free upgrade If we were being really fussy I suppose we would like barista coffee at breakfast
420,Tina,2023-03-13,"A great return visit! Great location, excellent breakfast and breakfast staff. Good quality food in the restaurant. Beds/pillows a bit hard. subject to choice!"
421,Linda,2023-03-13,Very good Staff on desk and in the restaurant were very polite and helpful The bottles in bathroom need to be checked and filled up when room is made up and the room wasn't very warm

424,Neil,2023-03-07,Superb staff friendliness. location.
425,Deborah,2023-03-07,"Good Comfortable and clean room. Nice and friendly receptionists. We drove by car but it was extremely difficult to find the hotel due to road works in the vicinity. A message from the hotel before the day of arrival would have been helpful to advise on the route. When we arrived there was a huge noise coming from the dining room area where people were drinking, and drunk. Perhaps some carpets would help to soften the noise?"
426,Stephanie,2023-03-06,Superb The great location and friendly and helpful staff.
427,Robert,2023-03-06,"Fairly standard hotel of its type, can't complain. Comfortable beds, good bar, easy distance to walk into town We suspected the car park would be full, as it is advertised as first come, first served, so we parked out of town. Glad we did, the car park was full and there's not really anywhere local to it that we could see to find a spot."
428,Jennifer,2023-03-05,"Good if you don‚Äôt mind a very small bathroom friendly staff, handy location for what I needed bathrooms are very small. The shower door is a challenge to manage!"

433,Elizabeth,2023-02-25,Perfect for my needs Location Offered early check in on arrival without asking Staff at reception weren‚Äôt very familiar with bus options & timetable to airport. Information online but had hoped for a little local knowledge to make best decision to be on time

435,Joshua,2023-02-23,"Very good Room and facilities were exceptionally clean and tidy. Bed was very comfortable. Breakfast service was lovely and satisfying. Arrival and departure was smooth and fast. The air temperature control was out-dated, and very loud in the room."
436,Sophie,2023-02-20,"lovely weekend but wouldn‚Äôt stay again the location It was advertised in a very luxurious way, promised city views and got scaffolding and boarded up buildings. Said it was soundproof but alas it was not and we could hear people throwing up the alcohol they consumed at 2am. A queen suite which was smaller than our room at home. It was a lovely weekend but I wouldn‚Äôt book again."

Noisy room but great breakfast! - breakfast was very good and great variety! one of the best I had in the UK! - not far from city center, location is good. nice garden nearby. - staff was very friendly ! - the room A/C is too noisy and does not really heat much even at max power. - I could not sleep because of the noise from the A/C - bathroom very small - pillows were not very comfortable and felt cheap - room a bit worn out"

448,David,2023-02-12,"City stay Great location close to mainline station and short walk to city centre. Large, clean room.

449,Stacey,2023-02-12,"Professional, easy check-in, superb hotel with great breakfast! Breakfast was amazing, the waffle maker was a complete surprise and added bonus! Only downside to the room is would of love to have a bath, but the shower was wonderful anyway"
450,Patricia,2023-02-11,Superb Close to city centre but in a quiet location All good!!
451,Ian,2023-02-11,Good All as expected. Room to park when I arrived but actually getting into the car park was not easy - no signs to direct from main road as no access from main road - have to go around the back roads and through some building works to other buildings.
452,John,2023-02-10,Good Clean and tidy hotel in a good location Access with a car was very difficult with no signage. Dinner choices were quite limited
453,Fiona,2023-02-10,"Convenient and relaxed Breakfast staff very efficient, friendly and the area was always replenished. The toiletries in the room were lovely and it was great to see a new hairdryer. Public areas very clean and lift was spacious. No one came in to make our bed or renew our refreshments on either day of the stay. That would have been good."
454,Gill,2023-02-09,"Lovely stay Clean and comfortable, with amazing staff. Restaurant food was delicious, would definitely recommend. Really tight on the tea/coffee front... Constantly had to go to reception to ask for more. Reception were happy to give, but it would have been so much nicer to have more than 2 coffee sachets and 4 milk."

458,Daniel,2023-02-04,"okay clean, functional ¬£20 for parking is terrible and opportunities for making even more money, The room was worth what we paid so parking on top was laughable no extra touches and the shower had hand gel instead of shampoo"

463,Joseph,2023-01-29,"Good hotel facilities, rude staff The hotel was what you would expect from a Hilton sunchain. Clean, unspectacular. Good location. Room was a good size and showers were great. I lost my debit card in the week leading up to my stay. Advised by booking.com to update card prior to the stay. The hotel took a payment of about ¬£1 to check the card. I went to check in where we were greated by a member of staff who was somewhat nonplusssed that we were there. In fairness she had checked another couple in just prior. There were other customers at the desk. I was asked for my details. The receptionist, within earshot of my parter and other customers, mentioned that my card was declined earlier in the week, in a tone and demeanour which was not friendly. I explained that I had put a new card on file which the hotel had taken money from. The fact this was said in earshot of others was quite emabarrasing. I checked in. Nipped downstairs shortly after and took a can of soft drink from the fridge in reception. As soon as I took the can out, another member of staff approached me asking if I intended to pay for it. This happened within a split second of me removing said can from the fridge. This leads me to believe that something may have been mentioned re: the declined card, as if I had been profiled. I advised the member of staff that I had intended to pay for this. I put the can in the fridge as I felt embarrased and purchased from the bar instead, from that member of staff, to save any awkwardness in regards to the fridge. I went to reception the next morning having slept on this. A male receptionist was on at this point. I recounted yesterdays issues with him, only to be informed that they always challenge people using the fridge as people assume it is free (it clearly isnt, the price list is visible). He seemed exasperated to even consider dealing with my complaint. There was no apology or anything. I felt as though I was being looked down"
464,Scott,2023-01-27,Superb Friendly and helpful reception staff Nothing
465,Beverley,2023-01-23,"Excellent location near station, friendly staff central location rooms a little cold"

467,Sally,2023-01-20,handy location for bar on the river good location advertised as parking on site but only after booking does it say first come basis. got the last space when I arrived at 4pm for check in
468,Graham,2023-01-07,"very good location and good staff, shame about the room and size. The property is in a very good location, with easy access to the city centre and train station. Views over the gardens are good and the location is perfect for a ‚Äúcar free‚Äù visit to Bristol. The entrance and fragrance in the reception area is exceptional and the staff were very friendly. The rooms are simply not big enough for the price being demanded, in addition the mattress was very uncomfortable to sleep on and the bed creaked and cracked with every movement on it (a person who weighs less than 80kg) this made for a very disruptive nights sleep. The in room facilities although adequate do not reflect what I would‚Äôve expected from a Hilton brand hotel. The wash/bathroom is tiny with very little room to move in and the shower again was very small."
469,Danielle,2023-01-06,great value and clean rooms highly recommended staff or manager was so helpful with advise where to visit on our tour of Bristol clean rooms and breakfast was very yummy would highly recommend na
470,Davinia,2023-01-06,"Good The reception staff were lovely and helpful One of the cleaner ladies was really rude and tried to get into my room even though the door had the ""do not disturb"" sign on. She was aggressively trying to break in, and when I did leave my room- she was then rude to me. One time, she didn't even bother to clean it."
471,Mike,2023-01-05,Good Convenience
472,Menglong,2023-01-05,"Good The location was prefect for me as I had come here by train. So it only took me a few minutes to get off the train and reach the hotel. Besides, there is a bus station in front of hotel, which means you can easily get to the city center. Almost everything in the hotel was very good. There was only one thing I didn't like and that was the small size of the room and the small bathroom."
473,Lisa,2022-12-27,"Great stay Friendly staff, nice comfortable rooms"
474,Rob,2022-12-23,Great Reception Staff Good Location Cost
475,Stuart,2022-12-22,Good Nice foyer with friendly and accommodating staff My room was cold but was given a portable heater.
476,Thomas,2022-12-19,"OK but expensive parking (even when empty) and mis-priced breakfast Comfort & location High price parking. High price breakfast, which was increased by ¬£2 over advertised rate, and increased by a further ¬£2 if not pre-booked"
477,Alanah,2022-12-19,"great staff, ambience and value for money really lovely staff and check in experience, friendly bar staff and really nice ambience downstairs, room was basic but nice and clean."
478,Chris,2022-12-18,it served its purpose being close to centre and relatives convenient location ltd parking
479,Patricia,2022-12-17,Superb Staff are always helpful and willing to go the extra mile. The location is convenient - close to the town centre but in a quiet spot.
480,Simon,2022-12-17,"Just a better class of 'basic'. PLUS parking expense! Great location for our stay in Bristol and a very comfortable (and warm thankfully) room. Not much in the way of hotel facilities. The restaurant/bar wasn't somewhere you wanted to spend time. And you pay ¬£16 a night for parking, which isn't made clear in the booking steps. This felt like 'hidden' costs to me. Plus parking, plus breakfast! For a Hilton, it had no luxurious feel to it at all. Just a better class of 'basic'. I wouldn't stay again."
481,Sarah,2022-12-16,good hotel for a night‚Äôs stay. the location was perfect. The staff were lovely and the room was comfortable and very clean. the snack we had in the bar was delicious if a little pricey. my room was freezing even after turning up the heat and the aircon fan sounded like a freight train. even after I switched it off it occasionally started up again. a bottle of water and some tissues in the room would have been appreciated.
482,Kathryn,2022-12-12,"would come again location, friendly staff, good breakfast problem with heating, resolved with a heater and extra duvet"
483,Claire,2022-12-11,"Good modern hotel near Temple Meads station The staff were great, so helpful, and helped us to find somewhere to go out for dinner. Room was very modern and comfortable, good bathroom. We had a nice view of the park, and it's super convenient for Temple Meads train station The price was room only and quite high because of that. It's quite a modern hotel, but would be improved by adding some USB charging points, which most modern hotels seem to have these days"
484,Martyn,2022-12-07,"A pleasant stay Staff welcoming, beds comfortable and room not too warm The soap dispenser in the bathroom was empty. There was no water at all on one of the mornings so could not shower/wash before breakfast."
485,Cheryl,2022-12-05,Very good The hotel is nice room was very cramped and too small for two people. Offered up grade by email but was refused on the reception desk on arrival infront of other customers very embarrassed bathroom was tiny had to ho in and shut the door to be able to get to the toilet.. no biscuits in the room and only a couple of milks. Clean and breakfast was good
486,M5l,2022-12-04,Superb Breakfast!
487,Christine,2022-12-03,Very good Clean. Comfortable. Close to train station. Far out from main area.. where most restaurants and pubs are.
488,Sarah-jane,2022-12-01,stayed in many hotels in Bristol it was okay Nice and clean we arrived to be told there was no bar Friday or Saturday evening due to private parties. limited parking too which we weren‚Äôt expecting
489,John,2022-11-28,"A comfortable stay in an ideal location. The staff were very helpful, the room was comfortable and the breakfast buffet was very nice. Some of the facilities were a little tired and need of update/replacement. For example, the window catch was broken and the mirror was not properly in its fixture."
490,Jane,2022-11-27,overnight stay to meet family. good location easy walk into centre good location paying for parking
491,Caron,2022-11-27,Very good The man on Reception was very helpful even got me and extra duvet as I was cold Our neighbours had no respect
492,Kerri,2022-11-20,"Superb Everything. Lovely welcome, given extra blankets as get cold and amazing breakfast. Only one thing. Mattress was not that comfortable and very creaky when turning over."
493,Emily,2022-11-19,Very good  the beds were very creaky and the walls very thin - could hear everything next door
494,Bill,2022-11-19,"A one stay and the hotel delivered in all respects. Staff are superb, helpful and freindly Staff were very helpful during and after my stay. I left an item in the room which they found and communicated to me, then returned. Nothing."
495,Lalitkumar,2022-11-18,Ideal Stay hotel located in walking distance from Temple Meads Rail Station. Rooms are well appointed. Twin bedded rooms are bigger then Queen bed rooms. Breakfast is nice and good spread. More Veg dishes would be appreciated in breakfast. Bus no 8 stop is right in front of the hotel to go to Clifton Suspension Bridge and near Cabot Circus Departmental Store. Trains to Cardiff and Bath Spa Town are easily available from Temple Meads Rail Station. Thanks to the Reception staff for sending Birthday Cake for my wife to our Room.
496,Elisabeth,2022-11-16,"Nice, clean hotel. A bit expensive for what you are getting. Room was clean Bed really hard and uncomfortable Not a lot of parking available"
497,Sophie,2022-11-16,"Superb  I had specifically asked for some gin to be delivered on the 2nd night of our stay (as my friend's special anniversary) but sadly they had put it out on the first night so when we arrived it was already sitting there, very nice, but on the wrong day. I told a member of staff at Reception and he said what would he like me to do and I half-heartedly said 'Another would be nice on the actual day of celebration tomorrow night!' He said fine - which was a mistake as it did not appear the next evening. He should not have agreed without asking his supervisor probably. A beautiful hotel so this was a real shame that this happened."
498,Tanya,2022-11-15,Will stay there again. Parking available on site. Large clean room. Nice breakfast. Having to pay for parking on site.
499,Jackie,2022-11-11,"Typical city centre hotel. Close to station. Staff were very good, friendly and helpful throughout, especially as just arrived from Heathrow Garden Hilton, so better in comparison. Breakfast was OK (although surprisingly, not as good as the Heathrow GH). Didn't have dinner but a satisfactory (if expensive) sandwich and the bar was reasonably pleasant. Rooms are a bit small and I didn't find the bed that comfortable (others may have a different experience). The place is looking a bit tired, but not unacceptably so."
500,Ajsidebottom,2022-11-11,Adequate room for overnight stay with comfortable bed. Avaialbility of bar. Breakfast on site. Comfortable room. Close to Temple Meads railway station - 5 minute walk Close to city centre - 10 minute walk Moderately close to university - 20 minute walk Shower room small Breakfast food a little overcooked Requested quiet room but adjacent to main ring road so traffic noise - muffled.
501,Neya,2022-11-10,"Enjoyable return visit to this clean, comfortable, hotel supported by friendly and helpful staff. We have stayed there before. Comfortable good-size room. Good restaurant. Pleasant, helpful staff. Mini fridge in room really useful. Wi-Fi was fairly reliable. Bed was comfortable. Would have liked a bath as well as a shower. A couple of maintenance issues in room. Had to ask twice for more toilet rolls. No shampoo in dispenser. Pillows were a bit soft. Cleaner took the wine glasses we brought, but bar staff happily replaced these. Car park expensive at ¬£16 per day."
502,Kerry,2022-11-03,Very good Staff were great Room was a little small.
503,Christopher,2022-10-31,"Nice, welcoming and generally clean hotel. Rooms are a little outdated. Lobby was clean, glamorous, and smelled lovely, nice and open and very inviting. The room seemed a little outdated with the decor, that had chips, scratches all over it and also loose hair left in the drawers. I felt like the attention to detail when it came to cleaning was somewhat rushed."
504,Nichola,2022-10-30,"Ideal place for music venues and temple meades Central location- for Temple Meades Easy to find Walkable Quiet (from outside noise)- even on the main road side! Bathroom good size Toiletries available Iron and ironing board available Tv actually worked (no TV guide though) Bed size was good (two twins together) Needs sockets on both sides of bed Noise- bathrooms, from neighbouring rooms Pillows too soft- feather (personal preference) Size comparable to price, didn‚Äôt feel like a good deal"
505,Veronica,2022-10-29,the proof that great employees will make your stay better the lobby area and the breakfast. But the only thing that made it worth it was the personnel. The girls at the reception were amazing. Super friendly and helpful. The made the difference The bathroon was not clean.
506,Stuart,2022-10-29,Very good close to transport links
507,Katie,2022-10-29,"Very convenient and parking was a bonus. Lovely staff and great location Really convenient location and parking too for ¬£16 for 24 hours, which was great for us. The housekeeping staff were super helpful as I asked for extra cups and towels and nothing was too much trouble for them. The breakfast was very good too. A minor and very minor would be to have more fruit options rather than just melon and pineapple, but everything else was excellent."
508,Georgia,2022-10-28,Friendly staff and comfortable hotel Clean and comfortable and in a central location - staff were really friendly!

514,Coralie,2022-10-18,"Welcoming and comfortable A welcoming and very comfortable hotel - rooms are spotless, comfortable and with great views toward the park (rear). Easiky accessible from Temple Meads. Staff are friendly and responsive. Nothing"
515,Wendy,2022-10-17,"Sort out the car parking - just saying it is very limited is not at all helpful! Very helpful staff, hotel was clean, well maintained and comfortable. Ridiculous system with the car parking - not nearly enough car parking spaces - said first come first served but this caused me considerable distress not knowing whether I could access a car parking space and no idea where else I could park because there was no offer of other information or signage. There was more room in the tiny car park to create more spaces but the owner has not bothered to think about the basic needs of its customers. Put me off staying there. I gave it a good as the female receptionist on duty very kindly allowed me to park in an unused disabled car park which I really appreciated her for her initiative for a system that was not her fault."
516,Robert,2022-10-16,Very good location and cleanliness good choice for breakfast but hot food was cold
517,Sharon,2022-10-16,Smart hotel and good location Smart hotel. Handy location for the train. Breakfast was a little disappointing as there was no brown bread for toast and the poached egg didn't taste nice.
518,Lee,2022-10-16,"Great location , cheap when booking early. would stay again close to city center , parking available at the hotel at rate of ¬£16 a night. staff allowed us to check in early and have rooms next to each other rooms are very simple for a Hilton. lots of little snagging that could have been done. loose toilet handle , black Sicilians seals etc"
519,Sherrie,2022-10-15,"Perfect for our needs but were starving when we went to bed Very clean, friendly staff, good location for where we needed to be Beds too hard, even though the heating / air conditioning was off, it was very noisy and sounded like we were in a wind tunnel throughout the night. No where it get food when we came back at 11.30pm, bar and resteraunt closed and no takeaways near hotel"
520,Abbie,2022-10-15,Shaky start but comfortable stay. Staff very helpful when there was a problem checking in. Room very clean and comfy. The problem checking in!

532,Bianca,2022-10-02,"Good Stayed here a couple of times, no real issues. Great location, on site parking, helping staff and room service with tasty food. Whenever I tried to ring reception or room service no one would answer so I ended up having to go down to order, then my order arrived with missing bits. Also I had to sit in the bar for 45 mins as there was a delay with my check in, they told me I was given a free upgrade to apologise but when I got to my room it was tiny and smaller than the one I had originally booked."
533,Karen,2022-10-02,"Staff were lovely Close to amenities The beds!!! Awful, really hard and terribly squeaky"

535,Steve,2022-09-30,"Great location and comfort in central Bristol. Location great for walking to everything within the city centre including shopping centres, bars, and restaurants. Hotel easy to get to from railway station. All staff excellent - welcoming and keen to help. Every part of hotel very clean. Comfortable furnishings. There are plenty of hotels in central Bristol but I would be happy to stay in this one again. Room good if a little dark. Breakfast OK but somehow lacking a little on flavour - eggs cold. Coffee OK."
536,James,2022-09-30,"Very good Room, staff, service all very good. Access to the hotel car park was very difficult due to ongoing work. Very poor sign posting. It took me 40 minutes and several attempts to get into the car park."

547,Hayley,2022-09-11,"Very good Friendly staff, lovely breakfast. Clean bathroom and bed/bedding. We had 3 rooms booked and reception staff made sure we were in rooms next to each-other without us requesting this. Close to the city centre. Skirting boards and behind beds very dusty, could do with pulling beds out to clean behind."
548,Zoe,2022-09-11,Lovely & comfortable would definitely stay again I stayed for one night the rooms where lovely & clean bigger enough for two people it had tea/coffee facilities plus hairdryer all the stuff was lovely evening food was a bit pricey but as for breakfast ¬£14 for whatever you could eat and drink which I think is really good How noisy the doors are when they‚Äôre closing they close with quite a Big Bang

554,Graham,2022-09-06,"Nice and comfortable, with some outstanding service We were looking for the hotel by car at about 6 pm on Saturday night. We could not find it. We rang the hotel, and the receptionist on duty was brilliant at guiding us in by phone and then helping us in the car park. Arrangements for breakfast could have been managed a bit better. For example, I asked for honey. The member of staff returned with two large boxes of the stuff, suggesting it was meant to be on offer but was not. No-one checked me in on either breakfast that I attended. I could have walked in off the street."
555,Stephen,2022-09-05,business trip nice hotel in good location breakfast was not very good and cold and very expensive

My bed was very comfy also. My door was very dodgy. I couldn‚Äôt close it properly unless I properly slammed it shut. One night I was worried I couldn‚Äôt get into my room because it just wasn‚Äôt opening. The bolt just wouldn‚Äôt loosen for the door to open. Luckily it did in the end, but I think the bolt needs fixing."
559,M√≥nica,2022-08-30,"Very good The location it's great close to Bristol Temple Meads and just short distance to city centre. Good size room. The air con was a bit noise even when not working and was difficult to control and because I was on 5th floor I could hear a constant machine noise that I was not sure was coming from. I would suggest putting a bottle of water in the rooms as well apart from coffee, tea and sugar bags."

582,Christopher,2022-08-04,"Forget about the breakfast. I would stay here again The hotel is very well located to the city. Being on the main road the room was very quite and had a wonderful sleep, Infact, it was so quite I often over slept. The staff on the front desk we good to chat with but the staff within the breakfast area, well, let not say anything yet Let's take Breakfast. I didn't book breakfast for not sure what hours I'd be working but the rate that Booking.com told me I'd pay on the day was different from what they were going to charge me. Between the hotel and booking.com they got it sorted. Always print things off. The staff in the breakfast area never made contact. Not even a good morning. They were very quick at clearing the tables even if you had food on your plate and gone to get another coffee. When I returned my table and food had been cleared. They were just not interested in the job."

594,Nahid,2022-07-23,lovely central location excellent location for travel connections. clean rooms. lovely toiletries. staff super helpful a bit pricey
595,Khalifa,2022-07-22,"Excellent staff and good location. The reception staff were excellent, especially the Night Shift staff who were very helpful and friendly. nothing"
596,Brian,2022-07-21,The reception staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. clean and quiet. location isn't great.
597,Sally,2022-07-20,"Comfortable, convenient stay. Would definitely stay again It was great to have a twin room option. The beds were really comfortable. Air conditioning was great. Breakfast was lovely with good choices. Staff were responsive to our queries. Ideally located for the main Bristol train station. Lots of storage Bar shut at 11pm. We would have liked a drink when we got back but it shut at 11pm and we didn't see a lot nearby apart from a Wetherspoons. The room was very small but it was fine for us for just one night."
598,Elizabeth,2022-07-20,Superb Location was good although a lot of building going on in the area so glad we didn't have a car. Room was lovely.
599,Maria,2022-07-20,Good The room was very bright and nicely structured They need to do some work to become more customer centric.
600,David,2022-07-19,All we could hope for VERY welll set out shower room but comfortable chairs a bit awkward to use without blocking someting in the space available.. Outlook over adjacent garden and resding in it a HUGE bonus. The meal we enjoyed was conventional but could not be faulted and first rate staff throughout Not much given the site but did not see a 'lounge' area we would have appreciated at other times of year. But did not ssk and may well have one.
601,Nick,2022-07-19,Very good Good location. Good breakfast. Good air con. Friendly staff.
602,Joanna,2022-07-19,all the staff were very courteous and obliging. very clean and lovely staff. it was great
603,Elizabeth,2022-07-18,"Super night away Bar, reception and breakfast staff were outstanding"
604,John,2022-07-18,"Very relaxing stay within easy walk of town centre. We were on the 5th floor. Even though the room was an the ""road"" side (i.e. not garden view), it was very quiet. This was the weekend of the boat festival - it was actually quite nice NOT to be in the centre of the action - but close enough to walk without problems. The aircon worked well and kept the room cool even when very hot outside. Very comfy pillows. Didn't try the restaurant. Staff helpful - in the absence of a concierge service, the desk staff were able to advise on a good bakery, and an easy way to get to Cathedral Walk. I still think the price was a tad high; we chose it because everywhere else anywhere near the centre was equally expensive - could have gone out of town, but then would have incurred taxi fares."
605,Rachel,2022-07-18,"Great location with good views and easy walking access to train and bus stations Outstanding location - easy walk from Bristol Temple Meads (easier from the rear exit of the station). Garden facing rooms overlook the Temple avenue of trees, which are very tall and beautiful. Hart's bakery, at the train station, is an easy walk for excellent coffee and pastries. We had breakfast in the churchyard opposite the hotel, on a bench beneat the trees. It was wonderful. Big windows but only one of them opened (and barely at that), and air conditioning that is not as powerful as it needs to be when windows don't open. No hotel stationery (paper or pens). Good selection of teas and coffees, including decaffineated options."
606,Hilary,2022-07-17,"functional‚Ä¶. staff were very good, helpful, friendly and efficient central room could have been cleaner, water marks on doors and walls from old water leaks?"
607,Nia,2022-07-17,"Great place to stay, close to the hippodrome. Very clean and had excellent facilities in the room. Staff were very helpful. The mattress was very hard and parking was ok but limited spaces and expensive."
608,Michael,2022-07-15,"Good staff were friendly at reception and the air con in the room was spot on during this heatwave curtains and walls were dirty and marked but nothing too major , double bed was 2 singles pushed together"
609,Jane,2022-07-15,"Pleasant stay, comfortable room, hotel staff were really nice I‚Äôd asked for a quiet room and was allocated one that was super quiet. The staff were very pleasant and attentive. The room air temperature was just right. The breakfast was good. The beds were comfortable. The only slight drawback about its otherwise good location is that there aren‚Äôt any cafes or restaurants really nearby."
610,Andrew,2022-07-14,"Great - would happily stay there again. Friendly and professional staff. Efficient service. Quick checkout. Room small but well appointed with plenty of storage and a in ironing board and a clean iron (ie not covered in burnt-on residue); an iron and board is so often missing in modern hotels. Great location close to amenities and train station. Cost a little more than I would have wished, but was competitive in the area. My stay was so short that I can't really think of anything that I didn't like other than the bar being shut when I arrived - although a self-service option was available in the foyer."
611,Robert,2022-07-11,Good work stay good location good food & drink clean and modern accessibility to parking
612,Brimmy,2022-07-11,Very good Clean and standard rooms. Good customer service in a fantastic location close to Temple meads Station and Bristol city centre. A good all rounder Nothing
613,Victoria,2022-07-10,"Despite the negatives, I enjoyed my short stay and would recommend. Location was good, within walking distance to the train station and local attractions. Room was perfect size. Staff were welcoming and friendly at all times. I went out into the local area for the morning and came back to a freshly made bed and everything had been restocked in the room. I felt like I was on Four in a Bed doing the room inspections, haha! The room I stayed in had dust lying around (on bed headboard, bedroom sides, areas in the shower room). The shower room was a bit small but that could just be my personal preference. The shower head was dripping despite being turned off. One of the clean hand towels had dirt on. The main light didn't work and neither did one of the plug sockets."
614,Shelly,2022-07-10,nice stay nice hotel with a modern feel very confusing to get to- the postcode takes you to the front of the building on a duel carriage way and a confusing one way system that you can‚Äôt turn down hence you can‚Äôt access the Hotel with the postcode
615,Stephen,2022-07-08,"The noisy extractor fan making sleeping difficult would make me reluctant to return Excellent breakfast. The staff were very good. Noisy extractor fan, not the air-conditioning, which was impossible to turn off which was annoying at night."
616,David,2022-07-08,Very good Good breakfast
617,Philip,2022-07-07,"Great hotel in good location A quality hotel which met our expectations. Staff were friendly and efficient, location was just what we wanted and facilities were good. Very happy with it. Car parking at ¬£16 was a quite expensive. Otherwise, it was all good."
618,Rouse,2022-07-07,"pleasant stay, pleasant and helpful staff. central location, clean, comfortable, helpful staff. well equipped and pleasant room, good breakfast. slightly busy location but not noisy on the park side of the hotel."
619,Judy,2022-07-06,Superb Reception staff are exceptionally good - nothing is too much trouble. Nothing
620,Emily,2022-07-05,"Very good staff were amazing, so lovely and helpful"
621,Dearbhla,2022-07-05,Very good location
622,John,2022-07-05,"Now that I know how to access the car park, this is a great place to stay. Very comfortable hotel situated in exactly the right place for our requirements. Finding and getting into the car park was a nightmare. Our satnav took us almost to the hotel but then I had to ask directions. I followed those and as I drove I could see the front of the hotel but with no apparent access for a car. I eventually parked and went into a Novotel hotel to ask for directions. Although the staff were helpful they were unable to give me exact directions. So, I walked around the block to the Hilton Garden Inn where the receptionist explained that I had to drive through an archway, which was clearly marked 'Novotel Hotel', and follow the road to the rear of the Garden Inn Hotel. Quite ridiculous! I could find no mention of this when I re-read everything on my confirmation email. Surely something as fundamental as this should be stated prominently on both booking.com and the hotel website? Also, the hotel charges ¬£16 per day for parking. I don't remember reading that on the website. For any potential guests who might read this review, you should be aware that there are a few spaces in the lane behind the hotel (200 yards from the rear entrance to the hotel) where parking costs are about ¬£5 a day. Not exactly secure but if, like me you object to rip-off parking then this might be an option."
623,Simon,2022-07-01,"Nice stay, nice location. Location close to the Temple Mead railway station. Breakfast choice was very good and the staff were very professional A view of concrete block of an old multi-storey car park from my hotel room window."
624,Elizabeth,2022-06-30,"The staff is very gracious and helpful and the breakfast was a good deal and plentiful. The hotel is very conveniently located to the train station, the harbor area and the Cabot Circus shopping area; all within walking distance and a bus stop for the number 8 bus is right outside and goes around the main harbor area and up to Clifton Park and the zoo. This hotel is more convenient to the train station than most but it‚Äôs a nice walk along the canal to the harbor and the M Shed area. The room was a bit of a disappointment because it needs a refurb as of May 2022 and the bed was torture but the bathroom looks like it has been redone recently enough to be clean and well equipped and the nicest part is all the shelf space in the bathroom which is rare these days."
625,Alan,2022-06-29,"Great room, great location and great views Great room, great location nothing"
626,Nicholas,2022-06-27,"convenient for city centre but beware of a tired interior and rowdy stag/hen parties also convenient for city centre the property requires updating as the interior is very tired and looked shabby also the majority of the guests seemed to be on stag and hen parties bringing a different feel to the hotel, also I resented paying for parking"
627,Laura,2022-06-27,"Alex is an asset to the Hilton, amazing customer service The location was brilliant, comfy beds, nice breakfast and overall a really lovely hotel At first we were given a room that wasn‚Äôt cleaned, this was soon rectified so no harm done"
628,Becky,2022-06-27,"Good location, comfy bed, friendly staff The room was lovely with comfy bed. I liked having a fridge in the room We went to the restaurant for dinner but found the menu very limited so we actually left and found somewhere else to eat. The shower was also difficult to set as no idea what dial did what"
629,Nikita,2022-06-27,Very good The location was great The rooms were pretty small for the money and the breakfast wasn't great . Nothing was ready and was a 20 min wait for anything to be available
630,Marc,2022-06-26,Very good Clean Parking and trying to get to car park
631,Darrell,2022-06-26,"Comfortable, lovely staff Breakfast was excellent, lots of choice, well presented and beautifully cooked. Cost of parking was a little high at ¬£16 per night."
632,Andy,2022-06-25,overnight stay to visit harbour side Clean nothing
633,Amber,2022-06-25,perfect stay for one night in Bristol it was very central and lovely breakfast the shower was quite difficult to get into
634,Ryan,2022-06-25,fair price good room good food clean and good food bar shut too early
635,Samantha,2022-06-24,"Clean, modern, comfortable and very friendly staff. The breakfast spread was fantastic. Less noisy aircon in the bedroom"
636,Simon,2022-06-24,"Fairly enjoyable Nice central location. Clean, modern hotel. The car park was too small for the size of the hotel. I had to park in another car park a 10 minute walk from the hotel and very expensive."
637,Ze\'ev,2022-06-23,It was an enjoyable stay. The breakfast was very good as was the location. All good.
638,Lauren,2022-06-22,"As expected with lovely staff Staff were great, breakfast was good, design and rooms were great. Loud air conditioning unit, bed quiet hard."
639,Stuart,2022-06-22,Lovely Bed was really comfortable Nothing
640,Luci,2022-06-21,"Really lovely staff and food; convenient location. Would stay again. The staff were lovely and helpful; food in the restaurant was great. Aircon very efficient! We had 2 single beds - I thought they could have done with mattress toppers or similar, as the mattresses were a little hard."
641,Tracey,2022-06-18,Very good Nice rooms Good selection of items at breakfast
642,Shelly,2022-06-16,"Nice location, great breakfast, hard bed. Staff greeted us warmly. They were helpful when we couldn't flag down our bus. Breakfast was very good. The room was nice and clean. We were close enough to the train station to travel about. The beds were very hard. Firm is good, but these needed some give. It was like sleeping on a board. Comfortable beds should be a high priority."
643,Robert,2022-06-15,nice stay in central Bristol hotel good central location modern hotel clean and well kept getting to the car park- various one way roads & restricted access breakfast was ok with limited options
644,Robert,2022-06-14,"Suited all our requirements plus very helpful staff regarding our concerns as we are both deaf . Good choice of Hot water for tea, not clear instructions"
645,Patricia,2022-06-14,It was very good I booked a twin room but had to wait as one wasn't ready so in the end they gave me an upgraded twin room without any extra charge which I was happy with. The location of the hotel was difficult to find as there are many contruction works surrounding it which made it less visible. The breakfast was very good. Nothing.
646,Adam,2022-06-13,"Good Large, very clean room. Very convenient for thr train station, and not that far from the city centre An uncomfortable bed, very hard base and very unsupportive pillows"
647,Gary,2022-06-10,Very good Location to town centre Breakfast layout Check in and out Room was at front of hotel by very busy road. Did not affect my stay generally but someone who requires a quieter location may prefer the rear of hotel
648,Eleanor,2022-06-08,"We had a nice stay in a comfortable hotel with very pleasant staff. Staff were all excellent - really efficient, friendly and welcoming. Room was very clean. Breakfast was excellent. Evening meal and drinks were overpriced. We had to have the windows closed due to the noise of passing traffic."
649,Jenny,2022-06-07,"Good value, pleasant stay. Pleasant, efficient staff; clean room; good location; excellent breakfast. The coldbox thing that masqueraded as a fridge in te room. Very strange."
650,Rhiannon,2022-06-07,"Great location, clean room. clean, good location, good sized room. I felt that the hotel was a little overpriced. We also had to wait longer than 3pm to check in which wasn't ideal."
651,Susan,2022-06-07,Very enjoyable mini bresk Breakfast was great Staff were really friendly and accommodating We had a great time
652,Beatrice,2022-06-07,Good Location very good View from the window. Pillows not to good. English breakfast could be hotter
653,Nathan,2022-06-06,"ideal location good location to bars and restaurants, nice seating area outside bed was uncomfortable for myself (to hard) although partner prefers it that way, sat nav takes you to front of the property where there is no left turn, bit of a nightmare finding the entrance and not very big car park, also charge for the stay"
654,Angelina,2022-06-06,"Perfect hotel for our short stay, good location and comfortable rooms! Really lovely staff, lovely and spacious rooms and comfy bed! Building work outside our window at the time, which cant be helped. Overall good stay!"

658,Vicky,2022-06-03,good overnight location for onward travel location was good finding how to get into the property
659,Katie,2022-06-03,"it was good for the price and good location, just need better pillows lots of storage space in room, good distance from train station and town centre and good mirrors and seating in the room. the pillows were too much, your head would sink into the pillow and cause alot of neck pain."
660,Joanne,2022-06-01,"convenient for city center great location , only a few minutes from the city center. break fast was excellent value ! nothing"
661,Pauline,2022-05-31,Great location. Great location near to train station. Breakfast disappointing. Bacon not cooked well. Breakfast disappointing
662,Skippy33,2022-05-30,Great stay The room and view was lovely and the lady on reception was very welcoming. There was a little bit of lipstick on one of the glasses in the room.
663,Caroline,2022-05-30,"enjoyable room, location, it was a little noisy at night time."
664,Timolene,2022-05-30,suggest restaurant serves lighter breakfasts on request like a roll with ham and cheese snd coffee for say ¬£6 as an al staff very helpful with advice and directions. excellent room interior. great design of cupboards etc. bed very comfortable. tv worked well. Tea coffee making good. mirror above dressing table was too high. thought price very very high for type of hotel. i would have expected ¬£80 per night. nonetheless I really enjoyed my stay.
665,Ole,2022-05-29,"Wonderfull hotel, we hope to come back soon! A small and clean room with a queen szized bed with a quite comfortable mattress. It was very quiet due to the fact that we had a room next to the street. The bathroom had some good amanities and was also very clean. The breakfast was a typical english breakfast, the staff was very nice. We didn¬¥t booked a breakfast option in advance but that was not a problem. The hotel is located near the center of the town, just a 10 minute walk away. The next station Temple meads is also nearby. In conclusion a nice located hotel, we enjoyed our stax. We hope to come back soon! Overall we had a wonderfull experience at the Hilton Garden Inn so it is quite difficult to find something that was wrong or could be done better. The only thing we recognized was the lacking of fresh salad, but thats what not to expect for a typical english breakfast ;-)"
666,Elena,2022-05-29,Very good Breakfast was superb. washing machine and dryer are by 24/7 available and working super fine. staff was always very helpful and in general very nice and caring.
667,Mjc1875,2022-05-28,"Good The location, staff and breakfast Small, creaking bed, noisy air conditioning"
668,Adam,2022-05-26,"Overall - the room was exactly what I needed and the staff were very friendly. No issues at all. Woman who checked me in was very nice, very accommodating, and found me an available room to check into at 11am, despite check in technically being at 3pm. That was great. She also helped with getting the 2nd room key to my friend who was arriving later. She gave me all the necessary details around breakfast etc, Difficult to say the price was great. I originally booked for just myself which was ¬£140 for just me for one night. I then swapped to 2 single beds so my friend could join & the price stayed the same, and I saved money by splitting the cost. Ideally single people shouldn't be penalised for not having a partner, and booking for just 1 person should be cheaper than booking for 2."
669,Ac,2022-05-22,"Very good Good for the price, quiet area, park view ,Not extremely clean, it was definitely not vacuumed before our stay. The mattress was not the best."
670,Brady,2022-05-21,Loved Bristol but the price of ¬£364 for two people for two nights + breakfasts was in my opponion Excellent good variety pleasant and helpful staff The room was addicate but the bathroom was too small we would have liked two chairs and more room to move carefully
671,Mark,2022-05-20,"Convenient location and great staff Good location, fairly central and very convenient. Good Hilton Garden standard with the staff being particularly welcoming and helpful. Parking quite expensive, limited bar, lobby areas. Bathroom a little small and not perfectly clean"
672,Tommy,2022-05-20,Good overall Good location Small bathroom
673,Margaret,2022-05-19,Good location for us and the staff were very helpful. Excellent breakfast with lots of choices. Only negative for me was good location and parking on site was available the bed was very firm
674,Chris,2022-05-18,Ok Great choice at breakfast. Beds were too firm and room was average for ¬£100 p/n
675,James,2022-05-17,"Excellent stay Lovely, spacious room. Very clean and welcoming. Excellent location, very near Bristol Temple Meads and city centre. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room came with all amenities expected."

677,Kimberley,2022-05-16,lovely weekend in Bristol not far from the train station
678,Peter,2022-05-15,"Will definitely go again, but only if a proper disabled room with twin beds is available Very clear (and necessary) directions given to the hotel and the adjoining car park. Superb location for easy walking access to the city centre and docks. Excellent wheelchair access for my wife's wheelchair. The staff at reception and in the restaurant were so helpful, above and beyond expectations. Good atmosphere with the staff. Given thorough instructions for disabled exit in the event of an emergency. Lobby, waiting area, restaurant all on one ground floor level. Beds were very good, we both slept really well, much better than at home. Plenty of eating places to suit all tastes within 10 mins walk of the hotel. We needed twin beds due to my wife's disability. The only disabled rooms with twin beds were not full spec for disabled, so the room was too narrow, and no seat in the shower and insufficient handholds. The full spec disabled rooms only had double beds. I spoke to the manager, who was so helpful, efficient and friendly in all matters, who said he would recommend to your GM to adapt one of these rooms for twin beds. No biscuits in the room! Food in the restaurant was good but not excellent. The scrambled eggs were outstanding one morning and quite awful on the next day. Coffee machine troublesome.."
679,Alice,2022-05-13,Perfect location and comfy The bed was really comfortable. It is a great location for both the city centre and the train station. The shower was nice but rather small. The curtains were not black out and I'm a rather light sleeper. The duvet was too heavy for the time of year.
680,Db,2022-05-12,"Excellent stay, will stay again. great location, very good facilities. The staff are very helpful. Clean and great comfort. The bathroom was a bit small, could have been a bit bigger. Otherwise all are ok."
681,Andre,2022-05-12,"Great location friendly staff good breakfast. Great location for local bars and restaurants and only a short walk along the river to the marina area. Good friendly staff, unusual for a hotel chain these days ! Great to have car parking in the centre of the City although it was quite expensive (¬£16). ¬£16 parking."
682,Susan,2022-05-11,Very good Room and breakfast
683,Sarah,2022-05-10,Very good Room was very comfortable. Good facilities. Good location Cleaning staff very noisy in surrounding rooms. Chatting on phone directly outside.

687,John,2022-05-04,"Bristol getaway. Excellent breakfast. The room was basic,but clean."
688,Clive,2022-05-04,"Good value and quality business or city centre accommodation. My room was at the back of the hotel making it a quiet without any disturbances in the night. Access to hotel car park challenging due to the road works, with all but one access street closed."
689,Stewart,2022-05-03,"Surprisingly quiet hotel near the centre My room at the back of the hotel was very quiet with a nice open, green, view - unexpected for the centre of town. Staff were very friendly and the room was faultless if generic. It was a good experience marred only by the absence of camomille tea in the room-set. It would be nice to see at least one non-stimulant tea."
690,Maria,2022-05-03,Convenient and comfortable The room was clean and the hotel in a good location for Temple Meads Station Would have expected some water in the room and perhaps a mini bar. No option to have breakfast in room or order a paper.
691,Leigh,2022-05-02,"Great location, comfy beds, friendly staff. Comfy bed, good shower, lots of storage. The guy on reception was really friendly and helpful. Dust in vent above door. I get hayfever so it made me sneeze."
692,Sharon,2022-05-02,"Superb The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was basic but had everything we needed and the bed was comfortable, and the location was good, about 10 minutes walk from the town centre. The showerhead was broken and couldn't be adjusted."

694,George,2022-05-02,"Overall it was good and I would stay again The breakfast options were good (buffet style) and the room was clean and well presented. Car park was small, luckily we got the last space! ¬£16 per night for parking is a little steep considering the price of the room."
695,Christian,2022-05-01,Nice experience in this hotel Reception was top. With a per effect solution to park the car. Quality of breakfast was good with a staff very friendly and professional Indication of access with private car

698,Vincent,2022-04-30,"Great loction Car parking outside hotel was brilliant, reception staff friendly, enough lifts and stairs to floor easy to find and use. Food delicious and quality excellent."
699,Toneblack,2022-04-30,Great Great location for my gig and city centre. Room was ideal for my one night stay with iron for my clothes. I did get message from hotel saying masks to be worn in all areas of hotel but when arriving no masks were being worn by staff or guests.
700,Correy,2022-04-29,"Perfect stay would return again and again Second stay within this hotel this year. I‚Äôd return again and again when coming to Bristol. Good location short Uber to everything you need. Rooms are all very modern and both stays we‚Äôve had no complaints with either room both different to eachother. All very clean. Nice area downstairs where you can eat ; drink or just grab a small snack. All staff friendly throughout the stay. Gym downstairs which I didn‚Äôt go in but had a peek and it seems alright. Highly recommend Room had a view of a scary looking abandoned car park which was a little unsettling but just kept the curtain closed , didn‚Äôt expect much of a view in Bristol city centre anyway"
701,Lynda,2022-04-28,Good value. Great location. Great location. Very handy for the railway station. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The bed needed upgraded.
702,Shannon,2022-04-27,Room was nice and staff were friendly. Did seem a bit overpriced. But stay was nice. Staff were nice. Breakfast was good. Room was nice. Seemed expensive.
703,Cheuk,2022-04-27,"Superb The staff were so nice and helpful, and the room is so clean and as it looks on the photos! Location is so close to Bristol Temple Meads station, just around 5 minutes walk, which is so convenient!"
704,Annabelle,2022-04-27,"Very lovely. Breakfast was lovely, staff were kind and helpful. During the fire evacuation, staff were calm and guided everyone very well. Only downside was the noise level of the bed, as you sat on it, it creaked and was loud throughout the night simply when tossing and turning."
705,Derek,2022-04-26,"Close to Temple Meads station, but a bit far from the centre. Noisy restaurant. Comfortable bed - firm mattress, firm pillows. Effective air conditioning. Nice view over garden. Better lighting - not easy to read unless in bed. TV was badly set up - I corrected it."

Thank you so much for the staff members to work hard for this. Sadly the room was cold at night, but we didn‚Äôt want to turn the heating on because of it made too much noise. We didn‚Äôt have a good sleep. So to make up, we looked forward for the breakfast in the morning(stayed in Hilton in Japan and I thought it was going to be great)but unfortunately, the breakfast quality was poor and we didn‚Äôt enjoy."

Staff are always lovely and friendly, plus they are happy to chat. Rooms are starting to need an update - for example no USB ports in sockets for charging devices. Lighting in this particular room (333) seemed to have a mind of it's own - would sometimes work and other times would randomly come on 5-10 mins after the switch was activated."

The fridge was switched off and was empty. The TV connection was poor so it was unwatchable and I couldn‚Äôt cast to the TV from my mobile as an alternative.
747,Biddyandbuster,2022-03-19,"One of the best chain hotels I have stayed in for room facilities, and cleanliness. There was a warm and genuine welcome from Bailey at reception, and we given all the info we needed on breakfast / dining and checkout etc. Reception was filled with the most wonderful fragrance too. The room was immaculately clean, very well laid out with plenty of storage. Having a fridge was a real benefit for milk and cold drinks. Although compact the bathroom had a good sized shower. I was delighted to see that there was magnifying mirror installed, and the heated mirror was a great feature. Breakfast was good and plentiful, but the evening meal was ok but nothing special. Staff throughout were lovely. The only thing that would prevent me from staying again is the fact that the bed was very uncomfortable for me. Too hard and very creaky. It is shame really as everything else was perfect."
748,Tuane,2022-03-13,"Really good. Very welcoming staff throughout the stay. Friendly staff, comfortable room, good location For a twin room, it would be nice to have two sets of toiletries."

Both breakfast and dinner were good and the dining-room spacious and comfortable. The quick checkout system made our departure easy. The location is great too. The twin room would be more comfortable with an extra chair.; one for each guest. The approach to the hotel was difficult because of building works along Temple Way and it's hard to find the entry to the car-park"

765,Laura,2022-02-08,"Very good The location was ideal. The room was clean and large. The bathroom was tidy and clean. The heated mirror in the bathroom was handy. The availability of parking.

779,Jason,2022-01-27,Superb The very friendly gentleman on reception allowed me to check in very early as my room was available. Getting into my room early after a 0630 flight was most welcome & greatly appreciated. It‚Äôs location close to the train station.

Hot buffet choice was good with quality ingredients but food was totally cold even freshly cooked sausages & beans chef bought out were still cold! Tomatoes & mushrooms were cold, dried up & hard. Very disappointed & never had to complain before about a hotel breakfast but just could not eat it. A refund was handled very well with member of staff on reception.

I gauge a hotel on ""would I stay here for a weekend getaway with the misses?"" Answer ""Yes!"" but I wouldn't take her here if it was our honeymoon... The Hotel is well presented. Plenty of car parking spaces. Easy access to the city of Bristol. The room was clean and spacious and well laid out. The Breakfast was plentiful in choices.

801,Roy,2021-12-27,"Great people. Staff were great. Facilities very nice. Breakfast very ordinary and good very overpriced in my view, paid ¬£16.95 for little more than mini fish and chips.

The room was on the small side but had a lovely view over the park. Good location for the Christmas market and Carbot Circus - about a 10 minute walk The room was small so a means to hang up coats on the way in would be useful as the wardrobe was difficult to access as it was close to the bed,"

832,Maarit,2021-12-01,"Superb The reception and breakfast as well as Recess dinner staff were lovely. The lady (seemed to be the manager) at breakfast was super busy, but still had time to have a little chat with us which was very nice. The breakfast itself was delicious. The selection was nice and the food looked good on display. The reception offered us a bigger room, because we were travelling with a baby. That made us feel seen and understood. Thank you. The Recess dinner menu in our opinion was a bit overpriced. The portions were small. But the food itself was delicious."
833,John,2021-11-29,"Great trip to the Hilton Nice room, plenty of facilities and the guest service was nice when I asked for new towels. The waiting service was excellent and we both liked the food. Minibar could have been stocked and the TV remote might not have been working properly."
834,Henry,2021-11-29,"All in, good. Disappointed with the food Room was nice, clean, very happy generally. Good location I was told there was a vegan breakfast, and paid 9.99 for it. However, it was just the sides of others - prefer it if you didn't advertise it as vegan, when it's just mushrooms, tomatoes, beans and greens."

836,Rebecca,2021-11-28,"Superb Clean comfortable room, friendly staff.... spotless front of house. Well done all."
837,Lynette,2021-11-26,"Very good central location, nice restaurant and very pleasant staff"
838,Paul,2021-11-24,We have stayed before so knew what to expect and will be happy to stay again Breakfast was excellent. Overall a good experience
839,Jan,2021-11-24,"Enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back. The hotel was in a good location, walking distance to the train station and the city centre. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and attentive, especially Leonardo who served behind the bar. We were place on the laundry floor and could hear the machines in the middle of the night."
840,Michael,2021-11-24,comfortable stay nice and easy access to rooms etc. Very difficult to find the car park due to roads closed nearby. A route map would of been handy.
841,Jackie,2021-11-24,"Comfortable stay - little overpriced About 15 mins walk from Bristol Hippodrome. Staff great. Room size ok, mini cooler kept water cool, bed firm which I like and pillows comfy. Excellent choice of breakfast and good value at ¬£10 - included full english, pastries, continental, juice, fruit, cereal etc even had a decaf latte!!! Comfortable bar/restaurant. No usb ports in room - bit gutted as I didn't think to take the plug for phone so couldn't charge but in fairness description didn't say it so can't complain really. Comfortable stay but overall a little expensive - 180 for a double room. No info in room on safety procedures, restaurant opening times, bar menu etc."
842,Lorna,2021-11-24,"¬£94 for a room was more than I would normally pay but the hotel still made it value for money for good Bristol location location,"
843,Jacqueline,2021-11-23,"great for a short stay location great , twin room clean and comfortable"
844,Jennifer,2021-11-23,"Good location for the city , friendly welcoming staff Very helpful and friendly staff . Good location , parking on site . Restaurant on site."
845,Sam,2021-11-22,Si senor give the ball to Diaz parking right out the front of the hotel. short walk to the city centre I believe I got a good price for the hotel so I got good value for money as the rooms were comfortable and they had orchard pig cider in the bar couple with a bererton Diaz equaliser for rovers I‚Äôll take a point back up north content. Bristol is excellent. nothing
846,Shannon,2021-11-21,"Very good Receptionist and restaurant staff were very friendly and happy to help. Had a great nights sleep No parking, we had to pay ¬£53 in another car park for 2 nights !! The hotel should offer discount for certain car parks around the city for the people staying at the hotwl"
847,Dina,2021-11-21,comfortable comfort show room
848,Andrea,2021-11-20,"pleasant stay, would recommend for a short break to Bristol Clean, comfortable, modern. Good basic facilities bed was squeaky, but not a major issue"
849,Perry,2021-11-20,Perfect for a short stay Clean and modern All good nothing not to like.
850,Jeff,2021-11-19,"We liked the hotel itself and all the staff we had dealings with were courteous and very helpful. We did have lunch in t Good location for us. Room clean and comfortable, loved the extra large bed. Double glazing amazing, couldn‚Äôt hear a sound from the busy road below, (we were on 4th floor). Large TV was great. Staff friendly and helpful. En suite facilities a little on the small side, but clean and in good condition."
851,Beth,2021-11-18,"short and very sweet! great and central, exactly what I needed. comfy room, nice staff and a good breakfast I perhaps wouldn‚Äôt stay more than a few nights as it‚Äôs right on a busy main road ‚Ä¶ However the rooms are soundproof, so absolutely no issues with sleeping!"
852,Rachel,2021-11-17,"Good location, rooms a little small The location is good for the station and the town centre. Lifts are very quick! The park opposite is a nice green space. Room was well equipped. Clean facilities and pleasant staff. The shower room is very small but the shower is powerful. The bed was quite firm (not as comfy as a Premier Inn bed!). The hotel is on a very busy road so quite noisy. The receptionist moved us to a room at the back which is quieter. She did this unasked when she saw our age and how long we were staying (4 nights) which was kind."
853,Radosveta,2021-11-17,"We had a pleasant stay. Overall a comfortable hotel, great location. The room was very clean and the bed comfortable. It was very noisy in the late afternoon/early evening. The entrance to the parking was quite difficult to find."
854,Mcdougall,2021-11-16,"Great place shame about the breakfast The room, the breakfast and the location were all excellent. I thought that the breakfast were included in the price"
855,Kevin,2021-11-13,Overall vey good and I would return Room and location. Only thing was that the breakfast buffet had the worst sausages I have ever had in my long life.
856,Ioannis,2021-11-13,"Very good Clean and cosy hotel with nice breakfast Our fridge wasn't working and although the receptionists knew it, we were not informed and we had to explicitly ask for it to be fixed, once we discovered it. Also, we felt that the staff at the breakfast area were always in a hurry to close before time, as they started cleaning, and taking our dishes at 9.45 and that was a bit stressful."
857,Edward,2021-11-11,Nice enough Clean room Took a long time to check in. Parking is awful!
858,Afolayan,2021-11-11,"Was good in general. Good location, I think the carpet in the rooms needs to be changed. Carpet."
859,Allana,2021-11-09,"great birthday night away and would recommend to others. friendly and well mannered staff, clean hotel and good location to walk into the city centre a little pricey for the car park but I suppose it‚Äôs to be expected in a city,"
860,Ann,2021-11-09,"Very happy with the hotel. Would definitely stay there again. Breakfast was very good value for money. I'm gluten intolerant, staff very kindly arranged gluten free toast every morning. Pointed out what was safe to eat. Room was clean and comfortable. There's a little mini fridge in the room. Really handy . Location is 5 mins from Bristol temple meads train station. Quiet at night. Lovely restaurant & nice choice of food. We felt the room was cold on arrival. We tried to alter the air conditioning, but still blew cold air. Turned it off. Shower was not strong enough, weak water pressure. Apart from that our weekend was really great."
861,Evelyn,2021-11-09,Restful My stay at the hotel was everything I expected to be and the staff were exceptional - Even though we arrived at 1040 for breakfast on the Saturday the choice and quality was far better than I expected and the experience and friendliness of the catering staff was a exceptional - A good kick start to a very full itinerary on that day. HOWEVER I telephoned a few days prior to the visit to correct an error in the booking and ask a question about parking - After a strange delay in connection my enquiry - which I considered to be perfectly valid - was dealt with in a less than courteous manner and I rang off with the unacceptable feeling of 'Why Did I Bother ? and that same error was present on my booking when I arrived - Yet the very nice lady at the reception corrected it with a smile and no hassle. My actual stay was superb and my colleague was exceedingly pleased as well. See above and in my particular room felt the bathroom was a little cramped but entirely functional - The tightness had obviously been experienced before as the toilet roll holder had received a knock or something before and was loose on the wall. - Plus i would have liked a better hook behind the door for my dressing gown. Plus = Apart from a group of men that were very much into their cups at 3am on the Sunday morning and who decided to discuss when they should meet the next day outside my door {But this was not the fault of the hotel and well beyond their care} - Overall I was very impressed with the quietness in the room and we both slept extremely well
862,Harry,2021-11-08,Good value. Very clean room. Comfy bed. Common areas and hallways are a little shabby.
863,Angela,2021-11-08,comfortable stay comfy bed breakfast was a bit cold
864,Stuart,2021-11-07,above average comfortable clean and convenient with a very good breakfast no where to park as car park was full. spent ages trying to find somewhere
865,Terri,2021-11-06,"Exceeded my expectations, would stay again! Was very impressed with this hotel. For the price of the room I wasn‚Äôt expecting amazing things, however upon arrival I was very surprised. I was immediately greeted with a very clean lobby and friendly reception staff. The room we had was on the top floor which meant a lovely view, the room was very large, clean and well presented. To show that nobody had been in the room after housekeeping, stickers were placed over the doors which I think is a brilliant idea considering covid circumstances ect. There was also a mini fridge in the room which was a delight! Definitely worth the money!! We also tried out the bar and had some food which was delicious. The servers were incredibly polite and everything was priced very fairly for the quality!! The hotel itself is a 5 minute walk from the train station and was in a perfect location!"
866,Christopher,2021-11-06,A quick getaway it‚Äôs location to we‚Äôre we wanted to go. The staff. we‚Äôre friendly. and welcoming the room was clean and comfortable Amdahl while the gym was small it was well equipped for anyone needing their exercise fix. the only disappointing thing was breakfast on the first morning they appeared to have difficulty keeping up with demand with some items. Unless you were getting your food close to coming out of te kitchen it it cold very quickly.
867,John,2021-11-05,"Great location, comfy bed, clean facilities. Friendly staff. Breakfast could be improved. Room was fine. Bed was comfortable. Temperature was easy to control. As I was there for work I didn't stay in the room that much. The bathroom was small, but serviceable and clean. Shower was good! Breakfast was average - buffets are a hard thing to get right. The breakfast could have been better. I know hot buffets are never as good as freshly cooked food, but this one was a little on the lukewarm side. It was fine. But it wasn't game-changing. I ate at local cafes the following days."
868,Vanessa,2021-11-04,"Clean rooms Receptionist upgraded our room for a double bed instead of twin bed at no extra cost There is only one option of parking which is ¬£16 for 24 hours, which I thought was a bit expensive."
869,Uma,2021-11-04,"Great stay, Lovely reception staff, Clean hotel Room was clean Hotel in a good location as I am an avid walker thus nothing was too far. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel. a Tesco, Pret and Gregs is nearby so didn't have breakfast at the hotel. Room was not cleaned on a daily basis - you had to make a request at reception the night before if you wanted the room cleaned. This was due to maintaining social distancing post CV. I think a sign outside the door should suffice if you didn't want the room to be cleaned. This is not an issue really but wanted to share as a FYI only."
870,John,2021-11-02,very nice helpful receptionist really enhanced our stay reasonable price and receptionist was very helpful and professional - let us check in early which was really helpful as we were on a short break 3 nights and our time was limited. Also allowed us to store our luggage on the day if checkout rooms a little small but overall was good value for money
871,Holly,2021-11-02,Very good Very welcoming! Cherry looked after us and showed us interesting places to visit and bars to go that were around Bristol - we had a lovely time! :)
872,Helen,2021-11-02,great very clean
873,Samantha,2021-11-01,Good Breakfast was good room comfy For the price of the room expected breakfast to be included also carpark is ¬£16 for 24hrs but you only get the room for 21hrs
874,Jayne,2021-11-01,"Lovely Hotel in Bristol Very clean hotel, lovely staff great breakfast"
875,Guanyao,2021-10-31,Good Clean. nice staff nice location Room next to elevator a bit noisy at night
876,Vickers,2021-10-31,Good Staff friendly and helpful. Good cocktails. Comfy beds. Fridge in rooms a bonus. No hassles. Not too far from the centre but area not too inspiring. A nice little park and ruin next to it though which helped. The hotel is generic but I didn't expect anything else. A decent stay all in all.
877,Helen,2021-10-31,Sleek and smart beds were large and comfortable modern decor large windows overlooking park swivel chair! parking was stressful approach to hotel with building works was terrible. hotel should provide instructions as at least one road was closed and meant we had to turn round twice to get access.
878,Nichola,2021-10-30,Very good It was in a good location and close to Temple Meads station. Nothing.
879,Peter,2021-10-30,Very good Staff were all very helpful and friendly - as I am quite used to with most Hilton properties
880,Andrew,2021-10-29,"Bristol is a great city, and the hotel met all of our requirements. The hotel is close to the station, and just a 5 or 10 minute walk to the central areas. First impressions are that the hotel is smart, bright, clean and business-like. Staff were welcoming and helpful. Rooms were a decent size and comfortable, self-service breakfasts were of good quality with plenty of choice. The design and decor is conservative, nothing special, but that is purely a matter of personal taste, and I have no criticisms."
881,Russell,2021-10-29,ideal hotel for our 3 night stay The hotel was central and easy walking distance to docks and shopping centres Nothing
882,Alexis,2021-10-28,"Superb Room was well equipped bed comfy and was very impressed with the soundproofing. Our room overlooked a busy road and there was absolutely no traffic noise. Very helpful and friendly staff. Ambiance of the bar wasn't very appealing. Also, the drink cans we bought to take to our room were very expensive."
883,Funbi,2021-10-28,"I had a good stay and staff were very friendly and the room was nice The room was really nice and I liked the view I would have liked to have dinner in my room, but there was no room service"

885,Dave,2021-10-25,"Location superb, handy for station, bars, pubs, sight seeing Location superb, very quiet, comfortable, cosy, plenty of tea and coffee, great place"
886,Philippa,2021-10-25,"Very good Clean, comfortable room. Parking was very difficult as was access due to closed roads etc."
887,Andrew,2021-10-25,Good value for money hotel. I was given a rear facing room as the hotel was not overly busy.
888,856283839,2021-10-25,Very good We had an amazing dinner at the hotel restaurant. The staff there was particularly nice and they made us feel very welcome.
889,Nicola,2021-10-24,"Relaxing and comfortable, in a good location. Great value for money The location was fantastic for getting into the city centre. Staff were friendly and helpful. The shower was always hot, bed very comfortable and the bar/restaurant area was great too."
890,Mark,2021-10-24,"Enjoyable relaxing stay, would stay again especially considering how wonderful staff. Breakfast very good, good variety of cold or cooked food. Had one evening meal which was again very good, although slightly restricted menu. Staff are brilliant both in the restaurant and on reception, so friendly, chatty and helpful. Great location city centre 20 minute walk, restaurants 10 - 15 minutes. 20 minutes to harbour with historic sites and buzzing cafes, bars and restaurants. The bed - hard, lumpy with very noisy springs, couldn't move without twangs, grinds and clunks,"
891,Raj,2021-10-24,"Great Staff, Food and Location Staff members were great. Any help you ask for..they were able to help Food - Had dinner and breakfast once. Brilliant food. Location - 10-15 mins walk to all the places - railway station, City Centre, Cabot circus for shopping and near the bus station Room - The room was adapted for guests with disability. so found it difficult for us to move around the room Bed - Bed was little hard / rigid"
892,Grace,2021-10-23,"Girls night away It was very central to shopping and lots of restaurants and bars only a short walk away. Good location, nice and quiet so got a good nights sleep too. The parking was an issue as the hotel is hard to drive too when you don‚Äôt know Bristol well. Maybe instructions should be written clearer."
893,Craig,2021-10-23,Perfect base for a stay in Bristol. Friendly staff. Very clean. Good location. Friendly and helpful staff No issues to discuss. Very satisfied.
894,Olive,2021-10-22,"Will stay again Served my last minute need as I forfeited the other place I paid to stay I was safe, staff very helpful. Clean room"
895,Julie,2021-10-22,Get up really early for breakfast!!! Room was clean and the beds were incredibly comfortable. Breakfast. Queues were really long and items were constantly running out. Poor staff were run ragged. Much better to book a time at reception as in other hotels to manage the flow of traffic and improve customer experience. It is not a cheap hotel after all.
896,John,2021-10-20,Very good Good and plenty of choice.
897,Iain,2021-10-20,Great hotel.. Wonderful staff.. It was all goodüëç Staff are great and the location is perfect for central Bristol.. I will use this hotel as my regular stay..
898,Andy,2021-10-20,"OK but for a Hilton Hotel would expect more client service. Room was nice, staff excellent and location is very good. parking is a bit steep when you are a paying guest. Breakfast was cold and you had to do it all of yourself, make your own hot drink, toast and serve yourself so not really value for money and for it to then be cold ? Had better food in a weatherspoon I am afraid."
899,Fifiminkle,2021-10-19,Bristol trip  Comfy bed. Friendly staff. Good value for money.
900,Rodney,2021-10-18,"Good location, great value for money, very clean with helpful friendly staff Very good selection of cereal juices and cooked item Staff where very helpful Nothing"
901,Neil,2021-10-18,Very good Location was good for railway station. Breakfast was ideal with plenty of options. Price for the 3 nights was high but given that the Bristol marathon was on that weekend prices are always inflated because of the demand. Expensive but guess that's what hotels do alas..
902,Brown,2021-10-16,"Did what was needed. Parking is bad, over charged on parking. Confusing bill payment. Cheaper parking and more parking. Options to have a cold breakfast as an alternative to paying for both hot and cold regardless."
903,Yee,2021-10-15,Superb Self service laundry. Good for drying clothes in rainy day. Poor sound proofing
904,Christine,2021-10-14,"Weekend Trip Great location not far from the station and the city centre. Corridor a little noisy at night, otherwise a lovely stay."
905,Paul,2021-10-13,Very good Breakfast. Room. Staff. Gym. Price. Room size.
906,David,2021-10-13,"Very good  The address, Temple Way and post code when inputted to a sat nav takes you to the front of the hotel, which has no access by car far from Temple Way. You have to arrive at the back of the hotel to park."
907,Yasmin,2021-10-12,"Exceptional breakfast and staff Breakfast and staff were exceptional. Fresh waffles and knowledgable, helpful and friendly staff who showed us where to go on a map they provided which tailored to our needs. Couple of minutes walk from the city centre and the harbour. Slightly pricey but it's a hilton. Room a bit on the small side but fine."
908,Jeff,2021-10-12,"Ideal location, very comfortable, lovely staff Great location in walking distance of the city & harbour area. Bus stops right outside the door. Superb breakfast being replenished constantly so fresh and hot, caters for all. Queen room was very small, but was clean and comfortable. Helpful friendly staff making you feel very welcomed. Queen room was disappointingly quite small, but was clean and comfortable."
909,Esme,2021-10-11,Superb Nice big comfortable room. Very clean and nice service.
910,Kat,2021-10-10,"Standard but good value Very clean, friendly service with fast check in and check out. Good value, walking distance to the centre. Hard to find using standard maps! You have to access from the one way systems, which took us a while! The bed was hard, but the room was otherwise very comfortable!"
911,Brian,2021-10-09,Superb The upbeat and obliging staff The coffee making machine.....it's the first time I have encountered problems with such a device
912,Rachel,2021-10-09,"Very good The location was perfect for us. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Cherry! The bed was to hard for us."
913,James,2021-10-09,"Very good Great location in centre of town. Limited parking outside hotel, I got the last space. Parking is expensive. Breakfast was very good and don‚Äôt have to checkout till 12. Expensive, parking"

917,Sue,2021-09-30,"Short break in Bristol Good location about 10 minutes walk from the station and within walking distance of the main attractions, pubs and restaurants. Nice restaurant serving excellent food. Comfortable, quiet and extremely clean room with a nice view of Temple Gardens at the back of the hotel. Small gym but enough for a short break. Friendly, welcoming staff. Nothing."
918,Steve,2021-09-28,Very good Super location and staff excellent
919,Ranadi,2021-09-28,Exceptional staff upgraded our overall experience from meh to very good! The housecleaning and reception staff were exceptionally helpful and very friendly. Comfy beds. Handy for the trains and bus links and only a short walk to the city centre Fridge in our room smelt funny Coffee machine was broken and buffet cold meats and cheeses were uncovered so guests were able to cough over it - so we went down the road to Barrista's for a good coffee and light breakfast for the rest of our stay. Seemed pricey for what was offered
920,Enrico,2021-09-27,"Superb position is walking distance from city center, professional and kind staff nice restaurant with good food and beer using excuse of covid to stop cleaning the room and restoring room supplies (shampoo, showegel, coffee, etc...)"

923,Ayesha,2021-09-22,"All good Breakfast was great, staff very friendly and helpful, the only downside was the location really as it is a little out of the way from the centre of Bristol but it‚Äôs very handy for getting to the train station"
924,Nick,2021-09-20,"Will be happy to stay here again Decent location, clean facilities and friendly staff. Duty manager who was actually finished for the day, was particularly helpful when I was locked out of my room as the key card got deactivated. Stayed at this chain of hotels before and had hoped for a coffee machine but just had a basic kettle. Friendly staff but check in took ages and not everyone likes chit chat. Just glad I got there before the coach tour party checked in."
925,David,2021-09-20,"an excelent venue,well situated to accessing the attractions the city of Bristol Breakfast,good selection plus excelent staff. Evening meal ,limited selection but well presented and tasty. Room facilities excelent and comfortable. Staff always cheerfull and very helpful A bit of difficulty accessing hotel because of ongoing traffic development in the area,maybe could have advised customers in advance"
926,Philip,2021-09-20,convenient and comfortable. Good location. Had air con. Good bar. Helpful staff even later at night. Nothing really.

931,Jia,2021-09-14,"Very nice and close to centre! Had lots of fun just shame about the fridge cooler Great staff and very clean, and well air conditioned The fridge cooler was not actually cold or working and was the same as room temperature so we couldn't leave any fizzy drinks and leftover take away food inside to keep overnight for next day, although the staff offered kindly to take our stuff for us, we felt little bad to bother them Tuesday morning there was a fire alarm kind of going on and off in the morning but we weren't told about a ""check"" because it went off after 5 seconds. Then started again then stopped again"
932,Darksilver,2021-09-13,Good Clean and comfortable An alarm went off both mornings apparently it could be to do with steam from showers

935,Linda,2021-09-11,"Very good The hotel was nice and central, clean and bright with friendly staff We had to pay an extortionate amount for parking which was not very clear when we booked. We did get an email regarding this but after we booked. The parking cost needs to be clearer at time of actual booking. We were lucky to get a space. If the hotel/city had been busier parking would have been an issue."
936,Roman,2021-09-10,Good food and drink and service .But parking on site was expensive.  Parking expensive.
937,Beverley,2021-09-09,A enjoyable break that wasn't spoilt by the hotel but only enhanced by it. Location to train station n city centre.and the staff was very accomendating. No issues to report
938,Helen,2021-09-08,"Very good The location being just out of the main hub of the city and by Temple gardens which was great, and therefore not so busy. The staff were wonderful and friendly. The facilities were great, and everywhere was very clean which was reassuring. The only downside to the stay was the constant white noise buzzing in the room (from the air/heating con I presume - even though I had the system on the off button) which was annoying at night and did not make for a very restful night's sleep. Ear plugs came in handy. But that was the only downside to an otherwise great stay."
939,David,2021-09-07,"Good hotel for city break or business travel. Nice city centre hotel, good value for money. Nice room, decent breakfast. Easy to walk and get something to eat. Free parking from 6pm till 8am then you need to pay. All in all it is as expected, if not slightly better."

943,Mariya,2021-09-03,"Very good The staff at Bristol is absolutely lovely. Friendly, helpful, gracious and really kind. It was impressive. The location was a little tired. Hilton's in general are not great value for money: rooms are way too small given the price."
944,Jodie,2021-09-03,Superb It was a convenient location close to all amenities - the staff were really welcoming expecially Peter at the reception desk who couldn‚Äôt do enough to help us throughout our stay The parking situation - when the car park was full the hotel allowed people to park in unmarked bays meaning at 10am when I came to leave I couldn‚Äôt as a work van was blocking me in - this is annoying having paid ¬£32 for two days parking only to be blocked in and the hotel allowing it as they know how much they have taken in parking fees why would they continue to take money and allow people to park there blocking others and Delaying my exit by around 30 mins

948,Abigail,2021-08-30,"Very good The rooms were lovely but I booked a garden view and got a view of the building across the road. Booked a afternoon tea for two, waitress wasn‚Äôt overly helpful as it seems it was too much hassle to do the afternoon tea. After we finished and left the restaurant had many phone calls chasing payment but I had already told them what room we were staying in and to put the payment on the room before we sat down in restaurant ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
949,Michelle,2021-08-30,"Good clean, good staff room small, bathroom very small, no bath. no fridge"
950,Helen,2021-08-29,Hilton Gardens Inn Hotel Very clean and staff couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful and friendly Nothing
951,Michelle,2021-08-28,Very enjoyable Excellent location. Friendly helpful staff Vegetarian sausages for breakfast
952,Richard,2021-08-27,Generally high standard throughout. Very high standard of accommodation and general hotel facilities and staffing with especially helpful reception staff Access to the various parking facilities was difficult to negotiate and more information in advance would have been helpful
953,Carolyn,2021-08-26,"Good location, clean and comfortable Good location being only a short walk from Bristol Temple Meads station. We were going to a gig at the Exchange and it was a short walk from there as well. The hotel is clean and relatively comfortable. We had a snack in the bar which was very good. It had all the things we needed for a weekend. Nothing I didn't like"
954,Stephen,2021-08-25,Convenient hotel for centre. Clean with friendly staff Location good for the centre of Bristol. Hotel clean and staff friendly. Thought ¬£16 expensive for car parking.
955,Kushlani,2021-08-25,"Good Central location and was clean. Breakfast was not well organised and seemed bit chaotic at times. Tables were not cleared promptly, no hot water for tea and had to ask. Breakfast was not worth the amount charged."
956,Val,2021-08-24,"Excellent location, staff and value for money. Everything was fine. Too many requests for feedback!"
957,Andy,2021-08-24,Superb Clean hotel in a great location for our needs with friendly staff
958,David,2021-08-23,"Good Good Location clean staff very helpful No bottled water in room ,parking limited and quite expensive"
959,Geraldine,2021-08-23,"This was our first visit to Btistol, we thoroughly enjoyed it, lots to see and do. Breakfast was very good lots of choices. The location is also very good. No complaints about stay."
960,Michael,2021-08-23,Its one of the better value class hotels in Bristol - who need say more Its just a very nice big modern hotel with all creature comforts - it has a few parking spaces which you must pay not a small fee for but if you know the Bristol parking situation you will snap one up at that price quite happily - i stayed twice and parked there twice Nothing negative to report only the car parkign situation which is horrid all over Bristol and no fault of the Hotels at all
961,Andrew,2021-08-23,Mask wearing The hotel was in a great location and the staff were very welcoming and accommodating. You are informed before your arrival and there are signs in the hotel that customers are expected to wear masks when in the general areas of the hotel. This was not policed however and was particularly concerning in the buffet breakfast area where people were leaning over the food without masks on and with no checks that people had sanitised their hands.
962,Anthony,2021-08-21,"dry, over heated, probaly not fresh enough . Location great. room - modern and comfortable. breakfast - poor and dried out"
963,Palwinder,2021-08-20,"Very good Room service was too good, staff was very friendly and helpfull. bed and room furniture was looks very old."
964,Sheena,2021-08-20,Very good Small fridge in the room was really useful. Quiet rooms - no noisy neighbours...
965,David,2021-08-19,Superb Fairly central Road works made approach difficult
966,Yvonne,2021-08-19,Excellent Breakfast nice
967,Leon,2021-08-17,"Very good Clean, friendly staff. Nice restaurant Little tricky to find as postcard takes you to a different hotel and the main access road to the hotel was blocked off."
968,Andrew,2021-08-16,"City break gem Friendly welcoming staff, plentiful breakfast buffet (although not as fresh on Monday morning). Cannot fault the location for all Bristol attractions and Temple Meads station. Like all chain hotels, it is a little sterile and featureless. Also, to have to keep requesting small housekeeping / room items started to become a little tiresome. As we emerge from Covid, please could we investigate reinstating some way of saying ‚Äúplease service my room‚Äù."
969,Rumana,2021-08-15,"It was definitely good! room, location I explained before I need gluten free, dairy free diet. Staff at the breakfast floor were not well prepared for this. I would have liked to see gluten free cereal options."
970,Liam,2021-08-15,Weekend away Very good location and good staff Found a pair of old dirty knickers in one of the bed side table which was very very grim
971,Albert,2021-08-14,Superb It does what it say on the box
972,Martin,2021-08-13,Superb Close to my work Noise of people out side front door smoking early in morning
973,Zoe,2021-08-12,Superb  Parking was full
974,Gareth,2021-08-12,"Location was great, staff were very polite, breakfast was great Location was great, staff were very polite, breakfast was great. The TV had no TV Guide available."

976,Kay,2021-08-09,Good Clean and tidy Lots of cleaning in evidence Staff very helpful The room was too hot for me - even with air conditioning Lots of customers had no masks . The staff were all masked which I appreciated
977,Minnette,2021-08-09,Superb The room was a large one Car parking facilities a bit restricted
978,Robert,2021-08-09,"Great Great location, clean, felt safe Nothing really, odd stains on wall and carpet"
979,Diane,2021-08-09,"ok for a couple of nights alone but room on the small size for two The room was fine and understand why have to request extra supplies. Check out was easy. Bathroom supplies good. Felt buffet breakfast a bit too much at these times. Would have preferred to be served. Ham was frozen, fruit choice poor. Location was ok, but the parking price was extortionate. Menu lacked interesting things, very basic but prices very high. Freeview TV lacked many basic channels."
980,Stephen,2021-08-09,Superb Hotel was perfect for a three night stay in central Bristol. Breakfast was excellent and the overriding positive was the warmth and friendliness of the staff. A well motivated and excellent team of people throughout. Size of room particularly the bathroom. Orange juice at breakfast was a little weak. Otherwise everything else was very good.
981,Michelle,2021-08-08,Very good Location easy to get about to attractions Some information should be provided about the location of the parking as not easily accessible due to roadworks.
982,Donna,2021-08-07,"Really convenient, comfy and good value for money Shower was larger than in previous rooms I have stayed in. Very nice Although I had travelled by coach and found it easily from the station my friend travelled by car and found it difficult to access the car park."
983,Ian,2021-08-07,Superb  Handy for station and town
984,Katie,2021-08-05,"Comfortable, very clean The bed was very comfy, the cleaning standards were also top notch with partnership with detol. Location was a bit of a walk to the centre about 20 mins, we thought it was closer but our mistake. I must admit, it did seem quite standard for a hotel. It reminded me of just a brand new premier inn, there were no ‚Äúluxuries‚Äù with the stay."
985,Jenny,2021-08-03,Good Comfortable clean bedroom and en suite and reasonable breakfast with lovely coffee
986,Theresa,2021-08-01,Great hotel Location..cleans rooms and good breakfast
987,Shaun,2021-08-01,"Parking  Parking, getting into the car park was extremely difficult with all the work that was going on around the hotel. A more detailed explanation on the web site on how to‚Äùget there‚Äù would have helped !"
988,Marcela,2021-08-01,Very good Good value for money. Location not so good
989,Alistair,2021-07-31,Very good Room was clean and bed was comfy. Pillows could have been more firm.

991,T,2021-07-30,"Very good The staff , very friendly and helpful . Especially when they have to put up with rude guests. The bed wasn't very comfortable , but it would do for 2 sleeps. The coffee in the room was horrid."
992,Sarah,2021-07-29,Superb  Car park quite tight. Everything else great.

994,Ferdian,2021-07-29,"Good place to stay Clean room and close proximity to Cabot Circus and Bristol Temple Meads. Soap and shampoo could be more,"
995,Sue,2021-07-26,"Very comfortable hotel, near the City centre The breakfast was fantastic and staff were friendly‚Ä¶. Great location for discovering what Bristol has to offer Telling us about roadworks around the hotel as we couldn‚Äôt get to the car park"
996,Yvonne,2021-07-26,Lovely stay and handy for train station I stayed here to meet up with my husband. We then drove onto north Cornwall the next day! We had onsite car parking. Hotel about 6 minutes walk to Bristol temple meads train station. Rooms were comfortable and very clean. It overlooks a lovely park that we walked through. Air conditioning was so handy with the weather being so hot.
997,Veerle,2021-07-25,"Leave your car at home Big room, good bed, air on, soft linen, quiet. It was very hard to find with google maps because of blocked roads."
998,Charlotte,2021-07-24,"Very good The location was perfect, bed was very comfy."
999,Mayuko,2021-07-22,"Great breakfast but basic room for the price Great breakfast, good fitness room and useful location Room was very basic, tiny toilet, air con very old fashioned and TV lacking many standard Freeview channels"

1001,Jonathan,2021-07-17,Great place to stay Clean covid secure environment. Car parking very crowded and tricky to manoeuvre in.
1002,Caroline,2021-07-17,Nice hotel and friendly staff The outside area to sit and have a drink was nice. Cot they put in the room was large and bedding included. The car parking charge and that the wrong room type was allocated at first. Had to wait a while to get a new room.
1003,Isham,2021-07-15,Great location. Lady at front desk gave amazing customer service. Price was expensive just for 1 night. Parking a bit annoying too not being able to book in advance.
1004,Alan,2021-07-15,excellent value very nice staff and v clean hotelsingle beds v narrow single beds v narrow
1005,Kornelija,2021-07-13,"xxx What I loved the most is the staff: so friendly helpful and kind, but apart from that, everything's been decent - brilliant! For such a price...happy days lol x Quick quick, man's hungry. Ain't your fault tho haha"
1006,Suzanne,2021-07-12,Superb Room clean and tidy. Lovely breakfast staff excellent Peter on reception was very friendly. We really loved this hotel only one annoying thing which wasn‚Äôt the hotels fault. The stay was perfect apart from Saturday night Inconsiderate lads moving from room to room keeping me awake for over 3 hours and we didnt get to sleep till 4am. Shouting and being a complete nuisance.
1007,Chris,2021-07-08,Superb Peter on reception very helpful and the restaurant manageress very good. hard-working too Rooms a little small for 2
1008,Mary,2021-07-04,"Very good  I don't like breakfast room, restaurant and bar all being the same room."

1010,Mabel,2021-07-03,Comfy stay Buffet breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff. Room was clean. Key card kept needing to be reset at front desk. Got a new keycard midway through the stay which solved the issue
1011,Hilary,2021-06-30,Superb Very good location with car parking. Very comfortable bed and all very clean. Good shower. Helpful staff. Our 3rd stay and will definitely return.
1012,Sheila,2021-06-30,Very good Closeness to the station visiting family
1013,Paul,2021-06-28,"Would go back, but request room away from lifts Location great. Staff friendly/helpful If I had to add a negative, room was near lifts (elevators) so quite a bit of noise from lift motors."
1014,Gaynor,2021-06-28,Very good We really enjoyed meeting Paulo who was very friendly and welcoming to us on our first night stay. The extras mount up and I would have preferred to have car parking and breakfast included.
1015,Chuck,2021-06-27,Superb The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The food was excellent too. The cost for the room is similar to London prices.
1016,Timothy,2021-06-23,"Overnight stay Good location and felt very COVID safe, staff very polite and made you feel very welcome, explain evacuation procedures due to having my mum who has walking difficult. The breakfast was to a very high standard and again following government guidelines. Parking very limited"
1017,Hannah,2021-06-20,4* not what it used to be The room and rest of hotel was impeccably clean. The staff were very polite and friendly The gym was great - had the whole place to myself (due to COVID) restrictions. Breakfast was lovely. The Hilton brand used to carry a premium reputation however some of their hotels are not much different now to a stay in a premier inn. The room itself was average. Fairly small with a bathroom that needed TLC (peeling ceiling and generally tired). The air con was also noisy and limp making sleeping on a hot night difficult.
1018,Naomi,2021-06-19,"Good location, clean and friendly. Clean room, friendly staff, great location. The bed wasn‚Äôt very comfortable but we were only staying one night so it wasn‚Äôt such a drama."
1019,Sue,2021-06-14,"Lovely hotel in great position Hotel is in an excellent position a short walk from the river and man attractions. It has the added bonus of on site parking for ¬£16 a day, which runs from the time that you hack in, so we were able to leave the car there after check out while we went out for dine lunch. (Worth noting when you are thinking about the time to arrive) Staff were friendly and helpful, single beds comfortable and a decent size and it‚Äôs really nice to stay somewhere that allows you to leave the hectic main City behind after a days site seeing. Loads of great bars and restaurants in walking distance and a quiet tranquil park opposite the hotel. Highly recommended. The air con wasn‚Äôt working and even though we reported it, no one came to fix it. It did leave the room a bit uncomfortable at night but not enough to stop us returning another time."
1020,Gregjc,2021-06-11,"June trip Room clean and in good repair, staff were helpful. Selection of channels and user interface was on tv was very poor"
1021,Marian,2021-06-08,Post code Easy to walk into town and nice quiet location with excellent staff Finding it! Hotel entrance cannot be located using hotel post code Visitors need to be warned that entrance is in a different post code
1022,Sue,2021-06-06,"Nice hotel. Excellent staff. Comfy pillows. Hard bed. VERY loud aircon. Staff were VERY good. The bed was really hard, and the Aircon was so loud! I didn‚Äôt get any sleep at all due to this and unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt turn it off as the room was VERY hot. The shower had mold üôà"
1023,Richard,2021-06-05,"Very good Friendly staff greeting on arrival, cleanliness, facilities in room and breakfast Location due to roadwork diversions. Bed was very uncomfortable and creaked badly throughout the night when moving - did not sleep a wink."
1024,Phill,2021-06-04,"Pleasant stay with a comfy bed We have stayed few times before but this time the breakfast was not good, the cooked breakfast wasnt hot and dried out. This was disappointed as we were looking forward to a good hot breakfast. We did request a quite room but was given room right next to lift so we had to request a room change. The breakfast and no information on how to access your car park as it took us 20 mins driving around trying g to find the way in due to all the building works and road closures."
1025,Paula,2021-06-03,"Great location - loved Bristol Location was great, central to everything. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend!"
1026,James,2021-06-03,Kingsize room (normal room with bigger bed) The staff were very friendly and covid safe. The breakfast was good lots to goose from with vegetarian options. Safe parking and good facilities. The room wasn‚Äôt what was described.
1027,Susan,2021-06-02,Good The hotel was close to the city centre and was very quiet. The car parking prices were extremely high
1028,Sian,2021-06-02,One night stay Excellent attentive staff. Evening meal very good. Breakfast was ok
1029,Courtney,2021-06-01,"Superb The staff were so helpful, polite and welcoming! The room was a good size and was perfect for what we needed. The location of the hotel is excellent, so easy to walk into the centre. The bed wasn‚Äôt overly comfortable."
1030,Joana,2021-06-01,"Best location to coordinate w/ trains (Temple Meads) and not far from the lively Castel Park area. Location to Temple Meads Station and Castle Park/canal. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful at all times. Bar has heated terrace and great outside space to accommodate people in the covid-times. Wine cart is good too. Some noise of the cleaners very early in the morning just outside my room, replenishing of amenities only happened when I asked at reception and quality of TP was below hotel standards."
1031,Samantha,2021-05-31,Weekend Break Fantastic location and very friendly staff. Will definitely be visiting again. Nothing
1032,Heidi,2021-05-31,Superb! Great location. Spotlessly clean. Friendly helpful polite staff. Loved it. Nothing
1033,Maria,2021-05-30,Great Staff were amazing. The bed was hard and very creaky.
1034,Violah,2021-05-30,It was ok Bed was too hard Location is ok though we initially could not find the entrance for the car park due to closed and not sign posted from the main road Breakfast was alright Soft mattress
1035,Joe,2021-05-29,Superb Staff friendly Are sure if cleaning rooms is viable but there 5 days no cleaning
1036,Gem,2021-05-26,Weekend at the garden. Clean room. Parking onsite even though this was a little expensive. Reception very busy on arrival and very difficult to hear. Could have got a hotel closer to the city for the same amount. Bed was very noisy.
1037,Andy,2021-05-25,"Superb The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was large and comfortable. The location was great. Nothing, everything was good."
1038,Patricia,2021-05-24,Very good Close to the centre. Parking charges.Limited parking spaces.
1039,Izabela,2021-05-23,"Ideal for a bit of fun, friendly staff and nice food Free welcome prosecco ‚ù§Ô∏è the staff were very helpful, we could take the food inside the room so loved the Sunday breakfast in bed üõèÔ∏èüç≥ The information about bar opening times (24h everyday for residents) was wrong and very disappointing"
1040,Joseph,2021-05-23,"It was pleasant, and I‚Äôll happily stay there again. Bed was comfy and facilities were good. Nice to have an iron and ironing board (some hotels don‚Äôt have them now). My door handle was broken on the Saturday night, luckily it didn‚Äôt derail my plans but it was a bit of a pain."
1041,Eleanor,2021-05-22,Comfortable room with friendly welcoming staff. Excellent choice of food for breakfast. Very convenient location - short walk from Temple Meads station. I would rate the dinner in the restaurant lower than the breakfast.
1042,Aidan,2021-05-22,"A clean, modern and friendly city centre hotel, good value for money for a business traveller. Very friendly welcome at reception. Room was spacious and comfortable. Bed was comfy and I slept very well. Large TV on the wall. Good free wifi. Nice bathroom with a good shower. Nice freshly cooked breakfast. All very Covid safe but relaxed. Nothing really, it was spot on for a business traveller."
1043,John,2021-05-14,Great Hotel Helpful and friendly staff & great breakfast....
1044,Caterina,2021-05-04,Very good Lovely room with park view Everything was ok
1045,Malika,2024-04-30,"I have stayed in this hotel several times, but will probably not return. The location is excellent, but the car park is limited and expensive. There should be reference to a cheaper car park on the other side of the hotel. The breakfast was excellent, but otherwise the food menu is limited, portions are smaller than before and quite expensive. Last orders in the restaurant and for room service is at 9.30 pm and food service closes at 10 pm. For early departures, there are no breakfast options. The restaurant gets over-crowded and busy with groups travelling. Other customers at the hotel must sit and eat in the small bar section with a wide screen mostly on sports (soccer) channels. I had booked a room with king-size bed, fridge, laptop safe and balcony. There are no rooms with balcony and also got a room on the noisy street side, not park side. There was a small safe, but no laptop safe and no fridge. The room cost also included bathrobe and slippers that were not in the room and were not provided by the hotel. The management blamed Booking com and agreed to refund only ¬£20 per night. No refund for not having breakfast upon early departure. The manager of the reception, Peter was rather rude and inattentive. This has happened before, too, when my restaurant meals were charged to my room although I paid for the in the restaurant. That led to a long exchange with the hotel to sort out the overcharges.."
1046,Baldwin,2024-04-29,Great time Staff were brilliant. We arrived early and were checked in to the room. All were friendly and accommodating
1047,Fiona,2024-04-28,"Excellent sleep Staff were lovely, the bed was exceptionally comfy. Great location handy for the train station."

1054,David,2024-04-20,Exceptional Felt classier than a premier inn Bar not cosy.
1055,Nataliia,2024-04-18,"Super enjoyable My stay at the Hilton hotel was great with fancy stuff and nice people. The staff were really kind and helpful, and they made my stay super enjoyable. I think you should stay at the Hilton hotel if you want a cozy and friendly experience. Nothing"
1056,Kelly,2024-04-14,Great stay would stay again Ideal location for what we visited for! Clean rooms! Staff lovely! Breakfast could be improved
1057,Paine,2024-04-14,"good location. Poor facilities I slept well. The room and shower were comfortable The internet didn't work when I arrived there. I was told to ring reception on 0, when I checked in, if I had any problems. I rang reception 3 times and no one picked up the phone. I held on at least 2 mins each time."
1058,Patrycja,2024-04-09,"Could be better, needs some refresh Delicious with sweet and sour varieties Bed could be more comfortable, carpet was with staines"

1060,Mark,2024-04-06,"Very poor The staff are excellent and tried their best to help. Excellent breakfast and comfortable evening bar. Probably the most uncomfortable bed I've ever tried to sleep in, even after a mattress topper was added I still struggled to get a good night's sleep. Way too hard for me!"
1061,Lisa,2024-04-03,"Would not come back. Staff fabulous. Room really small, hot and not usual standard I have experienced from Hilton. Terrible nights sleep."
1062,Sarah,2024-04-03,"Mediocre, did not live up the price. Fair size car park with spaces. Loved the fact it had fridge in the room. Great you provide free nice smelling toiletries. Rooms smaller than similar chain hotels. Rooms seemed dated, zero view out the window, bed was too small. Lacked plugs on both sides of bed for phone/ watch charging. Bathroom as very compact. Sadly breakfast was not as nice to taste or as nice of an experience as other chain hotels. Nit as central in the city as thought. Car park fee was extortionate!"
1063,Rachel,2024-04-02,would stay again nice room and breakfast
1064,Stephen,2024-04-01,Pleasant Convenient location Staff were very nice Hotel was fairly clean Bed was rock hard Pillows were terrible Room was dinky for a queen

1067,Madhubanti,2024-03-27,"May return The staff is very friendly, the Bristol station. The hotel is close to Saint Nicholas market, And a short taxi ride away from Glochester shopping area. Are you the only thing I would give feedback on is that the breakfast didn‚Äôt have bread - it ran out by the time I got to it."
1068,Vanessa,2024-03-27,Great place to stay Great welcome

1070,Louise,2024-03-25,"Exceptional We were only staying one night but this hotel was so nice. The staff were friendly, and the room was so nice. Nothing to complain about. Being disabled, we were able to park right outside, and the staff had placed us in a lovely room on the ground floor which was accessible for disabled persons. We didn't use any other facilities other than the room so cannot comment on the restaurant etc, but from what we could see it looked lovely."
1071,Derek,2024-03-24,"Bar closes far too early and food was expensive and poor Room was ok Breakfast wasn‚Äôt great Error on bill causing fraud alert, staff couldn‚Äôt explain but when checked out staff explained it was an error. I paid for parking and staff put a note in system to say we would be there for 5 nights but I since been issued a ¬£100 fine for one of the nights. Very poor organization"
1072,Robin,2024-03-22,"OK but pricey for what was provided. The receptionists were exceptionally helpful and considerate. One of them helped us find our destination within Bristol. Another provided a walking stick when I was limping and arranged for my wife to have fresh milk. The room was small and with very little space to hang clothes. Also, the bedside lights did not work."
1073,Mary,2024-03-21,"Perfect location, friendly staff - would stay here again. Perfect location, near the train. The staff were all friendly and knowledgeable, helpful. Room was very clean. Very nice desk chair and desk. Only one of the self serve coffee machines was working at breakfast. I'm okay with self serve coffee but it's annoying to make people wait in line to make their own coffee. The coffee & tea supplies in the room were not replenished for my second morning. This was disappointing. The bed was a tad hard but okay. The shower room is looking dated."
1074,Dodden,2024-03-18,"Very poor Location was good . Bar closed early ,no minibar in the room .carpets where filthy. Furniture was old and full of scratches and holes. Fornthebprice, it was shocking we couldn't turn the heating down. So it was so so hot."
1075,Anita,2024-03-18,As expected Room was good and majority of staff were helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was sufficient and good value if included in the price at time of booking. The location is excellent especially if exploring further destination by train. There was an issue with the prepaid breakfasts paid via booking.com however did not show on the booking The Hilton had. We were charged again and double for parking - all got sorted out eventually but it took several trips to the reception desk and one member was abrupt - event though the issue was with them.
1076,Patrick,2024-03-14,I enjoyed my visit. Everything was fine.
1077,Tracy,2024-03-10,"Adequate. Easy check in, parking, nice staff. Small room, small double bed. No water in room , only left out one towel in bathroom. Very adequate but not good value for Money."
1078,Jennie,2024-03-09,Lovely hotel and staff Clean and tidy Well maintained Breakfast was amazing Parking was a nightmare
1079,Stanwah,2024-03-07,Good hotel let down by some minor points Good clean hotel with friendly staff. Location okay not fantastic as there wasnt a great deal in the local area Bed was on wheels so was somewhat noisey Room was cold as air conditioning constantly blew out cold air despite trying to increase the temperature Pillows didnt hold their shape and where somewhat uncomfortable to sleep on
1080,Roger,2024-03-06,Bad housekeeping Perfectly ok hotel. Well located. Pleasant staff. . BUT woke up to find dried bloodstained linen on bed ( bottom pillow and edge of duvet) which had either not been changed and hidden or laundered bloodstained linen has been used. Either way NOT acceptable. Reception staff very apologetic but housekeeping outsourced. Pursuing complaint through booking.com as they can't issue compensation directly which they would have done with a direct booking.
1081,Hebden,2024-03-04,"Could be better. Staff were helpful and pleasant. Nice restaurant. Very hard bed. Basic, bland room. Toilet didn't flush fully. Noisy young guests next door causing problems until 3.30am until I confronted them. :("
1082,Melanie,2024-03-03,"Exceptional The reception staff are consistently excellent. Helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the area. I‚Äôve stayed many times and am always impressed."
1083,Ian,2024-03-02,Passable Was allocated a disabled room A disabled room
1084,Samuel,2024-02-24,Okay but not worth the money Welcoming staff in the restaurant and at front desk The room had not been cleaned properly on arrival (empty bottles) and I had the worst pizza I have ever seen or eaten from this Hotel
1085,William,2024-02-22,Exceptional Close to railway station comfortable great breakfast Nothing to dislike
1086,Richard,2024-02-22,Would not stay again. Reception staff polite and efficient. Good location. Well presented. Difficult to access with very limited car parking. Bed uncomfortable as base not solid. Dreadfull shower as temperature fluctuated from freezing cold to dangerously hot without mixer being touched.
1087,Laura,2024-02-21,"Overpriced and disappointing The location was central and close to attractions. Easy to reach from the coach and railway stations. Breakfast options were good, as were the timings (until 11am at the weekend, which gives you the chance of a lovely lie-in without missing it!) My room felt dark and cramped - sitting on the loo, the toilet roll holder was poking my arm, and I am of average size! There were stains on the carpets and the TV remote control only worked some of the time. No instructions were given on check-in about breakfast (which was included in my room rate), and when I went down in the morning there were no staff at the breakfast buffet and I had to go and ask at reception, where they weren't particularly polite. Overall, not of the standard I was expecting for ¬£100+ per night."
1088,Andrea,2024-02-20,"Overrated: the fourth star is there for the Hilton name, not the quality of service  The absolutely filthy state of the Herman Miller chair in the room left me disgusted. The cleaner barged into the room without knocking around 9am."
1089,Claire,2024-02-18,"Run down hotel, that‚Äôs need renovation! The reception staff seemed friendly - the bar and restaurant staff kept asking us to leave feedback with their names so they could get a bonus! The room smelt like sewerage, the drainage is clearly an issue. The air con in the room didn‚Äôt work, the sink was cracked and the room was run down‚Ä¶ 2 wines cost me ¬£25‚Ä¶"
1090,Mckayla,2024-02-18,"If you order vegan, it won't be vegan. The room was pretty modern and I was on the ground floor. Staff upon check in were friendly. No tissues behind toilet. No conditioner in shower. Menu states Vegan food supplied but the nightime staff told me that isn't true and they just give everyone non vegan food and don't say anything (I was enquiry about the VE 24hour pizza. This is absolutely disgusting. I have a dairy allergy, I could have died. Sausages and mushrooms at breakfast were undercooked. Absolutely not work the ¬£180 (plus breakfast)."
1091,Isabelle,2024-02-18,Not worth the dreadful trek through one way streets and imperfect diversions. Clean I location Lack of snacks etc Small bathroom
1092,Manonamission,2024-02-18,"Corporate room, with onsite parking, and regrettably dreadful breakfast. Good location within a 5-10 min walk of shopping, cultural places, harbourside, and a foodie quarter. Having its own car parking is a huge bonus in busy thriving cities such as Bristol. Sound proofing of the room from the traffic was excellent. In the room, was an empty and working fridge which meant we could chill wine, some proper milk(!), and some fresh nibbles. There was also a safe which was appreciated. Staff were all very pleasant and accommodating. The room was quite 'corporate' and devoid of character. And it felt quite cramped. Coffee/Tea provisions were miserly. Only one towel was in the bathroom though luckily we found another in the wardrobe. Initially we were allocated a twin room despite having booked a king bed, which meant having to traipse back down to reception to have it resolved - which it was. Car parking is quite pricey and feels it's exploiting the fact it is onsite -I guess cheaper alternatives are a short walk away. Biggest disappointment was the cooked breakfast buffet in the morning - undercooked tomatoes (how the?), leathery bacon, anaemic(!) tasteless sausages, rubbery(!) scrambled eggs. It was truly dreadful. I wished I'd chosen continental. (Note - we did find out that you can order eggs any way you want but would have been helpful to know when we entered)."
1093,Alice,2024-02-17,"Comfortable and convenient - set me up for the days work ahead Excellent location for my work in Bristol - comfortable and convenient, good shower and clean bathroom. Breakfast was lovely with good selection. Really appreciated being able to leave my bag after checking out, and to pick it up after my day's work. The chair for the desk in my room seemed to some water stains on the seat which made it feel a bit shabby compared to the high standard elsewhere."
1094,Klaudia,2024-02-16,Very friendly and helpful staff Location and great service Nothing
1095,Hannah,2024-02-15,"Service absolutely amazing but not the best room The staff were absolutely amazing from start to finish, literally couldn‚Äôt fault them despite the hotel being busy. The breakfast was great. To be honest the actual room and bathroom looked a bit tired and dated. For the price I don‚Äôt feel it met Hilton‚Äôs usual high standard. This was a valentines night away with my partner and I was a bit embarrassed at how underwhelmed he was on entering the room."
1096,Ruth,2024-02-14,Exceptional Very comfortable beds and super helpful staff Overpriced biscuits and water
1097,Dakota,2024-02-12,"Great location but poor hotel Location is great here, bus stop directly outside the entrance of hotel, trains station and city centre a few minutes walk. Breakfast had a good selection of food and drinks and was overall quite tasty. Our first room, had a whole in the ceiling and side of arm chairs had been ripped off as well as our aircon not working at all. Our 2nd room - aircon would work by blowing out air however temp control stated ‚Äòfailure‚Äô and wold not heat up so we were cold all night. The beds are only a double and ridiculously uncomfortable. The mattress if not firm but rock solid. The pillows although they look fluffy squash down to virtually flat. Very basic and minimalistic room. For the name, I expected more for my money."
1098,Elizabeth,2024-02-10,"Ideal location for the theatre Excellent location for the train station and the Hippodrome theatre. Nice room,comfy bed and a good breakfast. Staff friendly and helpful."
1099,Elizabeth,2024-02-06,Accommodation was not what I expected from Hilton Good location. Friendly helpful staff Wash basin in room was cracked. Handle for toilet flush was coming away from the wall.
1100,Angela,2024-02-05,Good stay in Bristol Good breakfast and evening nibbles in Recess restaurant. Friendly staff. Not a lot of space in the room.
1101,Jeff,2024-02-05,"Passable Breakfast was excellent Room was very small, not as clean as I would have expected, carpet and curtains dirty. Bed very noisy and therefore uncomfortable as the wooden base creaked every time you moved."
1102,Shannon,2024-02-04,Not worth the money Close to the Center Small bathroom that was damaged in several places. The surrounding area to the hotel was a building site.
1103,John,2024-02-04,"Pleasant  Shower was not working properly, the temperature control was not working properly, either to hot or to cold, could not get the right temperature because it was faulty. Only one big towel and 2 small towels in bathroom, 2 big towels were needed."
1104,Stephen,2024-01-29,Great Location for a weekend in Bristol Fantastic location. Clean comfortable rooms with good shower. Comfortable bed and room was sound proofed. Nothing
1105,David,2024-01-27,"Poor, Breakfast OK. Room extremely cold. Was offered a different room or a radiator. Rather than change room chose the latter bur was then supplied with a fan heater that was a noisy and crude way of heating that could not be left on for long periods."
1106,David,2024-01-14,"Good location, but hotel room only just adequate and in need of refurbishment. Good location, easy access from railway station and easy walk into city centre, friendly reception and restaurant staff. Room was tired, carpet stained, missing paint on skirting board in bedroom. Whilst room was reasonably sized, there was very little space between the bed and the wall on one side yet other side of bed was a large open space."
1107,Amir,2024-01-14,"Tired rooms and bit average. Great location, handy for the station and town. Very basic, tired looking rooms. Main light in the room didn‚Äôt work, was only one towel in the bathroom, and a very stained chair in the room. Parking was also ¬£20 where advertised as ¬£16."
1108,James,2024-01-14,"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend  Overpriced for what it is, room wasn‚Äôt very clean"
1109,Alison,2024-01-13,Fine but nothing special Clean Friendly Staff Rooms were very small and basic. No biscuits on the tea tray was disappointingly stingy. Shower seal was coming off
1110,Suzanne,2024-01-12,Excellent hotel. Wouldn‚Äôt stay again because of parking Good position for town centre. Clean rooms. Good breakfast Parking! Had to pay ¬£10 in nearby car park as the 20 odd spaces in hotel were full of builders working nearby. So had to wait until they finished before parking for ¬£20 overnight in hotel car park. The receptionist told me they let them park as they make money from them! Surely customers come first!
1111,Anwen,2024-01-07,"You get what you pay for Location Room wasn't as clean as I'd like, but worn and dated. Apple juice at breakfast was fermented and mouldy"

1115,Kelly,2024-01-02,"It was a nice hotel but not worth the price. Clean room and easy location to where we needed to be. The breakfast was nice in the morning and the front desk staff were helpful as our dinner booking was cancelled by the hotel. The room was very small for a queen room and the price. Parking I would expect to be better for the ¬£20 you have to pay it‚Äôs just Right by a main road with no security? We had a squeaky bed and a fousty smell wafting through the room which we think was from the air vents. The room was tiny and nothing amazing in there besides a fridge so I‚Äôm unsure what the extra value of the queen room was for. The staff in the bar in the evening barely spoke the atmosphere was dyer! No music considering it was NYE, we felt like they didn‚Äôt want us there."
1116,Katryna,2023-12-30,Disappointing I was really disappointed with the room as it was looking out onto a building site
1117,Stephen,2023-12-28,"Chritmas and Boxing Day City Break. Friendliness and helpfulness of staff. Heating in room did not work however given portable heater in the room which was adequate. TV selection was poor and channel selection software didn't appear to work , very few channels to select which was dissapointing. Bed mattresses also hard which was uncomfortable."
1118,John,2023-12-28,Excellent As above Finding the Hotel
1119,Tracy,2023-12-26,"Was perfect, definitely will stay again. Lovely staff, comfy bed, spotlessly clean and delicious breakfast. Nothing"
1120,Amy,2023-12-21,"Passable Great location, ideally located near the train station and 10/15 minute walk into the center. Rooms decent size and clean. Good selection at breakfast. The hotel has not dealt with my complaint in relation to noise during my stay. We were told a week prior to our stay the restaurant would be closed to a private function. Not an issue as planned to eat in the city but the hotel placed us on floors one and three with no consideration of the noise we would experience from the function until gone midnight both nights. It's a shame as the hotel was perfect for location and somewhere I would like to stay again had they acknowledged our concerns better. It was clean and the bed were comfy, my only concern was the noise from the functions. However I'm reluctant to return due to the poor customer service from the reception staff and management. The hotel had five floors.I think they could have considered putting us higher up to avoid the noise and away from.guests staying for the function as we had a lot of slammed doors and shouting until gone midnight both nights. Also they could have reminders around hotel for guests to be respectful to other guests staying at the hotel. The room also had poor lighting and were quite dark in the bedroom area."
1121,Catherine,2023-12-19,"I will never come back It was close to the train station I was put in a room on the first floor near the front of the hotel and I could hear people chatting while smoking in front of the hotel like they were in my room. The hotel was very noisy. I was then sent to a room on the 5th floor with a leak in the shower and the heater was broken. The heaters in both rooms were very very noisy, the noise was worse than if a car was in the room and in the new room it did not even work. I had to go to the front desk and they gave me a space heater. No heater in the middle of winter is unacceptable for a room at 200 euros a night. Moreover the remote for the TV did not work. Unfortunately, I cannot add the video here to show what it was like. The pictures on booking and the reality in the hotel are very different. The furniture are old and the carpet is very old."
1122,Christakis,2023-12-17,"Exceptional Staff (Maria checked us in) were extremely, professional, courteous and accommodating. 10/10"
1123,Ian,2023-12-11,"Passable  Disappointed that there was no bar or restaurant for either of the nights of our stay due to private functions. Even though we were told about this after we had booked, this is not an acceptable level of service for what we paid."
1124,Ruth,2023-12-10,Awful  To be told at 9.30am 15 minutes after arriving no bar or restaurant available in the evening was appalling as we like to use the hotel facilities in the evening nor was this highlighted when booking this hotel when we come away we don‚Äôt want to sit in a cold lobby I will Not book this hotel again as I took this up with reception and they couldn‚Äôt care less. And god forbid that I wanted to pay cash for my drink on 2 occasions to be told no it‚Äôs card the staff would only take my cash when I explained to them that I didn‚Äôt have a card!
1125,Jamie,2023-12-08,Pleasant Good location Rainhead shower needed and not hot enough. King bed was just two twin beds pushed together and tv not working.
1126,Deborah,2023-12-06,So bad that I cancelled a booking for next year. The reception staff were good. Bathroom ok but no stock of loo paper and not replaced until requested. No towels replaced in room. Dirty stained chair. Had to bring my own hangers as not enough for 2 people. Lack of choice of meals on first night due to coach party having buffet. Ended up with a starter. Parking expensive. Drinks in bar restuarant expensive. Setting not very good either. Felt more like a premier inn or travel lodge.
1127,Sarah,2023-12-06,Wish I had never stayed there Breakfast was good TV was not working properly Carparking was ¬£20 for 24hrs not mentioned anywhere could not buy for 12 A simple order for dinner wrong poor quality Carpet had stains on it Water kept going cold in shower poor pressure Fire Alarm went off at 6.55 for just long enough to wake us up and not able to go back to sleep sign downstairs said fire alarm was the following morning at 11am
1128,Woodward,2023-12-06,"The hotel was fine but we have been to Bristol on quite a few occasions and have stayed in better . The breakfast was very nice, but the location was a little far out for us. Allow no one used the shower. It was leaking and by the morning the bathroom floor was wet. Maybe an accident waiting to happen."
1129,Adam,2023-12-06,Exceptional Staff are excellent.
1130,Sean,2023-12-06,Pleasant location next to train station staffing levels were poor with breakfast area looking shabby due to staff not able to keep up with cleaning due to amount of people eating. for a hilton hotel it felt tired inside.
1131,Joshi,2023-12-05,Disappointing The rooms are tired. The AC makes too much noise and the AC instructions sticker does not match the actual controls. Small room.. Not worth ¬£150 that I paid for a night stay. Excellent staff and breakfast. Comfy bed.
1132,Jack,2023-12-05,"Poor  Couldn't control the heating in the room (you were supposed to be able to, but it wasn't working in mine), creakiest bed I've ever slept in, had a 'do not disturb' sign on the door that was ignored by housekeeping."

1136,Mrs,2023-12-03,"Pleasant Some of the staff were professional, but I feel they would benefit from better training, to make the customers feel welcome on they stay. We thought this property was not good value for money. There was only one comfortable seat to relax in in the bar, and that was just inside the door where everyone was going in and out for a smoke. The rooms had no sofa or comfortable chair so all together you couldn't sit and enjoy a drink anywhere. The hair dryer in our room was melted, so I thought unsafe to use. There was no heating in the rooms and no extra blankets, so I was awake most of the night, shivering.."

Staff were not really helpful we arrived very late 11:00 pm and the hotel restaurant was closed, we asked if they could recommend anything they were not helpful. Also I had asked for a quiet and spacious room, they responded by email saying they would facilitate my request however on arrival we were given a horrible room facing the construction site, and first thing in the morning there was a lot of noise, we barely had a decent sleep. We had asked for a late check out and we were told we can only stay extra 30 mins even though the hotel wasn't busy.I was disappointed for the money i paid"

1157,Cath,2023-11-03,"Hot and stuffy room and unprofessional male receptionist let down an otherwise nice hotel. Clean room, good shower, comfy beds The room was so stuffy and sweltering despite it being cool outside in October and the window only opened a tiny amount. The air conditioning was useless and very noisy - we came home a night early as both were recovering from colds so we were already blocked up. The worse part overall was the reaction of the male grey haired receptionist with glasses. On the morning of our second day we decided to go home early so I went to reception only to hand in the room cards and check out. I wasn't expecting any refund and didn't really want to explain anything and we were so tired we just wanted to get home. After making me wait for a few minutes until he served me (unapologetically) while he did some admin from the previous guest, I pleasantly said I just wanted to check out and handed him the cards. He looked at his screen and said ""but you're staying for 2 nights"" - I explained that we weren't feeling good and that the room had been unbearable hot and stuffy so we had had a bad night and just wanted to go home. he replies ""Well, you'll have to pay for the second night"" without making eye contact staring at his computer. I'd already paid for the stay when I checked in and hadn't even mentioned not paying for the second night. I was so taken aback and foggy headed that I just said ""I've already paid"" and he handed me the card of the manager in case we wanted a refund. I was amazed at his response and in hindsight I wish I had been more on the ball. Rather than saying something like, ""Im sorry to hear that"" / ""maybe we can move you to a cooler room or ""did you try the air conditioning? I came away feeling as if we were treated like we were not worthy to be staying there and were trying something on, not like a valued guest at all. This member of staff needs some customer service refresher training, or perhaps a new job where he isn't dealing with customers."
1158,Navy,2023-11-02,"Good VFM room in convenient location Good location beside the train station. Professional staff. The carpets, curtains and upholstery were all a little ""tired"". I'm sure a deep clean would fix it. Hard to do when you're kept busy!"
1159,Carl,2023-10-30,"Great location for train & city centre Breakfast, location, gym, facilities, staff All good except shower control of hot water.

1160,Nigel,2023-10-30,"Good location but pricey Good location, helpful friendly staff. Rooms were clean. The toiletries supplies were good quality and smelled great. Beds were very comfy. Air con wasn't working in both our rooms. There was building work right opposite and they were very noisy from 7am on a Sunday morning. We weren't told about this in advance. Shower was leaking.

The staff were friendly and helpful The room and corridors looked tired and shabby. Our room was very small with the bathroom like a caravan size bathroom. The curtains and carpets had stains. No bottled water in the room which we feel should be standard when you are paying the rate we did

1173,Andrew,2023-10-10,Overpriced and unsatisfactory best thing about the stay was leaving after checkout. Breakfast! The hotel was surrounded by road closures and a building site. Open the room curtain and builders could look in. Access to the car park was limited due to road closures. The hotel should have arranged temporary direction signage‚Äôs.

1177,Valerie,2023-10-10,"Exceptional Within walking distance of train station but also very close to the city centre, restaurants and bars. The hotel was very comfortable. I could read the labels on the toiletries in the shower without my glasses plus the shower head actually sprayed in the right direction. The breakfast catered for all tastes. Nothing"
1178,Grzegorz,2023-10-09,"Exceptional Hilton Garden Inn in Bristol is a fantastic price-quality-location combination. Very friendly staff, great breakfasts, clean rooms, close to the railway station and airport bus, fitness, beautiful park just opposite to the hotel... I will come back there for sure. The restaurant and room service could operate longer. Last order at 9:30pm is a little bit too early as for me."
1179,Shirley,2023-10-09,"Great hotel. Had a fantastic time there All staff was very friendly, helpful. Food was excellent. Room was clean and great size. Could not fault anything in the hotel.

1184,Richard,2023-10-02,Expensive for very basic facilities The location was good for us For a Hilton it was very basic. A bottle of water in the room would be a good thing for them to do.

1194,Terry,2023-09-20,Exceptional Everything . Nothing
1195,Jane,2023-09-19,"Good location for train station, lovely staff. Very nice, helpful staff. Comfortable room. Quite hard to find way into hotel car park as lots of building work in the area and not well signposted."
1196,Sarah,2023-09-18,"HOT but not in a good way! Was able to leave bags at reception as we arrived before check-in. Staff courteous and helpful. Air conditioning not working in both rooms on one of the hottest days of year, offered us a fan & cold drinks. Had to move hotels as the heat was so unbearable, picked this hotel because of the Hilton name so really disappointed with the standard of room."
1197,Michael,2023-09-17,"Pleasant Location brilliant, food and bar superb, clean hotel, friendly, helpful staff. Outdated, well used room, no USB charger socket."
1198,Isabelle,2023-09-16,"Passable Friendly staff 1)Being charged ¬£20 for parking. The initial email received a few minutes after booking said ¬£16, I contacted the hotel to ask about blue badge parking because my friend has mobility issues. Was told they have 3 but it is on a first come first served basis. (and incidently, those three spaces are quite far from the entrance/reception area - far from ideal. ) 2) Difficult to find. The hotel is easy to see from Temple Way, but finding the entrance to the car park/hotel entrance was difficult. It is poorly signposted and a bit of a nightmare. 3) The hotel accommodation is average. We booked a room with a king-size bed and there was very little room to move around the bed, the room felt very small. The room description mentions an ergodynamic chair, which was the only chair in the room and quite uncomfortable.. The furniture hasn't been updated for a while. Bed side sockets could be more accessible. Don't be deceived by the ""Hilton"" name, this feels like an inferior budget hotel, and what you save on the so called free breakfadt in the room description is taken off you in parking fees."
1199,Matthew,2023-09-15,"Very unsatisfactory - issues with rooms being over booked Not a lot Room size and ground floor position by restaurant toilets, poor air conditioning"
1200,Patricia,2023-09-11,Excellent stay with brilliant location to City and Train Station Staff went out of their way to be helpful especially with food intolerances Nothing to add

1202,Keeli,2023-09-10,"Ok for a night or so. Room very very clean. Staff helpful and happy. Air con amazing Breakfast - Very limited choice, not much space for the dining. Expensive for what is on offer. Evening - 45min wait for a toasted Sandwich, which was very poor quality and cold."
1203,Carol,2023-09-10,"If we travel to Bristol in the future this will definately be our hotel of choice. We liked everything about the hotel. The staff were excellent, couldn't be more friendly and helpful. The whole hotel was immaculate from the reception, dining room and our room. Nothing, you can't beat perfection!"
1204,Melanie,2023-09-06,"Great hotel, superb central location. Great location Car park awkward to get to due to building work and road closures. Would be handy to have updated directions whilst it‚Äôs ongoing."

1206,Simon,2023-09-01,"Ok for a 3 star hotel definitely not acceptable for Hilton Easy access Dated, poor Wi-Fi, not a great tv selection Cut hand on office chair in room that had seen better days. Sink cracked. Can not see TV from desk .."
1207,Debbie,2023-08-31,"Overpriced Disappointment Location was perfect for us. Room size was adequate and well equipped with fridge and safe. Room cleanliness left a lot to be desired. There were splashs of something all over the wall next to the mirror, the quilt cover on one bed was stained and the bathroom fixtures were in disrepair and had rusted to a degree. I expected a better breakfast selection given the star rating of this hotel, and the standard of the cooked items on offer was sub standard at best. I expected better quality for the room rate I paid and I wouldn't recommend the Hilton chain."
1208,Roberta,2023-08-31,Exceptional Very nice hotel. Excellent facilities and kind personnel. The breakfast was very good. I highly recommend it.
1209,Christine,2023-08-30,Comfortable and safe Friendly staff comfortable bed Great breakfast with lots of choices And on site parking Stains on the bedroom carpet
1210,Helen,2023-08-29,"Lovely staff, great choice of a buffet breakfast rooms could do with being a little more different. Central to all of the surrounding area, shops, bars . The rooms were pretty much the same, I firstly booked the queen room with park view, I was offered an upgrade which seemed good to a king room, when we arrived we were given our room to fines it was a twin double, the reception staff were lovely and changed us to the room I had upgraded to, to find we were overlooking the main road and the only difference I could see was the size of the bed, the t.v had no menu as to what was on which can be annoying."
1211,Jessica,2023-08-29,This is by no means a 4 star hotel Breakfast was por The room was filthy.. dinner was a pizza 15.00 which was absolutely awful. Very dated hotel fixtures were hanging off..
1212,Malgorzata,2023-08-29,"Worth it! Very much liked the fact of breakfast till 11. That is a great thing, especially when you stay up late the other night discovering the city. Clean room and always helpful staff Nothing I didn't like. Just missed vegetables like tomato or cucumber at breakfast. But that wouldn't lower my opinion about this hotel."
1213,Gerard,2023-08-29,Overall a good experience The location and cleanliness Thought the bar was over priced and the car park
1214,Dawn,2023-08-29,Exceptional Staff friendly helpful room really good. Clean tidy I think that the catering team could provide at least 2 vegetables for breakfast so mushrooms and tomatoes not one or the other. Also a list of things on offer so poached eggs vegan sausages etc we had to ask. Prunes would be a welcomed addition to the fresh fruit range. Double checking room to make sure that the room service menu is actually in there.Ours was not.A map of Bristol in the room or on offer at reception would be great as well. And where was the Gideon bible ?????
1215,Richard,2023-08-28,"Great value for money, convenient for public transport and exceeded my expectations in every way. I was pleasantly surprised with everything about the hotel. i chose it based on price and location, which was perfect as was using public transport for a week of visiting family and friends. I have travelled a fair bit during the past year and hotel prices have been ludicrously high in most places. Everything, the staff, the comfortable bed, soundproofing from outside noise, breakfast, etc,etc. made my stay really enjoyable at a reasonable price. I was staying alone so maybe the room I had may be small for 2 people, but I would still recommend booking here. No criticism."
1216,Zena,2023-08-28,In need of a revamp Central location within walking distance of Bristol Temple Meads railway station. Tiered and dated d√©cor that need a comprehensive refresh.

I had a starter and a main my partner only had main. We had 1 drink each and water.. we went to pay and order two beers to take to our room and the bill came to over ¬£70+ which was a shock but we paid it as we didn't want to cause a fuss but that was a lot for what we ordered.

Told hotel, not heard anything back from them apart from acknowledging my complaint. Room 236 ‚Ä¶.avoid!!!! Thank you for responding, but I do not believe no bed bugs were found. How come I was fine when I came into the hotel room and then had over 30 bites on my arms, legs and back from the side that i slept on when I left the next day?"
1231,Steven,2023-08-17,Poor no thank you Bristol Hilton The room was comfortable Aircon did not work 1. Parking not told until booking made that parking was ¬£20 a day! I tried to cancel as we had travelled in 2 cars ¬£40 as a guest on room that cost ¬£82. 2. Roadworks were everywhere at the Hotel no message to inform us that all entrances were closed around hotel. Easy to warn customers in advance! 3. At breakfast my partner was rudely approached that we didn‚Äôt have breakfast on our booking which was totally incorrect! So I was made to back to room to bring my phone and show proof of the breakfast! Staff should know!! Aircon I‚Äôm room was not working at all and when approached next day the staff said we could have got a fan at night. Ut that‚Äôs not cool air that‚Äôs just blowing warm air around. Overall poor

Very comfortable room with plenty of space and clean. Very nice restaurant and bar, foods were really good. Breakfast was plentiful and the good thing is that breakfast was laid out in different part ie. main breakfast in one corner, pastries drinks & coffee in other area so it avoided crowding in one place everyone queuing in most of the other hotels. Couple bottles of mineral water in room would have been nice."

1246,Jane,2023-08-03,"Great hotel for the price Staff were friendly. Hotel was smart and clean (and reception area smelt nice). Small room and double bed were comfortable. Limited parking, so best to have a Plan B in case car park is full. Overall, a great hotel for the price."

The breakfast was very nice, the staff all very friendly and polite. very handy for the city centre. i liked the provision of a fridge empty toiletry bottles, broken pump on toiletry bottle, Showerhead was full of limescale. Quite a small room and even smaller bathroom this considering i was 'upgraded' to a King room, too small, and once the luggage bags where in, no room to pass the bed. When i booked i was offered a city view, i actually received a main road and a large overgrown tree view it was very very noisy all throughout the night. The desk chair provided was heavily stained, no complimentary biscuits with the coffee and tea. and finally i thought the charge of ¬£20 to park my car, as a guest, on site was a little extortionate."

A hot day with a cool night, but very small windows. Unable to let any fresh air in. Air conditioning very noisy. No USB charging points in the room."
1289,Richard,2023-06-16,"If you are happy to stay in a room that resembles a hostel then stay here. Staff were friendly and walking distance to train station. -Rooms decor looks like its from the 70s - Dustiest room ive ever stayed in. Each morning i woke up my eyes were stinging, nose iching and lungs very irritated. I don't have allergies so it must have been heavy with dust. - Bed was very uncomfortable and it smelt musty and old. - Aircon wasn't cold. - Room was tiny - I had 2 terrible nights of very broken sleep. - Im surprised the Hilton would put their name on this hotel to be honest."
1290,Gordon,2023-06-15,I thought Hilton Garden Inn very comfortable and in a convenient location. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hygiene was of a very high standard. The food was very good. I cannot think of anything I did not like.
1291,Alice,2023-06-11,Comfortable and convenient - set me up for the days work ahead Very convenient for the work I was doing in Bristol and ofr zooming into meetings the night before. Friendly staff and comfortable bed.
1292,Jiadi,2023-06-06,"Disappointing Staff were kind. There was someone left their opened toothbrush with toothpaste on the shower door! I can't imagine how it would left there. I was too tired to ask for changing room and only stayed for a night, in all I don't recommend this place."
1293,Sebastian,2023-06-05,"Pleasant Staff were great, location was perfect and breakfast was decent The bathroom in my room wasn't very clean. The shower especially and around the sink. The walls and ceiling seemed to have mould or damp that wasn't very pleasant."
1294,Aisha,2023-06-05,"the staff are simply amazing!! The staff made our stay even more exceptional, special mentions to Bailey & Annie! super clean hotel with on-site parking from a trusted brand! well done üëçüèº all ok"
1295,Richard,2023-06-05,"Just what I needed for a one night stay. As to be expected for the Hilton standard, all was to my satisfaction. Nothing comes to mind that could be considered unsatisfactory."

1297,Pamela,2023-06-04,"It was fine/adequate but nothing to write home about. Not likely to book again. Location was nice and central Cleanliness in the room wasn‚Äôt great, the bed was noisy and not at all comfortable. Room too hot."
1298,Maxine,2023-06-03,"Room and restaurant service fine. Male Receptionist in wrong job!  We checked to see if there were electric charging points. When we got there the 3 points were occupied by non-electric cars which remained for our entire 20 hour stay. There is no system for checking number plates, so they couldn‚Äôt be contacted. When my husband politely complained, the (male) receptionist told him he was being aggressive!! We had huge difficulties in finding the hotel entrance as there are road works and no signage. The receptionist on duty when we arrived (Bailey) was very apologetic and upgraded our room."

1300,Susan,2023-06-01,"Wanted a stress free stay .went to see the Lion King.wonderful hotel ,Thankyou. FThe breakfast was superb the staff helpful. The evening staff almost fell over themselves to please us.and we had a lovely welcome on our arrival. I found the bed was a bit high so had to take a run and jump to get up there,much to the delight of my granddaughter.we loved our room. The hotel is quite a walk into shopping area,which would be ok if I didn‚Äôt have a painful back,not anything to do with the hotel of course, but if I came again I would choose somewhercloser to town. The tea in the room was organic , and not much milk etc.but the wonderful evening staff found me some English tea and supplied milk. But these were just niggles from someone my age."
1301,John,2023-05-31,great location & brings back memories about when we lived in Bristol very clean and the staff very friendly nothing
1302,Andrew,2023-05-30,Pleasant Comfy bed Loud aircon. No veggie sausages for breakfast.

1304,Konstantinia,2023-05-30,"Poor  Just got into the room and the shower was full of hair. Fortunately, they changed my room after I've requested it even if they wanted me to wait to clean it. Also, the sink was blocked in the new room creating a puddle of water when was using it."

1306,Bobbie,2023-05-29,"I wish I could have stayed longer, and I would most definitely stay here again. Comfortable, clean room, good facilities, great location, and everyone was so SUPER nice. Exceptionally nice. I can‚Äôt begin to describe how nice. Being American, I wished there was better coffee in the room, but the coffee downstairs in the restaurant was good, so this is a minor detail."
1307,Hakan,2023-05-29,Moderate Location is very central to train station and city center Bed and pillows were so soft that i couldn't sleep well. Also there needs to be at least free water bottle per day while accommodating.

1310,Rachel,2023-05-29,Good clean hotel. Clean and smart looking - staff were very nice Location was a bit out of town in an area which felt a bit like an office area but not far to walk to the main areas. Room was rather bland and small - felt very expensive for what it was. We were able to park at the hotel.
1311,Clara,2023-05-28,"good location but poor facilities, too expensive for what it is very close to the temple meads station carpet and furnitures were dirty. There was no toilet brush and no ventilation system in the bathroom. there was no do not disturb sign at our disposal to put in the door if need be and we couldn‚Äôt open the window."

1314,Safir,2023-05-23,"disappointing for Hilton branch great location Dissapointing stay for the value. The pictures doesn‚Äôt match the pictures. I received a room with stains on the wall, shower and carpet. The bed was not so comfy. The roomkey was getting demagnetisatized all the time. I had to reactivate it on a daily at least 3 times a day. no water available in the room except from tap water. I had to pay 4,56 euro for two bottles of 0,5cl water which is ridiculous."

1316,Jocelyn,2023-05-14,"Not great value for money- hotel was a bit tired and the room small. Staff, however were fantastic Great location, excellent and attentive staff, who really went the extra mile to accommodate us in our requests. Great, hot shower. Hotel decor and carpets are a little tired. Room was small and smelled of stale cigarette smoke. Toilet wouldn‚Äôt flush properly, the bed was uncomfortable."
1317,Harriette,2023-05-14,"Pretty poor Location was good Room overlooked a building site. Chewing gum on the side table Fridge didn‚Äôt work, thick dust on top of the fridge. Dirty glass. Thick line scale on chrome parts of shower"
1318,Ella,2023-05-13,"Great location, fab staff, very hard bed! Location was good, staff were friendly, restaurant/bar was decent. Breakfast was average but suitable. Bed was pretty uncomfortable, squeaked and cracked upon every movement and far too hard for me. Bathroom had long black hair all over the floor - minor but annoying. Air con kept turning off."

1320,Mike,2023-05-09,ok most things noise from traffic outside
1321,Ian,2023-05-08,Disappointing Location was good The rooms were quite small and basic. Shower and bathroom very small. Overpriced for what it provided
1322,Neil,2023-05-06,"as above. We are just a number not human beings location bland, no luxuries in the room, bed was hard. Just another beige place to stay, no character, no personal service, customers just a number. Classic case of post Brexit Post Covid cost cutting hotel."
1323,Mark,2023-05-05,Exceptional I like the facilities the people the location and the cleanliness of the building The parking situation. Apparently they have 175 rooms and about 50 parking spaces which if it's available you can pay $20 a day for parking.. however that does not guarantee you a parking spot when you come back to the parking lot.. I did get reimbursed for my charges on parking but it just was frustrating coming back at night and there's no parking spaces and then you got to go out at night trying to find one on the street somewhere where you don't get a ticket
1324,Rhiannon,2023-05-05,"Disappointing Very old Fashioned, bed was creaking, small shower"

1331,Madeline,2023-04-23,Passable The location is good - city centre so within walking distance to most of city. Foyer and bar are nice and staff were friendly. The rooms were very basic and there was a stain on one of the towels. Also ¬£20 per night for parking on-site is ridiculous.
1332,David,2023-04-23,"Exceptional Exelent hotel ,suited my needs perfectly"
1333,Leandro,2023-04-20,"Great Location, Amazing Staff Excellent location, walking distance from city main spots and Temple Meads Station. Staff was kind, friendly and paying attention to every single detail."
1334,Sarah,2023-04-18,not bad restaurant/bar staff shower door fitted incorrectly so couldn‚Äôt get in shower! had to shower with door wide open and water went everywhere
1335,Andrew,2023-04-18,"Building Site The reception staff were very welcoming on our arrival and gave great information on various sites in Bristol. Where do I start? I booked a room with a city view and despite 75% of the Hotel having this I was given a room facing a building site and awoke to find 3 builders directly opposite my window hammering scaffolding together! The mattress was too hars and the pilliwa had no support whatsoever leading to a night of very patchy sleep. Breakfast was barely lukewarm and the bacon was almost raw. So disappointing to have paid for something that was not delivered. Some kind of recompense is definitely in order, I would never use Hilton again!"
1336,Sarah,2023-04-16,"perfect .,Peter on reception was very helpful close to everything. great for a nights stay"
1337,Alice,2023-04-15,Comfortable and reliable Comfortable and convenient for the work I was doing in Bristol. I was well rested and ready to do a good job. Found the chair in the room difficult to keep at the right height for use of the desk area
1338,John,2023-04-15,excellent location nothing
1339,Ask,2023-04-13,Value for money - below standard. Location is great. Staff were fairly helpful especially Ms. Bailey. Male staff could do with a bit of CS retraining. The bed was awful. I could feel the springs. TV screen I believe is quite old ( remote is over used) and so pretty poor on brightness (remote worn out so cannot really adjust brightness). Why are there so much storage spaces - room feels very crammed. Carpets old - perhaps a thorough cleaning is in order. Sorry for the negative feedback. Remember this is Hilton! Expectations are high as the room rates are also high.
1340,Michael,2023-04-11,"Weekend show and stay Very clean smart and friendly hotel, excellent breakfast , 10 out of 10 Nothing"
1341,Matthew,2023-04-10,Fine for the brief time I was there Staff were friendly and welcoming Coffee on offer at breakfast was not pleasant. Also I booked a double and was changed to a twin
1342,Stephen,2023-04-09,Wish I'd stayed at the Premier Inn instead. Location was ok Comedy shower with inwards opening door so you can't get in and close it! Design probably necessitated by too small bathroom. Room seemed poorly prepared. Needed a good hoovering. Tea and coffee facilities not replenished and cups and spoons needed a wash. Bed very creaky and hard.
1343,Dudley,2023-04-08,very professional very comfortable. Breakfast was absolutely amazing and the shower was divine. shower was absolutely amazing and the bed was extremely comfortable I believe there wasn‚Äôt anything I dislike at this place
1344,Richard,2023-04-07,Pleasant  We were not advised that access to the hotel by car was a nightmare due to a combination of a need to find a way to the back of the hotel/car park and the extensive building works taking place in the area. Also a room in a 4 star hotel should provide a spare and more than two breakfast tea sachets - along with others.
1345,Amanda,2023-04-06,"Exceptional From the moment we walked in the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the reception staff, we stayed for 2 nights and our room was on floor 5, it was very clean, tea and coffee provided, a hairdryer, iron & ironing board, towels, shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, the beds were so comfy and the room was quite. We had breakfast, which you can have full breakfast, continental, fruit, waffles, tea coffee, juices. Hotel is close to shops pubs restaurants, about 15 minute walk through temple park (opposite hotel )then turn right up to Bristol Bridge, reception will give you a map and show you. We will definitely recommend and would stay again. For us there was nothing to dislike."
1346,Allen,2023-04-03,"Pleasant Friendly and professional staff especially Anna on reception Heating in room not working, having to change rooms late at night was not good when we were very tired"
1347,Kearney,2023-04-03,"Exceptional Near to the town centre ,very friendly staff, breakfast was lovely"
1348,Gemma,2023-04-01,"It was somewhere to put our head down but wouldn‚Äôt recommend or come back. Staff were pleasant and location was easy to find. The restaurant area was modern and looked well presented. The rooms were extremely plain, the cream carpets were stained and looked dirty. The bed was the worst thing of all. It was extremely uncomfortable, hard and noisy when moving in bed. The noise would wake me/partner up every time I tossed and turned. The parking cost was extremely expensive too."
1349,Jemma,2023-03-30,"Pleasant basic, good location, the bed was very noisy."
1350,Anne,2023-03-29,Great overnight stay to pick up a new car. A great hotel to stay with parking. Good service in the restaurant. Great shower and comfortable bed. Very easy check in. The weather!!!

1352,Luis,2023-03-27,Exceptional The staff is simply amazing.
1353,Ian,2023-03-27,"Pleasant friendly staff, breakfast felt like we were in a Travelodge which was shame for an upgraded room it felt like a standard room The breakfast wasn't what we expected especially for a Hilton hotel"
1354,Matthew,2023-03-27,"A far cry from what I expected from the 'Hilton' brand. I was compensated, with a free meal, for the various mistakes made by the hotel reception staff. When I arrived, I was told my booking did not include breakfast (which I had booked). Desiring breakfast, I was asked to pay there and then. Fine. But the card machine was broken. So I paid in cash and was told it would be taken off may bill when I checked out. When I ate in the restaurant that evening with my colleague, for which we asked to be billed separately, they billed us incorrectly - the billed my colleague for everything. So we had to pend 10 minutes sorting this out on checkout next morning. Also during checkout, I was told (by a different staff member) that I had overpaid for breakfast because my original booking did in fact include breakfast. Again this cost about 5 minutes of checkout time. In all, the reception experience was really dire. Nobody seemed to know what they were doing ir why mistakes had been made. As I said, this was helped by the removal of charge for my evening meal. However, my morning at the Hilton had already been tarnished by a rude breakfast chef. Still tired, I stood at the counter playing some hot items on my plate, when out of nowhere I was barred at by the chef for not putting the bacon tongs on a special resting plate in front of the tray. I had in fact picked up the tongs from where I;d left them, in the tray. I was taken aback by this rudeness - how are guests supposed to know this detail? the chef was doing nothing else than watch people do this over again. He could have replaced the tongs himself, or at least said 'good morning' first and perhaps 'sorry, sir, would you mind leaving the tongs on the plate in front"". When I made it clear that I was put out by his conduct, he started arguing with me, about how I should do what I was told. Really ridiculous. It raised stress levels that I really didn't need to be raised and is so easily avoidable. In short, the staff experience during my stay was pretty poor - either through basic incompetence or rudeness."
1355,Craig,2023-03-20,Great location and amazing staff location is excellent nothing
1356,Vicky,2023-03-20,A very nice and relaxing stay. The staff were great and showed care and professionalism when approaching my sisters condition (coeliac). I was made to feel comfortable and relaxed. The food was very good and was served in good time. The room was lovely and we didn't hear any outdoor noise. There was no information in the room about the time of breakfast or if food was available to order to the room.
1357,Liz,2023-03-19,"Very disappointed would not stay here again  Towels that were yellow and smelt stale and musty. Most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in , wooden frame creaked with every movement. Shower temperature could not be controlled"
1358,Serge,2023-03-17,"Passable  No hand soap at basin, only 2 sheets of kleenex, no bags for sanitary towels (though not reqd. male). Not noticed on arrival 'cos hidden by curtain, window open all night, hence cold, and air con trying to maintain temp ran all the time! Mentioned to reception."
1359,Iain,2023-03-13,"Good location, friendly staff, but the room had some basic problems. Great location near the train station, really friendly staff, easy check-in. No blankets or topsheet (in winter), the desk drawer was broken, and the shower door was a struggle to close. Nothing big, but it just felt a bit substandard."
1360,Daryl,2023-03-13,Disappointing Location was OK. Breakfast was great Room was small very tired Heating didn't work No tissues or bottled water
1361,Laura,2023-03-13,"Uncomfortable beds and too hot Good location with easy access to many attractions. There was less traffic noise than I was expecting. The man on the front desk was a bit snippy, if I'm honest. Yes we checked in 20 minutes early but he could have dropped the attitude. The rooms were far too hot and the bed was uncomfortable. The showerhead holder was held together with glue and wasn't secure, so kept falling on me. Overall, a very average hotel."
1362,Dave,2023-03-13,Disappointing Comfy bed Hot water Cleaners being loud talking Hoovers running in the hall ways from 9 am
1363,Sarah,2023-03-13,Not as good as we were expecting Breakfast was fantastic! The check in staff were really friendly and helpful The room was quite small and dated. Patches of mould in the bathroom. No hand wash

1365,Tim,2023-03-05,"Pleasant stay, good location, helpful staff. Staff were very helpful and polite when we discovered a problem with our original room - bad odour. Underlying mechanical noise in the room."
1366,Penny,2023-03-05,"Disappointing The breakfast was good quality and good value. The room was basic, the fridge wasn't switched on. We could not get it to work even though it was plugged in. There were no teaspoons to stir you coffer or tea.. it was chilly in the room and the warm air conditioning did not work. Apart from that the bed was comfy üòå"
1367,Bryce,2023-03-02,"Perfect hotel for a weekend city break Staff were very friendly and welcoming . Hotel was well managed , spotlessly clean and fresh . Substantial buffet breakfast included in my choice of booking. I think for some it would be to far out from the centre of Bristol for visitors who cannot walk great distances. On the plus side , close to transport links. Distance wasn‚Äôt a huge issue for me ."

1369,Nigel,2023-02-27,Absolutely fantastic Brilliant
1370,05awhitehouse,2023-02-23,I wouldn't stay again. Very disappointed The breakfast and their fragrance in the reception ¬£187 and the heater didn't work in the room. I was honestly shocked. A gas radiator had to be wheeled in. Beds were really uncomfortable too. I've had much better stays in a hostel. I'd recommend the ibis or holiday inn express nearby instead for the Cost difference.
1371,Lauren,2023-02-22,"Poor  uncomfortable HARD beds, cold room, heating sounded like an aeroplane taking off constantly so had to switch off. expensive stay for one night with poor facilities. very dated rooms."
1372,Donna,2023-02-21,it done the job but for a Hilton very poor the location was ok and wen u walked into the reception it smelt lovely the rooms was like a shoe box and wen the heating went on it was like a generator in the bedroom and for a Hilton it was very poor
1373,Sandra,2023-02-14,very enjoyable it was central located. very good position
1374,Lee,2023-02-14,"Stay Elsewhere Located in the centre of Bristol, which met my needs as i had a meeting nearby. First of all don't be taken in by booking.com offering a free upgrade, as all the rooms are exactly the same, and the bathrooms are tiny. The location of the hotel is decent, but trying to get access to it was a nightmare, with the one way system, roads closed and excessive building work nearby. The hotel itself was more like a Travelodge style, and something you don't really relate to, with the Hilton brand name. And the cleaners need to have a word with themselves, as the bin in the bathroom was full of used sanitary products, which i presume was left by the previous occupant, and when i informed reception, all they said was ""sorry about that"" and wasn't interested in the least. The breakfast wasn't really for me, as I'm not a fan of buffet style breakfasts."
1375,Paul,2023-02-13,"Nice hotel but felt a bit disappointed with the experience overall. I wouldn‚Äôt rush back. The hotel is well located and smartly decorated. The additional charge of ¬£20 for parking for 24 hours was a bit excessive. We had to wait a fair amount of time to check in, as there were only two members of staff on the desk. The room we stayed in was decorated nicely and smart at first glance, but after spending some time in there, I noticed quite a few stains all over the carpet and a big stain on the curtains. Breakfast was another additional charge, which we had to wait another ten minutes for a table and the food was pretty standard."
1376,Paul,2023-02-12,"not a bad stay but wouldn't rush back. location was good for local destinations. also breakfast was great value. The rooms are small, The televisions are out dated as only really 5 channels. So the rooms look tired and could do with modernizing."
1377,Michelle,2023-02-08,"convenient close to train station and centre have stayed before and been very happy with room but this room was not nice. walls stained and dirty, paint chipped from skirting and walls. room looked uncared for."

1382,Timothy,2023-01-19,freezing ! location it was freezing in my room. the hotel provided and extra plug in radiator but it wasn‚Äôt powerful enough to heat the room.

1385,Smokybarnable,2023-01-07,More like two star hotel The breakfast was quite good. Many different options to choose from. Pretty short walk from train station. For a four star hotel this felt more like a two star. Really old and outdated tired room. Air conditioning difficult to operate. Very noisy street below our room. Overpriced and not cozy.
1386,Michelle,2023-01-07,disappointed because it was cold in the property clean it was very cold
1387,Justin,2023-01-05,Rubbish Location ok The bathroom was dirty and stafff rude and Iv rang to complain not a phone call back very rude I call it and if I don‚Äôt hear from anyone one I will put the photos of the bathroom up for other to see
1388,Von,2023-01-03,"Dispute the minute and insignificant difficulties we experienced during our stay, this was more than made up for by the The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. They assisted with advice on local attractions, with calling taxi services, and with extra assistance when needed. Perfect customer service. Everything was very clean with essentials being catered for e.g. shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer. As a wheelchair user, I was very impressed that the hotel had the initiative to use sensor rather than pedal bins in their disabled toilets (this is a bugbear of mine) ‚ù§Ô∏è I am a wheelchair user. Although an accessible room was made available; the inside was furnished with carpet, making movement within the room more energy consuming; also there was a lip on the door frame, making it difficult to enter the room (chair tipping and opening a fire door is hard); and the initial room we were directed to had electrical issues (no plugs working)."
1389,Kokila,2022-12-31,"Exceptional The short footpath from the back access to the Knights Templar Church ruins. Beautiful and fascinating Medieval structure, the preserved exterior of it. Everything else except... Air con noisy in room. Shower was cool/cold."

1391,Nigel,2022-12-29,Pleasant Hotel is well placed and well appointed with comfortable rooms. During my stay there was an issue with water supply resulting in no hot water and while I realise this was not caused by the hotel I was only offered an explanation by staff when asking specifically about the problem and there was no apology for the disruption. Quality of the breakfast was poor on the occasion I stayed.
1392,David,2022-12-21,"not value for money, short staffed.  room not serviced, furniture broken, overcharged, cold plates breakfast. what's to like!!"

1402,Paul,2022-12-03,"Disappointed very nice hotel in good position restaurant was closed due to Christmas parties, no prior warning of this given. we were offered room service, which we ordered. food was great but had to sit on the bed to eat as no table, so was uncomfortable. no housekeeping done the following day so dirty dishes, wet towels and no tea making facilities replenished. when my husband spoke with receptionist to ask for clean towels for next day sadly no apologies given just oh it‚Äôs not been done! a very nice cleaning lady hastily brought fresh towels and took tray of plates that had sat in our room all day with remaining leftovers, just relieved that we didn‚Äôt order fish. All in all a very disappointing experience"
1403,Kamaljit,2022-12-02,Basic but clean Pleasant and friendly staff. Hotel is basic but clean. Toiletries weren't good and smelt awful. Decor is basic and needs updating. Some problem with water coming from tap and shower for a period in the morning. It was just a trickle.

1411,Sally,2022-11-21,"lovely staff, comfortable rooms clean, comfortable and a stunning garden out the back door. staff are super friendly, is walkable to get to centre. bus stop out the front door for longer trips and temple meads very close, 6 minute walk! expensive for a single night stay when it‚Äôs not right in the centre. on a main road and not much directly around building."
1412,James,2022-11-20,"average hotel, better and cleaner options available parking and location ok ish. stayed in better hotels dust in the vent over the shower, should have been cleaned and one ruber foot missing from the toilet seat. and every time we walked in and out past reception they never acknowledged us. not what you expect from a Hilton. bed very creaky too"
1413,Mark,2022-11-20,Exceptional Great hotel. Brilliant location for all that Bristol has to offer. Nothing. Great experience.

1418,Natasha,2022-11-09,"Pleasant Staff were lovely, room was clean. The mattress was very firm so much so that it was really uncomfortable for both myself and my mother. We also couldn't switch the aircon off which meant that it would get really warm or freezing during the night."

1421,Michael,2022-11-06,Staff were nice but pretty poor in not cleaning the room properly before we arrived. location was good and facilities and amenities were good Room wasn‚Äôt serviced so ran out of toilet paper and coffee. There were leftover takeaways in the fridge from what I assume was from guests before us. There was an empty toilet roll that wasn‚Äôt cleared away when we arrived.
1422,Imelda,2022-11-06,Exceptional Staff were world class A lot of road works due to building works made it difficult to navigate. Also 16¬£ for parking is a bit steep
1423,Mike,2022-11-02,"Ok place to stay Staff in the day were amazing, so helpful. Location is perfect. Night staff rude, bar closed early and they served people in suits, not metalheads. Bed was small and soft, uncomfortable."

1427,Melissa,2022-10-18,"disappointing and stuck in the 1980s proximity to the office I was working at , reception staff not much attention to detail eg room service menu on TV was low res and difficult to read. found a razor blade in my room, reported to reception (who apologised) but it was still there at the end of the day, staff at breakfast didn‚Äôt say good morning, irritating music playing in corridors, crisps cost ¬£2.75 for a small bag which I thought was a bit much"
1428,Adam,2022-10-17,"Adequate for 1 night but wouldn‚Äôt use again Good location. Car parking on site. Small room, very tiny bathroom. The bed was extraordinarily squeaky - so every time one of us moved it like wake the other up; the bed was also very uncomfortable. Seems we were overcharged for breakfast, booking says it should‚Äôve been ¬£10 but we were charged ¬£12 each."
1429,Jamie,2022-10-17,"staff are credit to the company. as for the hotel it‚Äôs very basic. sort your breakfast out before someone gets very ill the staff, very welcoming friendly and helpful. breakfast was horrific, and I mean terrible!!. rooms were very basic considering the price of the stay. like a overpriced travelodge."
1430,Alison,2022-10-16,greet place stay to see a show or shopping staff really helpful and friendly. not far from the train station. spotlessly clean. nothing
1431,Cristine,2022-10-12,Disappointing Friendly staff. Room cold. Unable to turn air conditioning fan off. Room dark. Felt overpriced
1432,Steve,2022-10-10,Great service and location Great service as always with comfy and clean rooms Breakfast- foods mixed together by other Guest using one spoon to take food. Affects dietary requirements meaning breakfast skipped.
1433,Izzy,2022-10-10,Overpriced but did what it needed to do whilst we were in Bristol for the weekend. The staff were friendly and welcoming upon arrival. The bedrooms need modernising. Creaky beds. Kept waking each other up when moving. Stains on the desk chair and kept lowering when sat on. Overall a very below average stay.
1434,Anne-marie,2022-10-08,Good for one night Breakfast was amazing it room more basic than expected and bed very hard Bed too hard and room very basic
1435,Rod,2022-10-06,Bar and car park prices extortionate Not good. Plates were cold. Ques for coffee tea machine. Toaster bleak Directions for car entry not provided for car park. ¬£16 per night to park in hotel own car park
1436,Lydia,2022-10-05,very good and tasty omlette made by the chef for breakfast friendly helpful staff located by busy road and being charged for parking the car.
1437,Matthew,2022-10-03,"Disappointing The staff on arrival were nice. There was no hand soap in the bathroom when we arrived. The shower gel dispenser come of the wall on the shower when used once. Went down for breakfast, nobody at the door to explain where to sit or give any guidance so basically had to sit on a table with no cutlery. Check out was basically we've already got your money bye. Wouldn't stay here again"
1438,Liam,2022-10-02,Pleasant good location and clean. rooms were basic but nice. breakfast and room very expensive for what you got
1439,Kailey,2022-10-02,"clean & convenient , very basic the rooms were clean, sadly next to our room and at the end of the corridor empty cans and left over room service orders were left there all weekend the bed was extremely hard and noisy, parking was difficult"
1440,Anthony,2022-09-28,Good shame about the bed  Bed was to hard and I could not sleep because it eas not comfortable for me
1441,Andrew,2022-09-28,"Good hotel for a weekend stay for a wedding Great location, nice hotel with a good breakfast. The hotel team were incredibly helpful and friendly. When I thought I had lost my phone they put the effort in to ensuring I got it back. The directions to the hotel on Google Maps weren't entirely clear due to the large amount of building works taking place nearby, and I initially got a little lost finding the entrance. Use the entrance on the main road up from the station for easiest access."
1442,Judith,2022-09-27,"It was very convenient and comfortable. Parking was convenient, staff friendly breakfast was good. no hot water for shower on first day. extractor fan in bathroom didn't work. Bathroom very small and not very well equipped."
1443,Amanda,2022-09-25,Definitely not value for money. Won‚Äôt be revisiting ( and we visit Bristol regularly) Location Staff Parking Food. Poor quality breakfast and menu for room service and quality of food also poor No obvious information provided in the room about WiFi room service etc
1444,Vasantha,2022-09-25,"Fair Location is good. Written info in room, there‚Äôs was info on the TVPlayer."
1445,Richard,2022-09-24,Great apart from the broken lifts! Excellent staff. All very helpful and professional. The lift was broken. Luckily an excellent staff member carried my heavy bags up the stairs
1446,Yolanda,2022-09-22,Got exactly what we wanted Staff were so helpful and super polite Bed was so uncomfortable. I just don‚Äôt like firm mattresses so that‚Äôs my opinion really
1447,Hayley,2022-09-21,amazing! the manager & staff was very accommodating nothing it was perfect
1448,Zackary,2022-09-20,"amazing, professional and polite, the whole experience was amazing Room and Breakfast"
1449,Andy,2022-09-20,"Good location if travelling on foot. Good location in Bristol The on-site parking is very limited (and expensive) with small spaces and hard to navigate in anything but a small car. Also you are paying for the Hilton name, rooms a little tired for money paid."
1450,Aaron,2022-09-19,"really underwhelming, it was meant for an anniversary and my partner was really disappointed with the whole experience The location was perfect for what we wanted, also the bar area was lovely. The room was definitely not worth what I paid, there was dust on the top of everything, the lamp was broke, the bed was uncomfortable and the flush didn‚Äôt work properly in bathroom."
1451,Christopher,2022-09-18,"Location great, feel its a little expensive for the facilities and standard level off room Lactation was perfect for us as we just a short walk away from the Hippodrome for a show. Plenty of choice at breakfast and food was tasty. Upon arrival I was informed at reception that there is a ¬£16 fee to use the hotel carpark. Nowhere did I see this mentioned when booking the hotel. I have never had to do this in any other hotel I've visited. I feel this extra charge made my stay not great value for money with this extra charge on top."
1452,Isobel,2022-09-17,"Enjoyable stay in this nice hotel Nice hotel, friendly, helpful staff and thought their menu was good. Would go back again There was nothing I could find fault with"

1455,Debra,2022-09-12,Perfect overnight city stay clean and comfortable bed City centre within walking distance of wedding venue we were attending
1456,Richard,2022-09-10,Disappointing nothing Most things. haven‚Äôt got time to type it all
1457,Alexander,2022-09-09,"Not worth the money! Location Ground floor accessible room allocated when requested high floor room, dated in places, bathroom sliding door didn‚Äôt open and close properly. Not asked how my Stay was at reception checking out and hot breakfast was cold- bacon and hash brown."
1458,Happy0427,2022-09-08,Great service by a great team Staff were 100% a credit Facilities were good Room was good It was raining Drinks at the bar were expensive
1459,Lou,2022-09-08,Urgent refurbishment required Nothing Now a very tired hotel. Needs total refurbishment to meet the Hilton group standards! Definitely not worth the money
1460,Sara,2022-09-04,"Exceptional Great location, very clean and modern. Friendly.,helpful staff, good value buffet breakfast with great selection. The shower wasn't as powerful as we like."
1461,Ben,2022-09-04,"Passable I had high hopes for this hotel as I associate the Hilton with nice properties. When we arrived at our room it absolutely stank of cigarette smoke. There was constant noise throughout the night in the corridor which was not stopped by anyone . The bed wasn‚Äôt very comfortable . to be fair, the staff were all very pleasant it was just the room that let it down- we paid a little more to stay in this nicer hotel and would have had a better time in a cheaper competitor ."
1462,Karin,2022-08-30,Just what we were looking for. Great value and location close to the city centre. very friendly helpful staff. rel pillows too big
1463,Bland,2022-08-30,"All in all positive experience, would return staff were extremely friendly and helpful. light didn‚Äôt work in wardrobe, no shower gel in bottle in the shower. Attention to detail with these things could be improved"
1464,Traveller,2022-08-30,"Not value for money  Breakfast was poor quality, poached eggs were drowned in vinegar, cheese was dry and curling and salad was old Room hadn‚Äôt been cleaned properly and was dusty, soaps were empty and hadn‚Äôt been refilled No room cleaning on the third day Pillows very thin No plug socket on both sides of bed"
1465,Kevin,2022-08-29,clean and tidy but not again due to price and location. location parking and run down area of the city
1466,Edwin,2022-08-29,"It was ok. for the price goodish. It was clean and the staff delightful Over my life I have stayed at many Hiltons, all very good, to mention Park Lane , London and many times at The Gatwick Hilton, delightful. I was mislead maybe because of the name Hilton, The Hotel I stayed in was not a Hilton, my fault as I should have considered the price more, but there it is, it was just an average good hotel."
1467,Julia,2022-08-29,Bristol trip Location good and the knight templer history in close proximity Very hard bed. The bed had wheels made alot of noise especially whilst turning in bed.. One morning the breakfast was cold I had to as ask for it to be microwaved.
1468,Mathew,2022-08-23,Disappointed. Expected more from the Hilton brand.. Breakfast was as expected Unable to get served food on both evenings of our stay. Arrived early evening expecting to be able to eat in the hotel restaurant- unable to be served as the Restuarant had a block booking on both nights. Very disappointed. Not even offered a snack or sandwich üò¶
1469,Allan,2022-08-23,This straw broke the camel‚Äôs (and my) back Location is brilliant for my office. Staff are welcoming and friendly despite the challenges they have to overcome. Beds are the worst I have ever slept in (including wartime German bunks) Air conditioning was so noisy it couldn‚Äôt be used at night despite 20 degree heat outside Desk light didn‚Äôt work so couldn‚Äôt work in the evening. Reported it but nobody came to sort it out. Room was not cleaned or replenished for the two nights I was there The restaurant couldn‚Äôt feed staying guests for the two nights because of large coach parties booked in Such a shame because our two businesses use this hotel on a regular basis but we‚Äôre moving up the road.
1470,Alexander,2022-08-21,"Poor Air con didn't work, so we were moved to another room by the really nice staff. They sorted this ASAP. Amazing beds! Very clean and nice decor. Our floor smelled of weed, I think the people in the room opposite were smoking it. Creeped through our door and all our stuff started to smell of it slightly. The TV's in the room are awful. Old, non HD, wouldn't work as intended. We found it really slow/hard to change channels etc."
1471,Paul,2022-08-21,"We were a little disappointed with certain aspects of the room we were allocated The staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast was good. Overall, the cleanliness of the room and shower room was good. Charge of ¬£16 to Park in the hotel car park was rather high. The bed and pillows were very hard and difficult to sleep on. Bottles of shower gel/shampoo in the shower were all empty. Carpet was rather tired with old stains"
1472,Ceri,2022-08-16,Wouldn‚Äôt stay here again Some staff were lovely. Room not ready upon arrival even though I‚Äôd stated an arrival time. Dirty linen in corridors every day. Beds uncomfortable and creaking.Breakfast poor overcooked bacon undercooked sausages and cold eggs. Restaurant closed one night no prior notice given. Everything
1473,Amelia,2022-08-15,"Enjoyable , relaxing , great service Facilities , staff , lovely food at restaurant and the choice at breakfast . Bedroom was nice Carpark was very expensive saying you‚Äôve paid a lot already booking a room . Also air con not very powerful in the rooms especially during the hot weather"
1474,Matt,2022-08-15,"Very bad nights sleep Location to harbour side The room was stiflingly hot, the air conditioning was not working across the whole hotel. I asked for a fan which the staff provided but it just blew hot air around the room. We did not sleep at all... I expected a lot more from a Hilton hotel. The was also no pre warning of this, had there been we'd have chosen a different hotel!"
1475,Minnette,2022-08-12,"we come every year, great hotel great staff it was easily accessible, clean and refreshing lemon water was on tap in reception brilliant the cooler didn‚Äôt work but we‚Äôre offered another room but we were just along from my brothers room"
1476,Elke,2022-08-11,Pleasant Location was good and the park behind the hotel was beautiful. The staff were nice. It was really expensive for what it was and U looked on other days and the price was a lot less and included breakfast. We paid ¬£260 for two night twin room and breakfast wasn't included - although I thought it was supposed to be. It was really loud on our first night over night.
1477,Mrs,2022-08-10,"Pleasant, but with flaws..... Best thing ,i have to say was the chef and restaurant staff,for our breakfast the following morning...I have ms and eat particuler food combinations..Not totally strange, but most places, find requests hard at times...My husband enjoyed his big breakfast immensely(he's a normal)..and mine 2 eggs on avocado(no toast) ...perfect...even made me a smoothie to drink...Great start to the day and rounded, a not so great start to our break to, excellent....People sometimes need to remember ,that it's the small things that count............... Reception on arrival...Was a hot day, and our journey was full of traffic, not the hotels fault granted...BUT,..We were due to check-in at 3pm and didnt arrive till 4.15...to find room not ready??..Sitting in lobby and left with the option of 'choc or crisps' ...no...So as receptionist didnt see the need to give/suggest another ready room, i did her job and approached to ask for another ready room...Granted........See not hard...BUT would have been better some forsight on her part....The Hilton Garden Inn, not a chain that i would think needed a customer service skills reminder...........!"
1478,John,2022-08-08,"Exceptional The staff, location and atmosphere of the hotel was brilliant. Everything was perfect. No complaints at all."
1479,Emma,2022-08-08,"Fun All the staff were so helpful and friendly. Gary especially was an absolute star! Making sure we had blankets and drinks whilst sat outside the bar and his sense of humour was brilliant! Price of room, very over priced"

1483,Steven,2022-08-06,"Great hotel to visit Friendly service, Annie and Jenny on front desk were so kind and helpful. Annie went over and above to help us with accommodation for late arrival of my son who needed 2 rooms for his family which made a difficult situation easily sorted out. Can't thank her enough also for giving us ground floor room as my wife's legs were bad and she doesn't like lifts. Wonderful experience all round and will definitely be back on our next visit to Bristol. Lovely staff good breakfast EXCELLENT."
1484,Samantha,2022-08-06,"The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and we had a wonderful stay! I love the property, it‚Äôs always clean and tidy and the rooms are great value for money. But the staff are the greatest. Nothing to dislike"
1485,Sue,2022-08-05,Good place to stay Location difficult to find by car. Food ok
1486,Tammie,2022-08-04,"Could have been better Staff were really pleasant and helpful. Restaurant and bar area was lovely and breakfast was great. Our room was an accessible room and felt a little snug. Bed was small but comfortable. Window led out onto the street making the room feel a little overlooked and the rubber seal around the window was loose and hanging. The bathroom was brilliant - plenty of room with excellent facilities but the door would not close properly. The ceiling especially, but also the walls and skirt boards were marked or scuffed, giving the room an overall tired feel."
1487,Natalie,2022-08-04,Exceptional Very helpful friendly staff. Knowledgeable of the area
1488,Michael,2022-08-04,"Could not have wished for a better stay, made very welcomed and even the weather held. The staff were exceptional very polite and helpful the breakfast was excellent and the location could not have been better. The bathroom was a little small, could not turn the heating right down but that could be me"
1489,Natalie,2022-08-02,Exceptional Hotel was Ok bed comfortable and nice shower. For the price of ¬£9.50 breakfast was not worth is very sparse options and what was there wasn't great. Coffee there was terrible. overall for the price of the room I paid ¬£320 for two nights it was not worth it.
1490,Mark,2022-07-31,Basic and not a value for money Room was basic but ok The hotel is weary and in need of some renovations.
1491,David,2022-07-31,"Disappointing - not like I expect a Hilton to be The staff were very helpful Room was too hot, bed was tiny, roadworks all round the hotel made it impossible to get to using sat nav, and had to end up ringing hotel.

1497,Carol,2022-07-20,we had a late check in. Receptionist didn‚Äôt have a clue what to do. Near centre of town Breakfast staff were not advising guests where things were. People were walking around trying to find things. Guy in charge VERY condescending.
1498,Jade,2022-07-19,"Amazing stay, great staff great place will be back! Staff was all really helpful and professional. The full English breakfasts was cooked lovely. they had a really good range of other options too, such as fruit cereals meats /cheese ect. They made it really special for us by popping proceco in our room on ice. At a reasonable charge.They called to confirm everything before our stay too! Thankyou to all the staff we will be back again. We didn't have any issues with the rooms or facility's but some mini toothpaste in the room?"
1499,Suvinder,2022-07-17,it was just tolerable it was very basic parking was poor
1500,Burgin,2022-07-16,"I'll do that when I get my bill The staff were exceptional Not receiving my bill yet,it's a disgrace"
1501,Linda,2022-07-15,"Have had much better experience at other Hilton‚Äôs . it had a wardrobe in the room ( missing at premier inns) fridge was very handy . The shower was pathetic no pressure what so ever , hard mattress, very hard and uncomfortable pillows, bar person unhelpful , I can‚Äôt believe you don‚Äôt stock a 2nd bottle of Malibu . the measure was the last bit in the bottom but due to it being about 3mm short of the full measured barman refused to serve it , he refused to see if you had further stock just said you didn‚Äôt without looking . A bit of a disappointing visit . your standards appear to have dropped."
1502,Brian,2022-07-12,"Pokey room and don't arrive hungry! Check in/out was efficient Access with a car is impossible. You have to turn into a one-way street, going the wrong way, from the main road. Otherwise, you can't access it. GoogleMaps can't even find the correct entrance. No filter coffee for breakfast - only Americano from a full automatic. Dreadful. I arrived at 22:15 and couldn't even get a sandwich. The kitchen closes at 21:45 and there's nothing nearby. I ended up walking 2km to a McD and eating it in a bus shelter!"

1506,Natalia,2022-07-08,"lobby downstairs was deceiving because it looked very new. The hotel overall just needs a good refurbishment, it is a Hi Staff were absolutely amazing, nice and kind very professional!! the rooms were ridiculously small. Paid for a Queen Room which I thought was a larger room but it wasn‚Äôt. the bathroom was smaller than a cupboard which was a massive no."
1507,Josh,2022-07-05,"Exceptional Located about a 5 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station. Staff, especially front desk and Food & Beverage, especially friendly and helpful. Have no real complaints. business center with access to desktop computer and printer would be helpful."
1508,Chris,2022-07-04,Disappointing will not go again.  Two single beds pushed together are not a king size bed. They were uncomfortable. Breakfast poor quality. Lack of fruit. Most tasteless. Felt like works canteen.
1509,Jacqueline,2022-07-04,Excellent service throughout The staff were very friendly and helpful..and location was good...room was comfortable and they were kind enough to let us have an accessible room.. Nothing that I would say was bad and that I didnt like..
1510,Michelle,2022-06-28,Hard mattress and nothing extra to justify paying the Hilton price. Close to the train station and some shops and restaurants are not too far away. The bed was too hard. Considering the hotel was a Hilton I expected something more.

1516,Joan,2022-06-20,"Disappointing as Hilton hotels are normally such high quality Breakfast was fine and the location was good. The towels were badly marked. Our room wasn't cleaned, bed made, clean towels etc on last day. We didn't get back to the hotel until 12am so didn't bother complaining. There was mould on the shower frame."

1522,Allan,2022-06-14,"Great location, good food, friendly staff, take a mattress topper great location, friendly but overworked staff, good food the beds are awful.

1523,Thomas,2022-06-14,Not worth ¬£75.00 will not be staying again it was clean and reception staff were helpful The mattress was rock solid and there was no water in the bedroom
1524,Anthea,2022-06-13,"Short Break Friendly staff, comfy bed, nice small gym with modern equipment and clean communal areas. Terrible parking. Bays should be allocated on booking to allow guests to come and go as they please rather than be to scared to drive as they will not get a space on return. Stains on the blackout blinds looked like oil, room small for two adults, no usb points in these modern times, room was clean but looked a bit old fashioned. Small bathroom, paint flaking above shower. Bit far from restaurants if you have to walk as you don't want to lose your parking space."
1525,Mark,2022-06-12,"Easy to book, difficult to get parked, staff very helpful but room too hot and it was noisy Staff were great, hotel was clean Parking a nightmare. Room too hot even with air con. Noisy streets below"

1528,Mairsil,2022-06-08,"Everything expected from a luxury hotel Very friendly staff, clean comfortable room, well furnished, and with all the small luxuries you'd expect from a Hilton. Nice location real close to the station and walking distance from the city Doesn't have the charm of a small hotel with unique rooms, but that's to be expected"
1529,Emma,2022-06-07,Just what was needed We had to book very last minute when our easyJet flight home was cancelled. The booking was easy & staff very friendly
1530,Nix,2022-06-06,"Stay ruined by noise and loud, drunk guests Very friendly and helpful staff. Great facilities. Room was large, clean and comfortable. I am surprised that it turned out to be a ""party hotel"" - I expect better of Hilton. We were woken several times in the night including from 1-1:30am by drunk people running around the corridors, doors banging, and shouting (we were on the 3rd floor). Such a shame and spoiled what would otherwise have been an excellent stay."
1531,Hollie,2022-06-05,best hotel stay this year amazing care from all staff and even had free drinks for a birthday! extremely comfortable bed and lovely facilities

1538,Paul,2022-05-25,"OK but pricey for what it is Very comfy bed, good temperature in the room, nice bathroom. Very expensive for parking and drinks. Went to Wetherspoons for breakfast and saved a fortune!"

Nothing to like, 1 star hotel under the name of Hilton.Bad management.Very rude receprionist.No securised Wifi, dirty room, 1 shower gel for 2 pers., bed on wheels like in the hospital, no controlled AC, only ventilation full of bacterias.Tiny bathroomHorror view from the room.Stay away!"
1548,Hajnalka,2022-05-11,Just what we needed for a night stay. Close to train station. Glass of lemon water at reception was a very nice touch. Receptionist was very welcoming. The pillows were not very comfortable.
1549,Sean,2022-05-09,"Great stay, thank you! Great location, super team of people. Room great and an amazingly good breakfast The only thing I didn't like was seeing the red indicator below this box that I am writing in slowly change to green as I type....there was nothing that we could fault with our stay at Browns. I am sure that many other people go and stay at places with the sole purpose to find fault...if only they bothered to engage with the people who run and work in hospitality not treat them and what they do with disdain and a negative outlook. It's green now, so I'll stop!"
1550,Joanne,2022-05-07,avoid at the weekend if you like to sleep room was clean and comfortable. bed and bathroom fine. nice park to look out on to. whole corridor on which we stayed became a party venue with people rolling in at 0230 shouting singing banging doors. managed to drown out the party noise by hiking up the aircon but could still hear the doors banging as they went from room to room. kept awake from 0230 until the sun came up about 0530. reception useless. no signs anywhere asking people to be quiet when coming in late. no security to deal with the yobs. Travelodge and Premier Inn have family corridors and signage asking people to be considerate when coming in late. reception said that it was too difficult for the Hilton to arrange this. won‚Äôt be back. very disappointed. if you can‚Äôt sleep properly at a hotel it‚Äôs failed really hasn‚Äôt it?
1551,Richard,2022-05-06,Great hotel would highly recommend Lovely location very friendly polite and curtious great price good value for money lovely hotel room very spacious all little extras such as fridge and safe could not fault it in anyway would definitely recommend to all went that extra mile in every way Nothing

1565,Rachel,2022-04-17,"Extremely Disappointing Property was in a good location. Rooms are tired and dirty. The bed was on wheels and had to be the loudest bed I‚Äôve ever slept on. Noise levels were high, hoovering early in the morning. Would not stay again."
1566,Eric,2022-04-15,A great break to celebrate our anniversary. Room had nice view and was quiet. The hotel was close to the railway station with a very easy walk. We had an evening meal which was well prepared and the staff were cheerful and attentive. Shower room extraction fan not working

1571,Henry,2022-04-05,"One night stay, very comfortable and very pleasant and helpful staff. I stayed on the 4th floor and the room was really clean and tidy. There was not much noise other than what you would expect from a hotel. It's not that it put me off the hotel, as it didn't, but the facility to have water to drink in the room would have been an added bonus, Though there is a massive water cooler in the reception, it's not practical to come up and down from the 4th floor to get some."
1572,Andrew,2022-04-04,Exceptional The best hotel üè® üëå All of it the room was great and the food thank you

1574,Colin,2022-04-04,"frustrating Hilton to me is synonymous with quality which to be honest was found a little wanting. staff were pretty good when you pointed things out to them. had some discount on bills because of things going wrong. Booked king room, shown into a normal room. had to be relocated once we pointed this out . TV non functional which apparently was the same in all the rooms, staff had reported it apparently but it was an issue for all of our stay and had been for the previous week. Bit of plastic bag found in my soup, directions to hotel need updating due to all the construction work taking place in the vicinity,"
1575,Samantha,2022-04-04,"Great üëç Breakfast was great. Staff very friendly and helpful. Room & whole hotel was very clean Only 2 tv channels working but reception staff provided free drinks as compensation, so we were quite happy!"

1578,Timothy,2022-03-28,Poor The cocktails Being over charged at the end of are stay though the mistake of the hotel staff.and the large amount of dust in our room also and the lack of information in the room.and the breakfast was absolutely disgusting.
1579,Allan,2022-03-28,"Enjoyed Bristol with the hotel being close to Temple Meads and the water ferry. Handy for Temple Meads and not too far to walk to the city centre. The hotel is clean and modern i.e. with the uniformity that goes with new-builds. For the price I would have expected more space in the room and en-suite. The hotel is having problems with its supplier and many of the electronics don't work adequately - wi-fi and tv. Breakfast was buffet style and over-priced, with the lamp-warmers seemingly placed too high to adequately warm the food."

1581,Bernice,2022-03-24,Exceptional The decor was lovely .. beautiful dining room .. staff were extremely helpful . There was a lovely smell of a diffuser that I really liked The noise when you opened the window but that‚Äôs only to be expected due to the location
1582,Christopher,2022-03-24,Poor Location room was no where near the same standard as other city centre Hilton‚Äôs we have stayed in and way to much money for the lack of quality.

1584,Melissa,2022-03-20,"Well-situated, clean and complete amenities First hotel with a laundry room instead of the overpriced laundry services. it was super helpful. for me this was the best perk ever. breakfast is good with various choices for every taste, gym is clean, view to park is nice. close to the train station, which is convenient. Friendly staff. Overall very satisfied."
1585,Dimple,2022-03-20,"Passable Location, staff, breakfast was good but not available for long enough. Room wasnt super clean, was run down. Toiletries available were limited. Disappointing for a hilton."
1586,Dan,2022-03-20,"Room was fine, facilities not. Night staff also rude. Room was clean One tv channel worked, asked the staff about it ended up with two members of staff in my room at unsocial-able hours trying to get to wire at the back of the tv when I told them it was already not possible as I had looked myself they insisted on staying in the room and messing with the remote which again I had told them I had already done so and then became rude when I asked them to leave and stayed for more longer than needed."
1587,Tony,2022-03-18,"overpriced, room price inflated due to Cheltenham race‚Äôs which we were unaware room rate was ¬£100 dearer than normal and location small room, very small bathroom, noisy heating system"

1589,Alison,2022-03-13,"Passable Location very good, hotel seemed in reasonable condition Two nights in a row I was awake between 3am and 4.30am with noise of drunk people in rooms nearby and in the hallway. I let the hotel know after the first night, they sent me a message to apologise and said they would keep an eye out the next night. The 2nd night was worse. Music and people in room next door, people in corridor shouting to try find their room because they couldn't find key or remember where they were staying, trying random doors, slamming doors. I gave the feedback to the receptionist as I checked out and she apologised and says it wasn't within their control. I beg to differ. I have travelled at lot with work over the years and this was not acceptable; its your hotel, you make the rules. You knew there was potential for disturbance and did not take responsibility."
1590,Charlotte,2022-03-06,Passable Location was good Beds were really uncomfortable. Doors banging throughout the night until 3am. Worst nights sleep I‚Äôve had in a long time. Room was tiny.

1592,Sandra,2022-03-01,Exceptional Great location near train station and shopping centre.. Super friendly and helpful staff.. The only fault personal to me was the bed was to firm.. took some getting used to.. But a lot of people like a firm bed..

The breakfast had a good variety of choice and was well presented and good quality. The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. There was nothing to fault
1596,Joanne,2022-02-24,"Nice stay but overpriced Room was very clean but quite small despite upgrading. Location was good, Breakfast was excellent. Staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant was very overpriced so ate out Stayed at a premier inn for the first night and felt the extra 40 pounds extra to stay at the Hilton didn't warrant the price. Premier had much larger rooms, nice bar and restaurant. However breakfast was not as good as the Hilton. Unfortunately due to location and value for money I would return to the premier Inn which is a shame."

There was also somewhere to store luggage The bed definitely was not as comfortable as I was expecting from a Hilton. The bar was also very basic and standard, I was hoping for something a bit more stylish or special. Not a great deal of selection of drinks. It didnt feel any better than a budget hotel."

1613,Paul,2022-01-24,"Nice enough but never coming back, overpriced for what you get. Friendly staff, good location. Parking on site (albeit chargeable) Room was small, bed too firm, pillows were awful had a terrible sleep. For some reason there was an extra chair in the room that did nothing but get in the way as it was too big. Breakfast was OK but items had been sat around for a while - the poached eggs were hard boiled."
1614,Ei,2022-01-23,Exceptional I couldn't express how much I was satisfied with this Hilton Garden Inn. The room was extremely clean and we can smell the good washing from the blankets and the pillows. The people who give services were also nice and polite. 100% Thumb-up!

1632,Serena,2021-12-20,"Unsafe  There were guests banging on the walls, screaming in the hallway and knocking on the room of my door right the way through the night. At 3.30am I went downstairs to tell reception, and as I came back up to my room after this - a man in nothing but his underwear was stood outside my hotel room door. I felt extremely uncomfortable and unsafe. After telling the night staff, the noise stopped for about 30 minutes then commenced again at 4am. Myself and my friend in my twin room got no sleep. My friend decided to leave the hotel at 5.30am because all the banging and knocking on our door made them have a panic attack. I did not feel safe either and did not get any sleep"
1633,Mark,2021-12-19,we will stay here again very clean and staff fro
1634,Neil,2021-12-19,"Ok, but poor value. No breakfast as needed to catch 07.00 train and not available. Lovely staff at breakfast but poor food available only. Small rooms in need of refurbishment. Not up to quality indicated by price. No water in the room. Tiny bathroom."
1635,Pooja,2021-12-15,Highly recommend. Will definitely be staying here again Great location and room. The breakfast was wonderful too. Best of all was the customer servicing and the staff.

All the staff we encountered were exceptionally helpful and characterised by cheerfulness. The location is excellent for access to the City centre. Breakfast was very good and a wide choice of menu was available in the restaurant each day and evening. The bar was well stocked and welcoming with extremely obliging staff. We will be visiting Bristol again in a few months and will definitely stay here. Nothing. This was excellent value for money and we will stay again."

As a seasoned travel, I have to say this was probably the best hotel experience I've ever had. Professional, Polite, Friendly and Caring. I cannot complement all staff highly enough. Nothing."

1662,Laura,2021-11-16,"A very nice, clean, comfortable hotel to spend a couple of nights in Bristol The room was surprisingly nice! I had not expected it to look so new and modern and it was impeccably clean. The bed was big and EXTREMELY comfortable - my partner has back issues and this mattress was one of the few during our trip that he felt at ease sleeping on. The place had plenty of mirrors for getting ready to go out for a night or for a walkabout in the morning. It also had a lot of storage available in the room. The hotel provided shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap, and body lotion (as per usual), but they smelled very nice and didn't feel cheap like so many often do. The wifi was very strong and we had no issues getting online. The room was very quiet. We didn't hear any of the other guests or anyone on the street outside during our stay despite only staying on the first floor. The view from the windows of the park across was nice, though best experienced in the day as not much could be seen at night. The hotel was very easy to navigate. Parking was very simple. We were able to get a 24-hour parking pass from the time of our arrival and keep the car in the small lot just in front of the hotel making our worries about leaving our car in a lot down the street unnecessary. The fee for the 24-hour stay was only ¬£16, very affordable compared to the other park and pay options in the area. The staff were very helpful at check-in and check-out. Nothing comes to mind - the stay was very pleasant and everything you would hope for from a night in a hotel in a new city. The only blip was with the parking fee. We thought we paid the fee at check-in but the clerk was a bit busy and must not have completed the transaction so we received a bill for parking in the morning after thinking that we had already paid for it. It was easily worked out at the front desk at checkout and the money had not been taken from our account. So it was a non-issue in the end."

The staff are all very pleasant, helpful & accommodating. The room was lovely with the view, clean & tidy. The bed was comfortable. The other areas of the hotel are also very clean & tidy. Breakfast was good & had a variety of either continental or cooked. I'd stay here again without any hesitation in the future for sure."
1667,Keith,2021-11-15,"Adequate were not at the hotel due to being out all day. The closeness to Temple Mead Station. The room being ready before normal check in. The well trained staff. The room was of adequate size but rather tired , stains to carpet, dressing table drawers falling to pieces so drawers did not shut. we had booked into the Recess bar /restaurant . we had looked at the on line menu and the prices seemed reasonable although menu was not very extensive . We arrived for our 6.30 booking the the noise from a large group of drinkers was horrendous - not good when you suffer from tinnitus; the menu was even more reduced; the prices had gone up and the portions very small my husbands piece of fish was the size of a childs portion. My Husband received a charge docket which he signed very surprised to find additional charges for service and and tips. If there was a note on the menu re these charges it was that small it was missed."

1669,Julie,2021-11-13,Ok Our room was overlooking the garden which was lovely. But unfortunately over the bar area which was very noisy at night. The beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable. The pillows were cheap and very soft. The breakfast was very good with great choice. The staff were very friendly and very accommodating. See above
1670,Hilmir,2021-11-10,"Nice Hotel. It¬¥s a nice Hotel that I have booked a few times, nice breakfast, comfy bed and nice shower. It¬¥s a in a good location, short walk from the centre, nice and helpful staff. The Rooms are outdate and in dire need of update, carpets were dirty, desk chair was old and tired, arm ripped and it would not hold it¬¥s position. The room was dirty and could have used better cleaning. Check out made us loose our train into London as the nightshift had refunded my payment and I was charged again in the morning. But helpful manager sorted it out but it took a bit of time."

All the food was barely warm and made worse with thick cold plates. Example _ eggs fried and left to get cold for ages, scrambled eggs over cooked and almost cold ,along with everything else, no where near worth the money. Try eating a breakfast at 8.30 am and see if you agree"

1692,Stuartvilla,2021-10-24,"Poor sleep on first of 2 nights. We went as to run a race the first of our two mornings. However very disturbed sleep on our first of two nights. TV in the next room was on full volume on our return at 11 pm. Could never sleep through this, after 3 hours at 2 AM I phoned reception who then came quickly. They entered the room 436 and muted the TV. Ruined our rest and our run was nothing like we thought it would be,due to lack of sleep. Everything else was great,but the main reason for our stay was to have a goodnight sleep for our run. Room 434 was very nice, but why no porter to check floors? it was obvious to us in the corridor that TV was way too loud. Why do TVs need such loud volume in a hotel? A real shame as many lovely things to say of the hotel but our memories are all about our lack of sleep. Alter maximum volume on TVs maybe then this could never have happened."
1693,Philip,2021-10-20,Exceptional Great location. Easy access to train station
1694,Nikita,2021-10-17,"Birthday weekend The property is in a great location, the staff were super friendly and everything was very clean The room was small considering the price we paid. The TV was almost useless in our room, poor signal and very few channels with no TV guide or info. Quite disappointing for an expensive room. There are minimal facilities but this is understandable given the location and size."
1695,Kristina,2021-10-16,"Passable Location EV charger not working, or non ev cars parked in spaces therefore unable to charge our car No tv remote in bedroom Bed really hard and creaky. Organised a later checkout before arriving but was asked multiple times when we were leaving meaning having to explain over and over."
1696,Mae,2021-10-13,Pleasant It was clean and accessible. At night I can hear pipes or some noise that sound like water or someone running a bath or something. It went on all evening and I‚Äôm a light sleeper so I count sleep. That‚Äôs a big deal for me.
1697,Taylor,2021-10-11,"Kinda like a one night stand, alright for a one off but wouldn't go again Close walk to the city centre. First off I put in my notes that we were celebrating a birthday weekend and if they could make it special, they replied saying they have put it in their notes. Absolutely nothing on arrival. Also paying for parking on site is a massive downfall to the location."
1698,Natasha,2021-10-11,Exceptional Very welcoming and approachable staff
1699,Bea,2021-10-07,"This hotel does not deserve your custom . The room was a standard size, and the bathroom had a good shower with good hot water. The room had a good wardrobe and storage space, which is a rarity. Breakfast, which I paid for includes in the price, was really good, including plant based options. The hotel restaurant had reasonable food. Small portions and some unreasonably expensive but others a good value for money. Restaurant/breakfast staff were really nice. The hotel fitness room was small and rather basic (i.e no barbells). The hotel is 10 mins from the train station and 10mins from the city centre. Although on a busy road I didn't find the room noisy, although truth be said I never have trouble sleeping! The hotel has a ""no housekeeping "" policy at the moment. This meant I had to take my dirty mugs to reception and ask for clean mugs, my room was not hoovered during my stay, let alone the rest of the room tidied. To suggest this is because of ""COVID safety measures"" is an insult to your customers, considering that all the staff (including and particularly the housekeeping staff) are about their business without wearing masks and that there is no contact between the housekeeping staff and the guest during housekeeping. This is blunt cost cutting disguised as a COVID measure. When I challenged reception about this I was told that I had been misinformed (despite the fact I was given a written notice specifying no housekeeping will be done) housekeeping was available if booked the evening before...I don't know, perhaps the virus takes exception when it's told someone will do the room in advance? I'm not sure whether I'm more crosses about the lack of service or the insult of the hotel trying to pretend it's about COVID. And of course no harm will happen to me for not having housekeeping for a few days, but if I pay for a hotel it's because I want that extra pampering, otherwise, I book an Airbnb which is cheaper and where I do my own hoovering and pot washing. This hotel does not deserve your custom and your hard earned cash."
1700,Julie,2021-10-03,"Good location, very clean. Excellent wifi The hotel was very well located, 5 mins walk from Temple Meads station and right in the city. The staff were very helpful providing us with extra toiletries on request and arranging a taxi to the airport for us. The room was very comfortable and clean and quiet despite being on a main road. The wifi was excellent. Lovely shower and heated mirror that cleared instantly. Good hairdryer, iron and ironing board in room. Very impressed - will stay there again"
1701,Jonathan,2021-09-29,Passable Location good For the price the room was very small. Mid week meal at home was far better than the supposed chef at work for the evening meal. Breakfast okay but cold. Not value for money in my experience and wouldn‚Äôt stay at a Hilton again. Very over rated.
1702,Vicki,2021-09-23,"Fantastic customer service Superb Great food, fantastic helpful staff. Really good value for money No problems at all"
1703,Claudia,2021-09-22,"Quality not as good as other Hilton hotels. Room OK, but breakfast was disappointing. Good location in relation to the city centre. Bed was comfortable, nice toiletry products. Breakfast was disappointing. Waffle machine was out of order, not enough cheese and cut meats available, no croissants available. Everything was a bit low on quality. The reception staff were grumpy. Next day they were friendly, but then grumpy again in the afternoon. Very changeable."
1704,David,2021-09-22,Very good hotel to stay. Breakfast was really good and with a good choice to choose from. Easy to get to from the railway station and just a short walk from the docks.

1706,Alex,2021-09-20,"Not good value for money. Much better value for nicer hotels can be found in city centre Location to Bristol city centre and friendliness and helpfulness of the staff Value is terrible. Nearly 200 euros (not including breakfast) for 1 night given how utilitarian the hotel is. It is not a pretty hotel. I stayed in the Leonardo Hotel across the road during the same weekend for less than half the price, which is a lot more luxurious, larger bedroom and bathroom."
1707,Rita,2021-09-20,"Highly recommend Central, clean and comfortable Staff were friendly and took time to chat with you and gave advice on things to do & see. Couldn‚Äôt fault the room or the service Would go back Nothing"

1711,Fredrik,2021-09-20,"Disappointing  Room was not cleaned, even though we asked for it (after 3 nights). It's a ripoff not to do daily cleaning and still maintain the high prices. Room price far too high for the standard. Bad selection on cold breakfast items."

1713,Patricia,2021-09-14,"Bad Location only The manager was so rude, air conditioning in the premium room 1604 was not working yet they checked us in.

1716,Stuart,2021-09-11,"Disappointing The location is good and the hotel has parking. The staff we met were helpful and polite. The shower was terrible (no pressure, little heat, broken door) and the breakfast was the worst I‚Äôve had in a hotel."
1717,Louise,2021-09-11,"overnight stay General comfort was good and staff were very nice , air con is very noisy and it‚Äôs difficult because it‚Äôs not possible to open the windows.so I couldn‚Äôt sleep. no bath only showers. fire alarm was set off at 1:45 am and I had to get down 5 flights of stairs into the car park."
1718,Jon,2021-09-09,"Will insist on other side of hotel because of the traffic noise which kept us awake for our stay. Liked the room , great shower and bed but would have prefered to be the other side of the hotel as the traffic noise was terrible and didnt sleep. As ive said the traffic noise spoilt the whole experience"
1719,John,2021-09-02,"Fabulous hotel. This is a lovely hotel, very well located and not far from Temple Meads station, very professional staff, room was well equipped with a great shower and a very comfortable bed and tea and coffee making facilities. Little desk to be able to work too and easy to regulate the temperature of the room to stay cool. Cannot fault any part of it, very much a thumbs up from me."
1720,Jose,2021-09-01,"Please avoid - Waffle machine for breakfast Did feel COVID-unfriendly as there was someone self-isolating in the room just in front of us and every time we entered or left our room there were leftovers in the hallway: trash, food plates, you name it. I'm unsure if that person had tested positive or not, but surely if halfway through their stay they test positive the risks for other guests is quite high? Especially given that they were allowed to receive things outside of their room door by their friends/family/whomever and we even saw the self-isolating person inside the room with an open door chatting to the person that had just brought them something. Other things that made the stay subpar: - Not in the city centre - Bathroom was *extremely* small. Two people cannot stand up in that bathroom unless one of them is inside the shower. - Ceiling painting in the bathroom was peeling off - Paid extra for garden views. The views were quite limited, and I would definitely not call that a garden - Waiters at breakfast were quite pushy to take our plates away even mid-eating. It even happened twice that they only asked if it was ok to pick our plates AFTER they had actually picked them up - 99% sure that the 'pain au chocolat' they offer for breakfast is the DIY you can buy at the supermarket were you put two cylinders of chocolate inside the dough and then oven it for 20 mins."
1721,Susan,2021-09-01,"Really enjoyed our stay here Room was big enough hot water was plentiful for your shower, brilliant breakfast very good such a wide choice to eat, all staff very friendly. Very clean throughout and staff very helpful. Just thought the food prices at night were a little expensive"
1722,Maria,2021-09-01,"Lovely 5 nights stay The breakfast at the Hilton was great. There was a selection of cereals, toast, cooked breakfast. The bar and restaurant really make this hotel. The location was ideal and walking distance to everything. I would advise to park at the Bristol Temple Quarter car park near the train station because the hotel car park was full. The restaurant manager is great and super friendly. All was great"
1723,Shellane,2021-08-30,"An okay week but could have been better. Good location, close to family and destination of occasion for travel. Very nice and quiet area, really nice staff. Easy walk into city Centre and shopping mall. Close to beautiful sights and a few good restaurants too. It would have been nice if at least breakfast was included in the price. Cost for parking is ridiculous with no consideration to the amount already paid for room. Not all buttons worked on the remote control, did not even have access to the tv guide.It being Civid times and house keeping not cleaning rooms while people are staying, supplying enough tea, coffee, toilet rolls and such for the time staying would be more convenient than having to ask each time we run out."

1726,Nicky,2021-08-28,"The bed is only suitable if you don't like comfort  - the bed was solid, it was horrible. Even the budget places soft beds. It felt horrible. - parking is a one way, narrow system. Where everyone parks everywhere. It was okay, in that we did park. So I thank that, but the system is awful"
1727,Hannah,2021-08-27,"Wouldn't recommend, unclean and loud Location was great Room wasnt very clean, hairs everywhere, bathroom/shower unclean with marks - would be disappointed with this normally, let alone during the pandemic. We had stayed at this same hotel last September and we enjoyed our stay then with no cleanliness issues, but we were really disappointed this time. Air conditioning unit was also very loud, too loud for sleeping. We switched it off part way through the night but then it had a bright green flashing light when switched off which also wasn't ideal for sleeping. Parking is very expensive, even for the area. Breakfast was overcooked. Overall wouldn't recommend."
1728,Brian,2021-08-26,"Passable It was in close proximity to train station and city centre. Also, was clean. I had upgraded to a King-size room. However, it transpired upon my asking questions to reception, that the upgrade, was just the bed size, not the room size. The bathroom was very small and compact, in fact, I could touch both sides with my arms outstretched, and the King-size bed, made the main room feel even smaller! Also, car parking at ¬£16 a day was expensive."
1729,Stacey,2021-08-24,It was ok. I did have higher expectations of the Hilton brand which unfortunately were not met The location of the hotel was good Parking was quite pricey. When I checked in I informed staff I would be keeping my car in the car park my whole stay and was told this was not going to be an issue. While out one day. I received a call from a member of staff asking me to move my car as there were tree surgeons in the car park. I said I could not as I was out and asked why I was not informed the night before. I received quite a rude response from the member of staff and raised it with reception on my return. While I received an apology it did not take away from how I felt.

It was good size TV on the room and also that there was an iron and ironing board provided in the room was something.which no other hotels I have experienced before have ever provided. . Based on where there was no room service provided whilst there it would of been better if there was a bit more coffee and tea sachets provided on the room to last longer for the period as there was no room service to top them up through out the time there .

1745,Andrew,2021-08-01,"Disappointing Location is decent. ¬£180 for a tiny room, with dated furniture, stains on the curtains, and limited room facilities. This is a hotel charging twice the price it should. I've stayed in Hilton's all over the world and it's normally a sign of quality, but here they charge quality prices but do not deliver."
1746,Nicola,2021-08-01,Fantastic Hotel Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Facilities were lovely and clean and breakfast was outstanding with plenty of choice. Great location near to St Nicholas Market and local high st shops. Plenty to do in the area The sat nav takes you to the front of the hotel where there is no entrance if travelling by car. Rear entrance is not easily found.
1747,Joel,2021-07-31,"Superb location, excellent hotel and great staff 5 mins walk from Temple Meads Station and about the same to get down to the riverside with the plethora of bars and restaurants. Check-in slightly delayed but would appear to have been a booking.com issue but soon resolved and we were in the room. We had a Queen room, nice view, very clean and tidy and the air con was nice and cool! We had a few drinks sat outside in the sun and were served superbly by Leonardo and Carla, very attentive, always looking if we needed another drink and were super quick in getting drinks as well. Leonardo has a cracking sense of humour and made the stay complete! We will be staying here again 5* Nothing, this hotel is excellent!"

1752,Emma,2021-07-28,"Great location The hotel is 7 mins walk from the station and about 15 mins from the shopping centre. The staff are super friendly and welcoming. As someone who doesn‚Äôt look well off (and I‚Äôm not!), Hilton‚Äôs are quite fancy for me so I was worried that I may get judged as I have in some places but nope, super friendly staff and they told me about their Hilton Honors programme so I could check in early (I arrived 3 hours before check in). I would highly recommend the hotel. The location is perfect (it‚Äôs next to a small park too), the staff are nice, room is clean, bed is comfy! I arrived at breakfast 30 mins after they opened and the ‚Äúhot‚Äù food was a little cold. They are kept warmed but was surprised at how cold it was considering I wasn‚Äôt there much after opening. But saying this, there is a decent amount of choices, hot food (eggs, sausages - everything for a fry up. Waffle maker, toast, yoghurt, fruit, pastries, cereal. There is also lots of drink options (coffee machine with takeaway cups), juices and water. Also (not the end of the world), but the TV didn‚Äôt have many channels but was told there would be cable TV. Also couldn‚Äôt access the TV guide so had to flick through to see what is on. It would have been helpful to have a note on channels and also how to order room service (and a menu). Overall, these cons are very minor but would be nice as improvement. I would still stay here again."
1753,Regina,2021-07-27,"Great stay We went to Hilton right after our wedding ceremony. They kindly upgraded us to a better room and gave us complementary drinks. Excellent staff and location, highly recommended!"

1755,Sarah,2021-07-25,Next time i will find a hotel with guaranteed parking and possibly no hen/stag parties staying The service at breakfast was very good and the food was also very good. Reception staff were very helpful and friendly. A softer mattress. A tv controller that worked properly (the channel guide button did not work). The noise made by the youngsters in the corridor at 3/4 am when they were returning from their evening out. Signs giving directions to hotel and car park. Not being able to park my car.

We particularly liked the stuff's behaviour and the super hygiene left when we entered in the room! Definitely worth to visit this place once in life. Maybe the parking should be increased with more tickets for visitors as it is a 4 stars hotel.
1764,Paul,2021-07-15,"Excellent all round accommodation and staff Staff all polite and friendly. Extremely helpful and went the extra bit.

The hotel is adjacent to our offices in Bristol and is my preferred location for its location, facilities and parking. The staff were outstanding from the moment I arrived till my departure. I specifically applaud the chef and restaurant staff at breakfast. As ever, all the reception and front of house staff were welcoming, unfailingly courteous and patient..

After staying in other 4* hotels in Bristol's city centre I feel this was not good value for money. The room was smaller than others I had stayed in - which is fine, but the bathroom was TINY. You didn't even have room to dry yourself after a shower! I'm also highly disappointed with the amount I had to pay for parking. For 5 days this essentially cost me an extra ¬£100. There are hotels in Bristol offering free parking so feel ripped off. Food was also disappointing, though I did only have room service on one occasion."

Astronomic car park price for one short night. Only advised of excessive charge in email 3 days prior to stay. Would have book another hotel further out if I had known at time of booking."

3003,Juliet,2024-04-30,"Hotel staff excellent, rooms comfortable but overpriced meals and drinks on top of expensive rooms. Proximity to the airport. Comfort and cleanliness of the rooms. Drinks and food overpriced. Plastic dispensers for breakfast buffet eg storing bacon etc Cooked breakfast either looked tired or lacked components"
3004,Anna,2024-04-30,Staff as helpful and pleasant as possible though Given how new the hotel is and the price I was surprised by how worn and dirty some things were.Like seating in restaurent area and chairs in room The shower was backing up the drain. It would be good given the long ramos up to the terminal for an 80 yr old to pull a suitcase for trolleys to be available at the hotelI got one the night before and brought it down - a palaver
3005,Jane-anne,2024-04-28,"Very convenient comfortable hotel perfect for the tired traveller Clean room, comfy bed and good quality sheets and towels. Spotlessly clean bathroom. Adequate room size. No complaints. Breakfast had a good choice. Staff went out of their way to assist. We were quite happy with everthing"

3011,Charlotte,2024-04-27,"Very good Really well managed hotel with good processes in place to make guests stay comfortable. The staff are the stand out attribute, clearly great training takes place and the staff were extremely helpful, and a real asset to the hotel. The breakfast could be improved significantly. The dinner menu whilst good variety, the quality of the food has room for improvement. The desk chairs in the room were sticky, I think it‚Äôs from the type of material they are made from."
3012,Betty,2024-04-26,"Our stay helped us to recharge ready for our long drive home. After a long flight during the night, the hotel was much appreciated and the member of staff that greeted us was most helpful and welcoming. Decor of our room and public areas looked dated and tired."

3020,Petr,2024-04-22,Rest before departure Fast check-in and out. Professional and helpfull staff. Room ligtning was very good. Room was clean and beds comfortamble as well as the bathroom was well equipped. Location of the hotel allowed fast access by walk to the departure hall. Thank you for a good stay. Here only to complain a bit abot the size of the room as there was not a good space between table and bed and not comfortable to sit behingd the table.
3021,Ben,2024-04-21,"My Stay at Hamption by Hilton Bristol Airport Hotel is very well located being a couple of minutes walk to the terminal. Staff was very friendly and chatty. Glad they had gym facility, can do some workout on the spin bike or treadmill. The air conditioning system wasn't working in the room I was assigned, had to swap rooms and staff was helpful to sort that issue. I didn't find the bed to comfy, didn't sleep well, it felt a bit hard, in my opinion."
3022,Allyn,2024-04-21,Overnight stay Great rooms Had to move your car after arriving after 1 hr. Right pain especially when it's raining. Needs more choice on menu

3028,Kate,2024-04-19,"Clean, convenient and comfortable. I would stay there again Clean, close to the terminal and better facilities than expected The hotel website does not make it clear that food is available in the evening or that there is a bar so we purchased an M&S picnic which wasted some time for us. You could make that more explicit on your website"
3029,Jane,2024-04-19,"We had a good sleep which was the main purpose for the stay. Very quiet rooms, very comfortable beds and exceptionally clean. The take-away breakfast was poor - very unappetising - but we had no other choice as we had an early departure from the airport."
3030,Graham,2024-04-18,Very good Ideal for its proximity to Bristol Airport for our early morning flight.

3032,Sophie,2024-04-17,"Good The close proximity to the airport Not really Worth the price paid for one night, very basic & bar very expensive"
3033,Andy,2024-04-15,Very good Breakfast was basic at 5.00am.
3034,David,2024-04-15,Adequate airport hotel Breakfast good. Bedroom carpet could have been cleaner.

Extensive selection of breakfast food and good choices of meals / snacks on other menus. Clean, comfortable room facilities. If rooms with baths are available , I prefer a bath and a shower."
3036,William,2024-04-14,"Good Situation. Room very clean and well appointed. Dinner was good. Poor selection for early risers needing to grab breakfast to go. Only croissants available. Also, room price expensive but balanced by ease of access to airport terminal."
3037,Ruth,2024-04-13,"Always clean & friendly, great breakfast Clean room, quiet and great breakfast Detour in the rain as rear entrance was closed was not appreciated in the middle of the night with luggage & child in tow!"

3039,Sarah,2024-04-11,Great location and as such you do pay a premium Location to airport A bit expensive
3040,Shane,2024-04-11,Close to airport Good breakfast Airport hotel very noisy because of lots of people leaving all time in the night and and early morning
3041,Carolyn,2024-04-11,"Superb All as expected, stayed here numerous times And always had the best service. N/a"
3042,John,2024-04-11,"Fine. As expected. Friendly staff, comfortable room, good breakfast, perfect location The price is rather high for the quality here. It is within easy walking distance of the terminal, so perhaps worth it, but it seems to me they are milking a captive audience. I f you want to stay at Bristol airport, you have to stay here, and you are paying substantially more than the quality would otherwise demand for that. The biggest other problem is that the parking situation is awful. The parking at Bristol is abysmal, and it would be really helpful if the hotel parking was at least competitive, pricewise. Going away for a three or four day business trip, you really want to be able to park at the hotel and pick up your car their upon return. At the current pricing this is not practical,"
3043,Linda,2024-04-11,Had a good stay would recommend Had a continental breakfast was very good More choice for evening meal

3045,Peter,2024-04-10,"Fit for purpose rip Not much Airport hotel, captive audience, fish in a barrel to catch early flight"
3046,Charlotte,2024-04-09,"Lovely, helpful staff, clean comfortable rooms and a great breakfast (and waffle irons!) It was nice, modern and the rooms were lovely, clean and high quality. The room was all ready for us to stay so we just came in and went straight to bed, after a long journey. The bed was quite firm, but that‚Äôs just personal preference. The air con in the room was a bit noisy, so we ended up switching it off."
3047,Ian,2024-04-09,Ok Proximity from airport Not enough milk in room
3048,Rebekah,2024-04-09,Very good Food in the evening was a decent standard would have been good if they accepted cash rather than just card.
3049,Diane,2024-04-08,Served its purpose for next day flight Everything Nothing
3050,Nele,2024-04-08,"Comfortable place to stay when arroving late or leaving early Walking distance from the terminal, very friendy staff, clean and good breakfast! No family rooms - we had to book two (adjoining) roms which makes it a little pricy."
3051,Alessio,2024-04-08,Perfect for an early-morning flight. Early breakfast (from 4.00 am) is a great idea ! Wifi was quite fast and stable. 4-minutes walk to the Airport is a great advantage. Price was a bit too high.
3052,Heidi,2024-04-08,Superb Very clean. Breakfast even at 4.30am
3053,Ian,2024-04-06,Convenient and comfortable Very convenient for the terminal. Good continental breakfast at 5 AM. Comfortable room. Quiet
3054,Alison,2024-04-06,"Lovely hotel. Great room and breakfast. Parking pricey I liked the helpful staff at reception. The room is very clean. Bedding comfortable. Tea facility good. No complaints at all. The room was also quiet which is very important to me. Great breakfast too. My only complaint is we had to pay ¬£45 for our car park in the hotel, from approximately 10 pm till 6am. I think it‚Äôs expensive tbh. Parking overnight was ¬£45 - too expensive"
3055,Catherine,2024-04-06,"Great location for an overnight stay before your flight Friendly, welcoming staff at reception. Our room was clean and comfortable. Perfect location for an overnight stay before an early morning check in. Breakfast was included."
3056,Leonie,2024-04-06,"Really good Extremely convenient for airport as on site. Very quiet too. Comfortable beds, lovely linen, pillow a bit hard for me but now I‚Äôm being fussy! I think if hadn‚Äôt got time or timing didn‚Äôt work out ,to have breakfast it would be a bit galling to have no option to not purchase breakfast as included in price."
3057,Emma,2024-04-06,"Excellent value for money for early transfers from Bristol airport Easy to find, great accessibility to Bristol airport and super friendly and informative staff"
3058,Jacqueline,2024-04-05,Very satisfactory The proximity to the airport. Clean room and given a ground floor room in view of husband‚Äôs walkingdifficulty Nothing really. All was as expected
3059,Dainis,2024-04-05,"Good but expensive option for connection flight for one night. Really close to airport (by walk 3-5 min under roof, it was raining so it helps). Little gym, but nothing to see around. We stay just for overnight and this was ok. Breakfast could be better for this money (we paid 200 eur per night)."
3060,Sales,2024-04-05,Very good  Poor Food Selection
3061,Emma,2024-04-04,"Clean ,comfortable and pleasant Breakfast buffet at 4 in the morning was excellent i I wasn't expecting anything to be open that time,considering we had to be at the the airport at 5 room was clean&comfortable Nothing really but if anything woukd like to see a bit more on the dinner menu as not many options"
3062,Jon,2024-04-04,"Great staff and location, room lovely and clean. Uncomfortable pillows made for restless night. Staff were lovely. Location is brilliant, food and drink were great. We found the pillows very uncomfortable, so didn‚Äôt sleep very well."
3063,Angela,2024-04-04,"Good value and great location Check in was fast and good, staff gave all info we needed. room was clean and comfortable. beds very comfortable. morning call was offered. breakfast has plenty of options. no shuttle to the terminal if the weather is bad, works affected the pathway to the hotel"
3064,Indigo_01,2024-04-04,"Very good Stylish, friendly and convenient. Can be a bit noisy still at night due to location."
3065,Hunter,2024-04-03,Superb Ideal location Friendly and professional staff Would recommend
3066,Chris,2024-04-02,"Best airport hotel ever üòä Great location, smart clean rooms and amazing staff! All good üëç"
3067,Lorna,2024-04-02,an ideal location when travelling from Bristol airport Nice welcome near midnight and a barman still able to let us buy a whisky... After a long day's travelling. A clean and comfortable room with air con/heating that was responsive. Satisfactory breakfast There wasn't anything
3068,Chris,2024-04-02,Very good Closeness to the airport Finding out that the parking at the hotel was ¬£45 for a night when I was already booked in to the next door multi storey for the following day. I could have just added an extra day to the parking in the multi storey.
3069,Gareth,2024-04-02,Convenient but facilities poor Location and convenience to terminal The bar options and restaurant menu Seating quality in bar/restaurant
3070,Pauline,2024-04-01,Superb Rooms good & breakfast good The performance to pay to get a drink at the bar. Seemed crazy bar staff couldn't take payment and had to go to reception to set a tab up. Price for it was a bit steep as well.
3071,Barbara,2024-03-31,"Great location but painfully expensive for the time I was there. Brand new hotel, nice room, 3 minute walk to airport so perfectly located. The price!!!! You really do have to pay through the nose for the convenience of being right by the airport. But it's not like anyone will be staying for anything other than hours. It would be good if they had a different ptrice structure so that you could rent the room for 12 hours ."
3072,Amber,2024-03-30,"Friendly staff, clean spacious rooms, clarity on suites needed We loved the checking in experience - Cameron was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious, clean and as expected (we booked adjoining interconnected rooms as a family suite). The only issue was the inability to specify that we wanted one room as a,twin instead of a double. We had hoped to put the children in a twin room but instead had to do one parent one child per double bed, which didn't result in great sleep for anyone."
3073,Lauren,2024-03-30,"Perfect for before an early flight Cameron who checked us in was professional and polite, had a lovely friendly manner as he chatted to my family. Breakfast had a good selection All okay"
3074,Janet,2024-03-30,"Easily accessible to the airport, clean and tidy hotel The flight was to early to have breakfast A bit costly"
3075,Barbara,2024-03-30,Couldn't be better under the circumstances of our travel. Friendly and helpful staff. Easy checking in even though we arrived late. Decent breakfast & comfortable room to fall into when arriving exhausted. Thank you. The common seating area could have been better cleaned.
3076,Brian,2024-03-29,"Short but sweet. The first time we stayed at this location, very convenient as our arrival was late. We were impressed. The room was very loved the bed and shower. The breakfast was nice. No decaffeinated coffee in the room."
3077,Brownj13,2024-03-29,"Comfortable, clean and friendly friendly and very central No issues"
3078,Lyn,2024-03-29,handy for the airport so handy for the airport - we dragged off a late flight into the hotel in minutes to catch up with our sleep. The nightime staff on reception were lovely. we weren't sure whether we could eat late so bought sandwiches in the airport before coming over. breakfast is served until 10 - a little later would be helpful given the comings and goings of people using this type of hotel (& the price)
3079,Carl,2024-03-29,Very good So close to airport room and food was great
3080,Gary,2024-03-29,"Excellent location the hotel cleanliness was excellent Location, cleanliness, the room, and food was great. I would certainly use this hotel again. Nothing"
3081,Christopher,2024-03-29,"Ideal for our purposes would be happy to stay there again if flying from Bristol Airport. Very friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast selection even very early in the morning. The room was clean and had everything we needed for our short stay. Proximity to Bristol airport was ideal. Being unable to pay cash for drinks and food."
3082,Stephanie,2024-03-28,Ideal for airport Location excellent. Always clean and comfortable. Lovely quality toiletries and spacious shower with shower head not fixed which is great for washing hair without drowning. Varied buffet breakfast. Dinner available in the evening fortunately as nothing else around and fair price at around ¬£15 for a main. Nice wine stocked too üòÇ One odd thing. The bathroom sink is set quite far back in its surround. Have to lean quite far in which is a bit uncomfortable. Be nice to have a magnifying mirror if possible one day.
3083,Andrea,2024-03-27,Well worth taking the stress out of an early flight Perfect
3084,June,2024-03-26,Comfortable hotel marred by parking charge Disgusting price for parking unexplained in website. Would never book again ¬£60 to park in a hotel car park!!!! Rip off parking could never recommend hotel to others
3085,Peter,2024-03-25,"very good, convenient, evening meal disappointing room breakfast evening meal"
3086,Robert,2024-03-25,Convenient stay when flying Very convenient next to the airport when having an early flight. Room was tidy and had everything needed for a one night stay. Quiet and quite comfy beds. The staff at reception the were very pleasant. The breakfast. Ok it is a part of the price you pay when you stay (we paid ¬£154 for one night) but compared to other hotels who offer this I would expect a bit better quality when paying that amount per night. Everything seemed very unhealthily greasy especially the hash browns!
3087,Paul,2024-03-23,Very good Proximity to terminal. All good. The bed
3088,Sean,2024-03-23,"Very relaxing - perfect way to start our holiday Room was quiet, bed very comfortable. Did not have breakfast due to early flight, but had a drink and meal in the bar the previous evening. Drinks and meals were lovely."
3089,James,2024-03-22,"Superb Strategic position, very friendly staff and spacious room with everything you may need. Quite expensive obviously because it‚Äôs literally next to the terminal. What I found ridiculous is the 45 ¬£ parking fee for a hotel guest that arrives at 21.00 and leaves at 08.00. That is a total rip-off, the rest is fair overall, including the restaurant and bar (not bad at all)"
3090,Sharon,2024-03-22,Good WE had an early flight so it took the pressure off in the morning as it's a short walk through to the terminal. Basic but good. Food was OK so it was fine for what we needed. Fine for what we needed
3091,Ian,2024-03-22,"Have been previously, and the price has increased, but not the eating experience. The room was fine. The food was overpriced. Chairs somewhat uncomfortable for eating. Lower prices for the standard received."
3092,Madeleine,2024-03-22,Very good Location is very convenient for late arrivals/ early departures. Lovely buffet breakfast A little pricey. The receptionist told us to go to the short stay carpark to get an Uber but Uber told us that we could have waited in the warm hotel as they come in and validate the hotel car park ticket :(
3093,Boothman,2024-03-21,Good We liked the proximity to the airport. Drinks were reasonable prices and good quality drinks. Very friendly staff. Carole and the younger lad behind the bar. Sorry I didn't catch your name. We had a wake up call too as we had an early flight. Also breakfast was served from 4 am which was perfect to grab some coffee before we left. The bar / lounge area wasn't very warm. The food wasn't the best. I only had a toasted sandwich.
3094,Amy,2024-03-21,Easy airport access perfect for young families Perfect location to stay with our toddler before an earlier flight. Breakfast was easy to access and staff were brilliant.
3095,Mary,2024-03-20,"Very good Location , comfortable bed, good shower , well maintained,service was efficient and it ticked all the boxes for catering."
3096,Louise,2024-03-20,"Comfortable hotel to stay in if arriving late, or leaving from the airport early. The location next to the airport was very convenient. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The toom was totally silent so the soundproofing was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The noticeboard for the flights was very useful. The television had no access to Netflix or other apps which was a bit frustrating. The reception and dining area felt chilly, and the decor was too grey and uniform."
3097,Burdett,2024-03-19,Very good Close to airport. Breakfast was good. Room was ideal. Cost of parking
3098,Perkins,2024-03-19,Excellent The staff were very friendly Nothing came to mind
3099,Alessandra,2024-03-18,This is a very good location near the airport I liked the croissants and coffee
3100,Colin,2024-03-18,"Very good Well designed and comfortable room, bed and shower room. Close to the airport so very convenient for our trip to and from M√°laga The lunchtime food menu was not good and very little choice for people with allergies. Very expensive also."
3101,Ian,2024-03-18,Superb Location Breakfast Room
3102,Suzanne,2024-03-18,Very good  Unable to open a window due to building work
3103,Josephine,2024-03-18,"First stay, so pleased with the location and accommodation. Clean, modern, comfortable bed, lovely bathroom. Very short, easy walk from departures/arrivals Nothing, perfect for an airport stay"
3104,Kelly,2024-03-17,"Good Staff very friendly with my daughter Food was awful, cheesy chips must of been done in a microwave they were all congealed together, daughter had mac and cheese that had grease running off it"
3105,Caroline,2024-03-17,Airport stopover Perfect location for overnight stay at airport
3106,Brian,2024-03-16,"Have stayed a few times now and always find it comfortable and qiet in roowish we could book direct. Liked room, staff, breakfast. Usually get better price NOT booking direct. Would like better choice for meals and perhaps better presented. Walk from Terminal so far at present (realise the building going on) especially at our age (Seniors) but got assistance to Terminal when leaving."
3107,Bethaney,2024-03-15,"Lovely rooms - eat before you arrive Lovely room, nice clean and comfortable. The staff member who checked us in was lovely. Very close to the airport making it very easy for our 7am flight, expensive for a nights stay however for the convenience it was worth the price. The food. Very expensive poor quality food, had I known it would be the case we probably would have eaten before arrival. ¬£40 for 2 Pepsis, 1 panini and a very tasteless chicken korma. I wouldn‚Äôt mind the price had the food been good. The young girl on the bar I dealt with was also quite rude, when I asked if I could pay cash she literally laughed in my face and said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs literally a sign right there that says card only‚Äù pointing at it. The smallest printed sign on front of the till, no mention of it on the menus. Rooms great, food definitely needs improvement."
3108,Judith,2024-03-15,"Great hotel and great food We have stayed here since it opened , it has a lovely atmosphere It has gone up in price quite a bit"
3109,Jane,2024-03-15,Apart from the works - perfect - staying again! Proximity to airport Unfortunately major works meant a walk around the road which lugging a heavy case was not ideal. Still not far but not ideal when it says its a two minute walk to the airport and in fact maybe six - in the rain!
3110,Michael,2024-03-13,"Nice accommodation, poor food The location of course, right next to the airport We‚Äôve stayed at this hotel several times and the big thing that lets it down every single time is the poor quality of the food. It really is not good. Considering the price of the hotel, it should be much better."
3111,Ann,2024-03-13,Very convenient and glad of early breakfast Location for airport was reason for booking Bath in room
3112,Margaret,2024-03-13,Excellent location for flights with very nice clean and comfortable rooms Clean - location - excellent bed - very nice bathroom - staff were helpful The breakfast breads could be a bit more varied. It‚Äôs a solid but not exciting breakfast
3113,Kim,2024-03-12,"Would recommend. Had very early flight, so convenient. Very comfortable and easy check-in/out. There is no undercover walkway and it was raining, arriving and leaving!"
3114,Duane,2024-03-12,Superb easy walk to airport price
3115,Ian,2024-03-12,Pretty well as expected Most of it Supper
3116,Lorraine,2024-03-11,Very good Good hotel and team Dragging bags around due to airport works
3117,Ann,2024-03-11,Very convenient for airport not sure if I‚Äôd stay Convenient location. Nice rooms Check in took nearly an hour even with a booking confirmation and was very a stressful process. Staff were quite vacant and service was extremely slow even though it was not that busy. Rooms were very nice but reception area was like a departure lounge. Strange post office style queuing system by the bar. Very expensive.
3118,Jacqueline,2024-03-10,Room styling exceeded expectations. Shower excellent. Lots of pillows. Location good. Would have preferred muesli to cornflakes. Cereal selection
3119,Matthew,2024-03-10,A perfect way to start your holiday. Very close to terminal; clean and comfortable. And no aircraft noise. Exceptionally clean. Very helpful and friendly staff. Maybe a packet of biscuits on the room would be nice.
3120,Alan,2024-03-10,"Complete the covered walk to the terminal and this would be great improvement on a very nice hotel. Very comfortable room, cleanliness excellent, staff friendly and helpfull, although some of the reception staff seemed a little inexperienced. Location very good. Meals (breakfast and dinner) satisfactory. The sliding door on the toilet/shower room (there would have been room for a conventional hinged door). On opening the door to the toilet, it covered the wardrobe access. A big problem was the lack of a full covered walkway to the airport terminal. Only about one third was covered and we were soaked after the 2-3 minute walk."
3121,Gillian,2024-03-10,Would book again Free breakfast was good. Sadly on the outward journey early banging from building works
3122,Philip,2024-03-09,Good Checked in and was given a key to a room already occupied. Complained and got a free dinner. Went to the bar later and paid ¬£15!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for a large scotch. The price of a large scotch
3123,Helen,2024-03-09,"Very handy for the terminal building Convenient, clean & good facilities Expensive"
3124,Ian,2024-03-09,Good Excellent and friendly staff Evening meals are basic but that's probably fine for an airport hotel.
3125,Barbara,2024-03-08,Good location Location Long walk from the hotel to the airport pushing a heavy suitcase. Please install a more direct route so people do not have to walk all the way around the car park.
3126,Roy,2024-03-07,Overall very good. Room Staff Shower drain seemed to be partially blocked
3127,Svitlana,2024-03-06,Comfortable and quiet hotel in convenient location Despite being so close to the airport it was very quiet in the room . Comfortable beds so had a good few hours sleep before our flight . Early breakfast . A bit pricey for one night stay .
3128,Nick,2024-03-06,Good Location Cooked breakfast is poor quality
3129,J,2024-03-06,Good and would use this hotel again when next in Bristol Great Location and lovely room Nothing
3130,Ann,2024-03-05,"Comfortable overnight stay in perfect airport location Location, comfort, and professional and friendly staff. Breakfast - vegetarian sausages were horrible. Linda McCartney or Richmond meatless sausages are far superior and inexpensive. No soya milk."
3131,Margaret,2024-03-05,Very comfortable well located hotel. Well situated for early morning start. Modern well equipped comfortable room Bit pricey
3132,Ian,2024-03-04,Superb Breakfast Room Atmosphere in bar Proximity to Bristol Airport terminal building
3133,Ruth,2024-03-04,Very good Convenience to departures. Nice breakfast from very early. Clean quiet room Nil
3134,Byron,2024-03-04,Value for money hotel located close to airport Hotel was very clean and all staff I spoke with professional & friendly Due to the on going building works the walk to the hotel from airport following the directions along the road was much longer than expected and would suggest difficult for older travellers. Cash not being excepted to pay for food and drinks was a surprise.
3135,Blin,2024-03-03,Very good all
3136,Andrea,2024-03-03,Good location Location for airport. Asked for a lower room as don't use lifts and was offered an easy access room. The room turned out to be a fully disabled room which had a very clinical smell and having stayed here before was not up to the normal standard. Arrived late and decided to have a drink in the bar but sadly none of the tables had been cleaned. The staff were removing glasses from tables and leaving notices on them asking people to bear with them until they wiped the tables Couldn't really understand why this couldn't be done at the time of clearing
3137,Lisa,2024-03-03,Really good. Proximity to airport. Comfortable Good facilities The bar seemed slow and badly organised
3138,Jan,2024-03-02,Ok Close to airport Very poor menu
3139,Maria,2024-03-02,Ok Its convenient for the airport Price a bit high. And a glass of wine is costly
3140,Angela,2024-02-29,Very good On the airport. Decent breakfast. Staff helpful and friendly. Bed quite hard. Room was cold on arrival and heating had been turned up high to get it warm but then would be too hot - the temperature on the thermostat did not seem to be working properly. Shower not very hot.
3141,Jill,2024-02-29,Ok Location Restaurant?
3142,John,2024-02-29,Ok Modern and clean Uncovered access from airport to hotel
3143,Peter,2024-02-28,Good for travellers using the airport Early breakfast from 4am with hot breakfast from 6pm. Limited choice of menu for evening meal. Thought hotel price was a bit high.
3144,Neal,2024-02-27,"Brilliant airport location Excellent stop over for flight from Bristol. Continental breakfast was fine for a very early flight. Very quiet, clean and comfortable. Staff very helpful."
3145,Julia,2024-02-27,Great peace of mind & relaxing start when taking an early flight. Great choice of breakfast at very early time With the problem of access to hotel currently limited to door from carpark only. When you have a heavy suitcase & you are over 65 there should be some sort of shuttle offered to reach airport . It‚Äôs a steeper & longer climb than from the front door.
3146,Beverley,2024-02-26,Breakfast fruit was off. Surfaces in the bedroom had not been wiped properly. Staff were excellent. Still feels new. Reasonably well maintained. Location
3147,Aneeta,2024-02-26,Fab stay as rooms were great. Great beds and pillows were comfortable. Food was great and beds were super comfortable.
3148,Sarah,2024-02-25,"Very pleasant airport hotel Staff were extremely helpful, very comfortable generally, Breakfast was good and it was all surprisingly nice for an airport hotel. Evening food prices were reasonable. Evening food was ok but not oustanding."
3149,Rosalind,2024-02-25,Served the purpose after a late flight arrival Convenience; quiet
3150,Paul,2024-02-25,"Friendly staff, clean room and good breakfast Breakfast was excellent. Only having one comfy chair in the bedroom"
3151,Michael,2024-02-25,Convenient (usually) and comfortable Everything No shuttle service to the airport terminal which is more important during the building works as the walkway is closed. Took us 20minutes pushing 3 suitcases up a long hill in the rain at 4am
3152,Gerard,2024-02-24,Clean comfortable hotel close to airport. Staff very attentive. Close to airport
3153,Ana,2024-02-23,Very good It is just next to the terminal !! Very handy !! Very comfy travelling with children !!!
3154,Chris,2024-02-23,"Great for early starts at the airport! Friendly staff, great location and quiet rooms despite proximity to the airport Food selection was fairly limited, and also a little utilitarian"
3155,Katherine,2024-02-23,"The best option for overnight at Bristol airports Easy to reach from the airport, very clean and well equipped room ."
3156,Sandra,2024-02-22,Good Convenient for airport. Evening food was not good with a very processed limited menu.
3157,Andrew,2024-02-22,Easy access to airport Easy access to airport Lucily we had parking already in the Airport as it was ¬£55 per night at the hotel Road works made access not so easy
3158,Richard,2024-02-22,Very good Ideal for early morning flight A long walk due to building work around hotel
3159,Vicki,2024-02-21,Very good Location Very cold
3160,Eileen,2024-02-21,Early flight so good to have a nice room and breakfast. Good sized room Bathroom door did not close properly.
3161,Tracey,2024-02-21,Great location for the airport but disappointed at the additional parking charges The location The outrageous parking charge!
3162,Debbie,2024-02-21,Perfect Perfect location for travelling from the airport Nothing
3163,Jon,2024-02-21,Convenient and suitable for a short rest between flights Quiet and comfortable room
3164,Merilyn,2024-02-21,"So so convenient for an early bird flight. I travel to Jerez de la Frontera regularly to do flamenco classes with teachers there. Not exactly leisure nor work. It‚Äôs a long journey and to save time and money I invariable catch a very early flight. I can then travel on from Malaga to Seville and then Jerez. The hotel stay makes that possible and I can leave the car in the Silvee parking and go to bed in comfort. The breakfast in the morning is a bit grundgy - but I do have a particular diet (no dairy milk, no factory bread, only organic). It is included with the price though. This time we had to take a long detour walking to avoid building work. Never mind all wirth it. The staff are great. The rooms excellent."
3165,Stroud,2024-02-21,"Overall worth booking if you‚Äôve got an early flight. Good facilities and no noise considering so close to airport. Very clean, great staff. Convenient for airport Quite expensive."
3166,Kim,2024-02-20,On the whole ok for one night breakfast was very good Very clean and beds very comfortable Very disappointed with the evening meal from restaurant. Jacket potato was rotten on the inside on one meal and lettuce stale and brown on the other meal both had to be sent back and changed
3167,Mike,2024-02-20,Superb Location and modern styling of the decor
3168,Kerry,2024-02-20,Convenient for Bristol Airport. This is a convenient hotel for the airport. The rooms were good. They were quiet and the beds were comfy. The shower was good. Handy to get food and drinks in the hotel. Free breakfast. It will be better when the building work is completed so you're closer to the airport and don't have the slope. It is quite expensive. We didn't get breakfast as were leaving extremely early so would prefer to not have to pay for it.
3169,David,2024-02-20,Superb Very comfortable room breakfast was excellent for early departure of our flight Not really anything
3170,Julie,2024-02-20,Great value with complimentary breakfast Excellent proximity to the airport Not the hotels fault but building work being done started at 8am so early wake up call after a late flight
3171,Sutherland,2024-02-19,"Comfortable, good breakfast. Clean and comfortable Expensive for what it is, not great value for money. Probably because it‚Äôs near an airport"
3172,Jeffrey,2024-02-19,We enjoyed the stay although I thought we could have parked there as we on stayed there that night as a result of me goi The property was good The property was good and we would stay again
3173,Sean,2024-02-19,"A review Bed was comfy, staff where nice and friendly. The food was nice."
3174,Andrew,2024-02-19,"A lot of money for a couple of hours sleep.otherwise excellent location and staff Location Parking Technology failed getting in and out, had to sit and wait. Had to pay for breakfast, we were unable to have due to flight time. There should have been a reduction. We got drenched getting to airport as walk way closed, not sure why, from hotel to other carport did not effect hotel."
3175,Patricia,2024-02-18,"Great. Will stay again. Location, breakfast starts at 4am this is perfect. Great facilities. 5 minutes walking distance from airport. Staff not very friendly."
3176,Mike,2024-02-18,"Ok, functional. Couldn't have cooked breakfast because I had to leave at5.30 ok. Evening meal."
3177,Stephen,2024-02-18,"Great location and friendly staff, comfortable quiet room. Really like this hotel, great location and really good staff - friendly and helpful. Nice, quiet room, comfortable bed, slept well. The dinner food was not very good and expensive for what it was. We got absolutely soaked walking round the pedestrian diversion around the work on the extension."
3178,Andrew,2024-02-18,Would stay again Access to airport Expensive for one night no pRking
3179,Linda,2024-02-17,Very good Within walking distance to airport
3180,Tina,2024-02-17,"Ideal for what we Needed , wish we could of stayed a bit longer to enjoy Hotel More . So Close to Airport will Definitely be Booking again when we Travel , Very Clean , Didn‚Äôt have Time for Breakfast as we Traveled Easy wax offered a Continental Breakfast but was Booked into Lounge at Airport so can‚Äôt Comment on That , Made out Travel a Delight üòÄ Very Friendly , Close to Airport"

3188,Victor,2024-02-14,Good location nice hotel Location and nice room The entrance from the bus was closed so I had to walk completely around the hotel. Also could not get a VAT receipt even though Booking. Com said air could get a receipt if I asked for it at reception. Reception said they could not issue one and I had to ask Bookjng.com
3189,Alfred,2024-02-14,"A lovely stay in a very comfortable and convenient hotel Breakfast and previous evening meal were excellent. Room nice as was the ensuite Location slightly spoiled by the sink hole closing the shortcut to / from the airport - particularly Shan I walked the long detour to the hotel, in the dark,not knowing where I was going. It was both tiring and a little scary. Had I known beforehand - eg by text - then I could have planned"
3190,Andrea,2024-02-13,"Clean and comfortable, will use again. Clean and comfortable, staff were friendly Bit of a palaver getting into airport with the building works that are happening, I am not very mobile so it was a bit of a slog. Very long hair on one of the plates our food came on."
3191,Chris,2024-02-13,Great for convenience It was conveniently situated Its facilities were typical of a transit hotel
3192,Toby,2024-02-13,Superb Great hotel when making an eaeyl flight or arriving home late. It's just outside the terminal. The footpath was closed this stay so had a walk around the car park to get to terminal but not a big issue.
3193,Heather,2024-02-12,Good 2 large single beds with generous duvets. Toiletries provided. Self service breakfast ok. Room was cool and heating did not help. Only 1 hook in bathroom for clothes or damp bath towels. Construction work going on outside the wing we were in. Drilling started at 8am
3194,Susan,2024-02-12,Very good Breakfast Room was freezing when we arrived. Took us a couple of hours to warm up
3195,Cazzaj16,2024-02-12,Superb Staff were very friendly on check-in and check-out. Can't hear anything from outside within the rooms so was very quiet (we were not airport side). Breakfast was lovely and bed super clean with a nice mattress Pillows too soft but that's just my preference. Cutlery for breakfast had water stains and hadn't been polished
3196,Christine,2024-02-11,It was perfect for our necessity to be near to the airport Convenient
3197,Leanne,2024-02-11,Good Lovely and clean That‚Äôs the side entrance was closed and we had to walk all the way around in the pouring down rain was soaked when we got to airport would have been nice to be told this
3198,Anne,2024-02-11,"Very good Convenient, clean and spacious. Lovely bedroom and bathroom. It was all good"
3199,Geogiana,2024-02-10,"Great hotel, great location, best hotel to start a holiday, definitely recommend it Location, cleanliness, staff, services The sofa bed was not perfectly comfortable"
3200,Esm√©,2024-02-09,Superb Convenient for early morning flight check-in. No warning that hotel footpath was deviated from the terminal due to ongoing works and in pouring rain arrived wet and with wet luggage.
3201,Carl,2024-02-09,"Very enjoyable, would definitely recommend to others. Breakfast was very good, evening meal also very good, staff excellent."
3202,Roderick,2024-02-09,Good Clean comfy bed. Menu choice. Poor access to terminal - use of transport was helpful. Poor ventilation options. AC noisy
3203,Linda,2024-02-08,"Clean and comfortable, and very close to airport. Good location, within walking distance of the airport All good"
3204,Gwyneth,2024-02-08,Just ok. Proximity to airport. Breakfast. Complications with reception. Parking charges. Lack of cosy atmosphere.
3205,Sheila,2024-02-08,A really good place to stay if you have an early flight Proximity to the airport. Helpful staff. Comfortable room. Very good breakfast even at 4am The bar menu food was not great. No/one in our party was really impressed with what they ordered. My cheese sandwich has such a this slice of cheese in it you could barely taste it. Bar area was also a little chilly.
3206,Migueljk,2024-02-08,Comfortable and relaxing All round great stay. Nothing to dislike
3207,Paul,2024-02-07,"Excellent choice for stop over before flying out of Bristol Airport or when returning. Well organised and good food for the type of hotel. Dinner ends at 10pm so a bit disappointing if you have a late flight we arrived at just after 10pm and dinner was finished. However, they do offer a room service with a limited menu."
3208,Godelieve,2024-02-07,"Staying there again for comfort and hope the restaurant will improve Cleanliness, comfort, very comfortable bed and pillows, quiet and a walk away from the terminals The food is not to the standard of the hotel at all. Very disappointing."
3209,Simon,2024-02-07,"Great way to start your holiday Great location, friendly and helpful team üëç"
3210,Nicola,2024-02-06,Very good Location Tap water in the toilette smelled funny. I forgot to report to the reception
3211,Sue,2024-02-06,Very comfortable staff were all very nice Very close to airport for that early morning flight Nothing it was great
3212,Robert,2024-02-06,"Very good Room size, good desk area, good wifi"
3213,Lesley,2024-02-06,Adequate for a night before a flight The room was clean and comfortable The price
3214,Rupert,2024-02-06,"Okay The beds very comfortable, good location for airport and excellent shower in bathroom Breakfast very poor, no choice of which way you like your eggs done and no black pudding"
3215,Martin,2024-02-05,"Great for overnight stay before early flights Friendly staff, directly next to the terminal, great food in the bar restaurant, early morning continental breakfast A bit more choice on the bar menu would be nice..."
3216,Anthony,2024-02-04,"Perfect o/n stop before the flight Very good clean rooms, everything required for o/n stay. Really close to airport, handy. All good"
3217,Julie,2024-02-04,1 night preflight Clean comfy beds close airport. Food poor qualiity ..room small as i paid extra queen..but more like a double..very expensive overall
3218,Robert,2024-02-02,"Great location - but park in Silver Zone not in the hotel car park! Excellent location, walking distance from airport Very expensive parking. In the end I parked in Silver Zone 12 hours early and paid them an extra ¬£15 instead of the overnight ¬£45 quoted by the hotel."
3219,Chris,2024-02-01,It was ok VERY CLOSE TO AIRPORT FOOD WASNT ALL THAT NICE AND IT WAS EXPENSIVE
3220,Paula,2024-02-01,It was very convenient it was a bit pricey Very close to airport It was cold in our room and thermostat want working
3221,Martin,2024-01-31,"Clean, comfortable and convenient. I liked the toast in the morning. Bed was comfortable and shower facilities were good. Was expensive for a solo traveller."
3222,Lynne,2024-01-31,Excellent choice for easy early morning flight. Close proximity to multi storey car park and airport building. One hour free parking for check in and luggage drop. Friendly helpful staff. Good evening meal. Early continental breakfast buffet excellent!
3223,Nigel,2024-01-30,"all good thanks - just what we needed proximity to the airport good breakfast included direct access from the airport. the access was closed due to ""weather problems""!"
3224,Philip,2024-01-30,"Convenient and comfortable hotel. Brilliant location for access to terminal buildings. Excellent sound proofing - considering it is at an airport, there was no exterior noise at all."
3225,Samantha,2024-01-30,Very convenient and while not cheap was worth it for the early start and the staff were very lovely A really big room which was great as we had ski bags and large suitcases. Everything was clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Plus breakfast started at 4.30 so we managed to eat something before our early flight. I didn‚Äôt realise it was included in the price! Work by Bristol airport meant we couldn‚Äôt walk as easily as usual to the terminal but that was not the hotels fault. Trolleys for luggage would have helped
3226,Angela,2024-01-29,Very good Very clean - great proximity to airport Nothing
3227,Wendy,2024-01-29,Definitely stay again. Left too early Small niggles...TV unplugged and socket hidden. No decaf coffee. No non dairy milk in room.
3228,Iryna,2024-01-29,Very good  There are no connectors for charging gadgets. Add to number. thank you
3229,Michel,2024-01-28,Very good  Room wa a bit cold
3230,Ceri-ann,2024-01-28,Superb Good food. Nice and quiet. Walk to the terminal. It was expensive for one night.
3231,Jackie,2024-01-27,"Good  We had the burger and chips and it's the worst burger I have ever had totally tasteless, shame on you hampton by hilton"
3232,Stewart,2024-01-26,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
3233,Colin,2024-01-26,Superb location to airport and breakfast all good
3234,Martin,2024-01-25,"Superb The bar staff working on the 24th were excellent, polite and efficient, even though they struggled opening a new bottle of rum. The good was served quickly and was just the right amount."
3235,Mary,2024-01-25,"Last minute booking Last minute booking in airport hotel The bed was very comfortable and a good size. The staff were efficient and welcoming. It was a filthy wet night so understandably wet leaves had been brought in on people's shoes, but they were still there in the morning. No vegan/ vegetarian options for breakfast"
3236,Lynda,2024-01-25,"Very good Nice clean,polite man on reception, although breakfast was continental was pleased with it Giving me a room that wasn't cleaned and tv chanel were poor for a English hotel when I got the second room was satisfied"
3237,Steve,2024-01-25,Family night stop over It‚Äôs always great to stay here the night before travelling The staff are always amazing And the food and facilities are pretty good also No waffle machine
3238,Sta,2024-01-25,Quiet & convenient Great location for access to the airport. The room was quiet & clean. Breakfast options were good.
3239,Ray,2024-01-25,"Served a purpose. Breakfast was well organised and delivered. Nice. Exit to airport terminal closed. Restaurant was disappointing, limited choice, but chosen meal acceptable. Side order forgotten."
3240,Jenny,2024-01-24,"Absolutely fine and the croissant were really good The hotel is clean and comfortable. Croissant at breakfast were good. The rooms are comfortable. The price I think is high for what is basically a upmarket Premier Inn. However, it is the only hotel by the airport so I can fully appreciate why there is a premium. We chose to pay the price as my husband had an early flight and we wanted to be as close as possible to the airport. We could have stayed at the Clifton Gorge Hotel Du Vin for the same price which would have been much more of a 'special' stay but as we basically just wanted a bed for the night this was fine. It is a hotel that offers what it says it will do. The staff member I dealt with at check-in was very friendly and helpful. Very small thing but I was surprised that there was only standard tea or coffee sachets in the room. I would have liked a green/peppermint/ or something similar before going to bed."
3241,Paul,2024-01-23,"Very convenient to Bristol airport, excellent location, great facilities and great people. Great location and spotlessly clean Very little to dislike, it was perfect for our overnight stay before travelling on."
3242,Tom,2024-01-22,Perfect for an early flight. Perfect for an early morning flight Nothing
3243,Marta,2024-01-21,"Fantastic option if you need to take an early flight The location couldn't be better if you need to take an early flight in the morning. It's right next to the airport. I have stayed in this hotel twice and both times the rooms were very nice and comfortable. I find the price quite expensive, considering that both times I booked was to be able to take an early flight in the morning, so I didn't feel like I had much time to enjoy the rooms or the complimentary breakfast."
3244,Neil,2024-01-21,"Superb Close to the airport, clean, nice big beds"
3245,James,2024-01-21,"comfortable and very convenient for airport--walkable. good breakfast, comfortable room, very convenient to airport choice of food in evening not very inspiring."
3246,Raymond,2024-01-21,Good hotel but as with all airport hotels slightly over priced Great location 5 min walk from terminal Food was very average
3247,Jane,2024-01-20,"Good hotel, ridiculous overnight car park charge Extremely convenient for early morning flight out of Bristol airport The new car park charge which was an eye watering ¬£45 overnight! Even though we booked before this came in it was still applied. Would not stay there again for this reason"
3248,Martyn,2024-01-19,"It's ideal to fly. Food fine but self service. Great breakfast. Rather expensive. This is an airport hotel in a great position. Food was fine. It does the job. It was quite expensive because its onsite. You get up and walk to the terminal. Self srevice in an expensive hotel. Got to get up and queue every time yiou or anyone in your party wats another course or drink. It does the job but its not part of the holiday,"
3249,Richard,2024-01-19,Splendid Very convenient for Bristol Airport Nothing I can think of
3250,Tracey,2024-01-18,Very convenient for Airport Close to the airport Ideal for early flight Staff very friendly and helpful Had lots of puzzles and books with crayons for children which was great as I was with my 2 year old granddaughter Arrived at 7pm Really busy in the restaurant seemed short staffed and lots of food not available So had to settle for a pizza
3251,David,2024-01-17,Good Ok Facility outside the Hotel getting to the airport
3252,Michelle,2024-01-17,Superb very helpful lady on reception - apologies i didn't get her name
3253,Clive,2024-01-16,"Very good Breakfast good but would have liked hot option, we were too early.needed h Needed hot option for breakfast the only thing we were unhappy with but it would not stop us staying again.convenient for flight comfortable room ."
3254,Yvonne,2024-01-15,"Very good  Could do with better parking facilities, perhaps the option to leave and pick up on return if on the same day"
3255,Shepherd,2024-01-15,"Very good Location to airport, clean and comfy Too expensive room rate , no fried eggs at breakfast"
3256,Merilyn,2024-01-15,Decent food and very convenient for air travel. It is SO convenient for early flights from Bristol airport.
3257,Michelle,2024-01-15,Lovely stay nice staff We were going in our honeymoon the next day so the location is very good also staff were very friendly gave us a drink vouchers because we were on our honeymoon Al thou the food was ok think there could be more choice
3258,Alison,2024-01-14,"Overall good, staff a little inexperienced and offish upon first communication Location Nothing"
3259,Ian,2024-01-14,"Ian's stay at Hampton. The hotel was conveniently situated next to the airport, for an early flight to Paris. The shower and bathroom were excellent, and the bedroom was very comfortable. Nothing to report."
3260,Saj,2024-01-14,Staff were friendly and polite. We cannot fault them. Hotel was clean & tidy. I just felt it was all about the money The property was clean & tidy. I felt it was all about the money e.g when I ordered a glass of Prosecco and they took their time because they had to do the exact measurement for it.
3261,Niall,2024-01-13,"Very good Very convenient to the airport Very expensive parking. Not the hotels fault, I believe the rate is set by the Airport"
3262,Gary,2024-01-13,Ok Location Staff not attentive
3263,Sarah,2024-01-13,Very good Breakfast excellent You wouldn't take cash
3264,William,2024-01-13,Made getting to airport less stressful as could get uplater Very good everything near and accessible Nothing
3265,Edwina,2024-01-11,Overnight stay before early flight Great location for early flight.comfortable room and beds.
3266,Gary,2024-01-11,Very good  Evening meal could have been so much better
3267,Christine,2024-01-11,Lovely hotel and friendly staff but rooms could have been warmer as it was a very cold night Good breakfast The duvet was too thin. It was a very cold night
3268,Maria,2024-01-11,"Pleasant and convenient Convenient location, clean and accessible. Good breakfast choices. Lunch and evening meal menus are pretty basic and are like heated up prepared meals rather than fresh cooked."
3269,Pearce,2024-01-10,Good The staff extremely helpful as I had a bad knee gave me a room on lower floor and brought drinks to my table first class. Ever time door leading out to airport opened draught was tiresome when eating. Sorry to say as a ex chef burger was awful dry bun not toasted a crime really shame as menu in my opinion wants living up not one fish dish and to many curries.
3270,Andrew,2024-01-10,I would use a different airport to avoid being taken advantage of due to the lack of competition in Only a 5 minute walk to the terminal. Food was good but drinks were excessively expensive. Just profiteering. Shame on you!
3271,Vix73,2024-01-09,"For one night only Location, food was good. Staff were helpful, polite and friendly. The fact that the hotel did not offer free parking for guests who are staying overnight."
3272,Susan,2024-01-09,Very good Excellent location for flying from the airport. Nice cooked breakfast.
3273,Revey,2024-01-09,. So glad we booked this part of our journey A safe evening chill before an early morning flight Couldn‚Äôt access the heating/air conditioning. There again we didn‚Äôt ask!
3274,Brendan,2024-01-09,"Ideal for a one night stay pre flight. Location. Walking distance to the airport departure lounge. Clean, safe hotel. It‚Äôs a bit bland. The food offering wasn‚Äôt great. A bit of a transit feel. Ok for a night but it‚Äôs definitely got the one night traveller feel."
3275,David,2024-01-09,First time using a stay at hotel for an early departure which was good. Quiet and cosy room with comfortable bed. More information about packaged breakfast available for early departure would have been appreciated plus quickest route out to airport.
3276,Roger,2024-01-09,"Convenient for a stop over. The location right next to the airport, very convenient. It‚Äôs a bit soulless.The bar set up was a bit strange. Served our purpose."
3277,Philip,2024-01-09,"Superb Nbr1 it was next to the Bristol Airport. It was clean and comfortable. Staff were ok. Hit my leg twice on the bedframe! The staff could have been freindlier I think.but over all it was good, the food was fab!!"
3278,Kenny,2024-01-08,Superb staff breakfast
3279,Moira,2024-01-08,Handy location for Airport Breakfast& location excellent
3280,Glue,2024-01-08,Superb Comfortable and clean Everything good
3281,Julie,2024-01-08,Very good Close to airport
3282,Erin,2024-01-07,Great for early flights Rooms were good size and clean.
3283,Jan,2024-01-06,A bit expensive for what it is but it‚Äôs the best option for an early flight. Excellent location for early flight. It was clean and functional. Nothing to dislike.
3284,Lynne,2024-01-04,Feel a tiny bit ripped off by breakfast. Breakfast has clearly been cut back itcwas ok but not worth the outlay. Room was good all fine.
3285,Mike,2024-01-04,"Great place to stay on the way out early or returning later We had an early flight out from the airport the next day, so getting up at 5 am at the hotel was great with leaving two or three hours before this from home. Reception staff were great even had a little breakfast before we left. We would stay there again in the similar circumstances. No problems"
3286,Nicki,2024-01-04,"Good Comfortable room, great bathroom The breakfast was disappointing."
3287,Maria,2024-01-03,Good Priority to airport
3288,Helen-louise,2024-01-03,"Excellent facility when travelling to and from Bristol Airport. Staff and location, great service and nice food. The carpet design. Ugh!"
3289,Giordano,2024-01-02,Perfect for what we needed. Comfortable and spacious room. Excellent shower. Good breakfast. Conveniently located.
3290,Lloyd,2023-12-31,"Superb Every member of staff we encountered were incredibly friendly, helpful and welcoming."
3291,Maria,2023-12-31,"Very convenient for airport, comfortable and friendly staff. Convenient to airport, nice comfy beds. In my view, the basic lunch and dinner food menu lets the hotel down. Curry ‚Äòspecial‚Äô tastes like a standard supermarket microwave meal. Food always seems like it is just heated up prepared meals and not cooked from scratch. Ok but basic and not very appetising. Even the menu itself is like a piece of laminated card and does not look very professional. I think an improvement to the above will go a long way to promoting the image of a classier hotel."
3292,Hannah,2023-12-31,Functional Location next to the airport
3293,Katherine,2023-12-31,"Excellent receptionist The lady at reception was lovely, very professional and accommodating. Unfortunately I didn't get her name. Parking charge."
3294,James,2023-12-30,Very good Airport Locality Car Park Charge excessive
3295,Alison,2023-12-30,"Friendly, comfortable hotel with value for money Spacieux and comfortable room. Staff friendly and efficient. Breakfast varied and delicious."
3296,David,2023-12-29,Very good Ideal for on airport location with no need for a transfer bus Hotel is low down relative to the departure hall so even with ramps there is a longish haul out in the rain to get into the terminal
3297,Janine,2023-12-29,"Great stay in great location The staff were very efficient, the hotel was clean and comfortable and the fact that they provided breakfast from 4 am was fantastic for those with an early flight The bed and pillows were very firm"
3298,Jennifer,2023-12-28,"Ok, what l 3xoect3d. Breakfast very good. Bit of a limited menu for dinner. Couldn't open my window. Always have my bedroom window open at night even if only just a little bit."
3299,Ian,2023-12-28,Excellent Location. Evening meal. Breakfast. Very minor: no choice of different teas in room and no USB charging points
3300,Suzanne,2023-12-27,"Good Location, cleanliness Bed very uncomfortable and squeaked with movement"
3301,Timothy,2023-12-26,Very good very close to airport and onward transport. breakfast excellent.
3302,Rhiannon,2023-12-26,"Superb Great room, comfortable and spacious Nothing, all great"
3303,Steve,2023-12-25,Family airport stay The location to the airport was amazing Quick check in and car drop off Great choices for breakfast And evening meal was nice also And comfortable beds
3304,Andrew,2023-12-23,Nice comfy hotel right next to the airport terminal. Perfect for an early morning flight. Nice comfy hotel right next to the airport terminal. Perfect for an early morning flight.
3305,Sophie,2023-12-22,Nice clean friendly hotel The position and the quality of all the furnishings were very high. There were staff there if you needed. Very small choice of drinks in the room with the kettle. No decaf. No usb plugs.
3306,Johanna,2023-12-22,Very good Availability at the last minute due to flight change Good breakfast
3307,Nigel,2023-12-22,Good Pleasant staffat reception. Overrpriced drinks in bar.
3308,Shaun,2023-12-21,Very handy so close to airport but overpriced  Internet was very limited access.
3309,Zemir,2023-12-20,"Good Nice, clean and easy to access from the airport. Arrived a little earlier (before 2pm - which check in time). I was informed to await to 1pm so they will ensure that I can get my room. Came to reception to check in at 1.15pm but suddenly were asked to pay additional fee since I arrived before 2pm (= 20 pounds). Better situation awareness is needed - especially comparing to other Hilton Garden hotel - Birmingham which I stayed same week."
3310,Andrew,2023-12-20,Good location and facilities Convenient location Not much
3311,Joanna,2023-12-19,"Nice room, good location but not without issues. The beds are really comfy, rooms spacious and airy. Lovely bathroom. Breakfast was good. The location couldn't have been any better, literally just across the road from the terminal building. We had an issue with our room when we checked in. I won't go into details but the night manager seemed quite mortified by it. The next day we were given a can of pop and a bar of chocolate each by way of an apology. I think given the nature of our complaint and how much we paid for the room, this seemed a little insulting."
3312,Alan,2023-12-17,"Very good I bought an excellent burger and chips for my evening meal. But more of a choice of a set menu, more formal, evening meal which I would expect from a ""Hilton"" hotel instead of ""fast food"" would have been preferable. Breakfast was good, although the English breakfast could have started a little earlier because of early flights. I could not fault the room, clean and warm and even though just yards from the runway - no noise from aircraft!!! Usually not a hassle to get from the hotel to the departure lounge - but difficult when the site is being upgraded. The only fault I can state is the fact that, even though it was beyond the hotel's control, the area around the departure/arrival terminals were being, so called ""upgraded"". I believe that the hotel could have offered customers a free system for them and their baggage to have been taken to and from the terminals, instead of the 10 - 12 minute convoluted walk, when the walk would usually have taken 2-3 minutes! Wouldn't have been a problem except for the fact it was pouring with rain!! And a taxi for the 500 metre ride was quoted at ¬£15!!!"
3313,Callum,2023-12-15,Very good The friendly staff and it was easy to walk to and from the airport terminal. Air conditioning was to high making sleep a little uncomfortable.
3314,Olof,2023-12-15,Convenient Rooom was cold and unheated Being cold in a premium priced property
3315,Rhiannon,2023-12-15,"Superb Rooms was very clean, very friendly staff and a good variety at breakfast. Family rooms were a bit of a squeeze for 3 people with suitcases."
3316,Jean,2023-12-14,The room was clean and comfortable and the people behind the desks were very helpful Help getting to the airport The decor is a bit dated and the seating in the bar areas were a bit shabby
3317,Tandy,2023-12-14,"OK, marred by check in issues! Proximity to the airport. Daisy on reception at check in was very pleasant and professional. Very rude Duty Manager( ?) at Check in. Think she was called Laura/Lauren? She needs to attend/re attend a Customer Services course!! There were some issues with the hotel card terminal not processing Visa Credit Cards and she did not handle it in a courteous or professional manner, unfortunately."
3318,Peter,2023-12-14,Good Location It's always a little expensive for a very short stay
3319,Almut,2023-12-12,A good stay in an overpriced hotel The hotel is within a few minutes walk from Bristol Airport. I booked it because of a very late arrival in Bristol. The hotel is overpriced and takes advantage of the only accommodation within easy reach of the airport.
3320,Mary-jane,2023-12-11,"Good The nearness to Bristol airport terminal The expensive wine, small main meal and poor coffee"
3321,Louise,2023-12-11,Good location. Download app to make check in quicker Location was good Car park building works made access difficult from main car park. Clearer details of onsite parking would be helpful
3322,Paul,2023-12-10,Perfect The friendly atmosphere
3323,Rhianydd,2023-12-10,"So handy! The staff are really friendly Breakfast is good,plenty of choice Location is perfect, of course The bed wasn't great. Everything my husband turned over,my whole body bounced!"
3324,Peter,2023-12-10,. Good all around
3325,Pamela,2023-12-09,"Comfortable but pricey Location perfect for the flight. Room comfortable. Clean. Food while the basic menu was nice. Reception staff were slow. The restaurant staff disorganised, the wine was not cold. For a Hilton expectations were sadly not meet. They have a captive audience."
3326,Michael,2023-12-08,Short Location Nothing but Premier inn do a proper breakfast and the shower is more powerful and there mattresses are better quality.But as there is no Premier at this location Hampton will have to do
3327,Richard,2023-12-08,One or two issues but otherwise good Very close to the airport You had to pay for the car park & the barrier for the car park is surrounded by curd stones which have a high lip at the ends& if you approach it from the car park at right angles it catches the car skirt as you have to get close to feed your ticket into the machine All under the same post code as the airport so if you are unfamiliar with the area it's awkward to find
3328,James,2023-12-07,"Great location, clean room but your paying for over the odds. The location is great The food was very average. And the price is high! It‚Äôs a fancy travel in at best."
3329,Pauline,2023-12-07,Great overnight stay after a long flight Staff friendly and helpful breakfast good room comfortable and quiet: Nothing
3330,Paul,2023-12-06,Perfect for our flight time (08.45) Was at airport for our flight We came down for breakfast at 6am when it starts and full English was Luke warm at best
3331,Cheryl,2023-12-04,Good comfortable accommodation. Comfortable beds and room. Location in airport grounds. Friendly staff. Good breakfast included. Bit pricey but airport hotels usually are due to location.
3332,Alistair,2023-12-03,Ideal for an early flight New hotel very comfortable and clean.large beds.nice food at reasonable prices. Nothing
3333,Victoria,2023-12-02,"Very good Room, bed and pillows, staff. Expensive bar and food. Bit chilly in bar/restaurant"
3334,Natalie,2023-12-02,Superb Room was very nice Long trek from the terminal due to road works
3335,Carol,2023-12-01,Good once we found how to get to it. Convenient to airport The pathway to the hotel from the airport was dreadful. The surface was bad for suitcase wheels and the signage was haphazard.
3336,Beverly,2023-12-01,Superb  Not having trolleys available to take multiple cases to airport. Had to walk to airport to find some and then bring them back to load up. No sound on TV BBC1
3337,Elaine,2023-12-01,"Great location for an early flight, but you pay a premium for the location Excellent location for an early flight at Bristol Airport. Room clean, well equipped, comfortable and quiet. Early breakfast available at 4am. Friendly staff. Expensive"
3338,Julia,2023-12-01,Very comfy room I feel the room was overpriced compared to previous stays.
3339,Cat,2023-11-30,"Excellent location and ok stay Location excellent and staff very nice Cleanliness wasn‚Äôt great- hairs in the bed etc and it was expensive for what it was, even if location was great"
3340,Kevin,2023-11-29,"My review It was comfortable and clean, and the staff were friendly. The car park should be free for guests, the fact it's airport property is a you problem not a me problem and charging excessive fees for parking makes you look very bad üëé"
3341,Noriko,2023-11-29,"Clean and comfortable airport hotel Perfect location (easy access to the airport), clean and big room, very comfortable bed and pillows, helpful staff. All good"
3342,Joseph,2023-11-28,"Superb I needed somewhere to stay at the airport last minute after plans changed and this was ideal. The staff were friendly and the room spacious, clean and comfortable. It gave me peace of mind. Everything was fine."
3343,Jillian,2023-11-28,"Very good, I will use this hotel in the future. Reception. Food. Comfort. Lack of hotel directions in multi-storey car park."
3344,Simone,2023-11-27,Very good 24 hour reception Comfortable bed Uninspiring breakfast Rather expensive
3345,Caroline,2023-11-26,"Superb Great location, excellent staff and rooms were comfortable. The menu in the bar area wasn't very good."
3346,Carol,2023-11-26,Clean and comfortable room with very good staff at the bar and restaurant . Location was good for the airport but unfortunately getting into the airport was difficult due to all the work on the transport system changes. As above
3347,Anne,2023-11-26,"Due to its location will stay again, but not the 'whow' factor I expected. Easy access to Bristol Airport. Communal seating areas were very impersonal. Thought that for a top rated hotel that the facilities could have been more 'luxutious'."
3348,Jacci,2023-11-25,"Perfect overnight stay, shame not room service Clean and comfortable No room service"
3349,Donald,2023-11-25,Ideal for a stay prior to an early morning flight The hotel was very clean with helpful and friendly staff Service in the restaurant was quick and of reasonable quality Room was clean with a reasonable bathroom and shower although a little small The price for the room I thought was a little overpriced but I suspect that‚Äôs the price you pay for a hotel at an airport The price of the food was a little expensive to
3350,Margaret,2023-11-25,Everything as expected Everything was fine and welcomed by Ali. Would prefer the option of no breakfast
3351,Patricia,2023-11-24,Convenient and serves a purpose Everything as is very convenient Nothing it serves a purpose
3352,Sharon,2023-11-24,Pre flight booking Proximity to the airport Clean newly refurbished Comfortable bed Quiet Friendly All good
3353,Susan,2023-11-24,"Convenient location for an early flight Comfort, general layout, breakfast Duvet was a bit thin for time of year (felt cold during night)"
3354,Tandy,2023-11-24,Not up to previous experience! Comfortable bed Brad in reception very helpful at checkout due to taxi issues Walk from airport too long due to exterior works. Workmen drilling at 9am‚Ä¶ Unable to process my credit card via booking. com due to their ‚Äúmachine not working‚Äù.. stressful check in procedure
3355,Aled,2023-11-24,"Very good Location although lots of roadworks, which could be managed better The price is excessive"
3356,Tonia,2023-11-23,"I would stay again but wouldn‚Äôt eat Location apart from the building works beside the property Food,very limited, basic ,poor menu"
3357,Celia,2023-11-22,"perfect end to a great holiday Comfortable beds, very clean, great shower, friendly staff. cooked breakfast a little disappointing"
3358,Godelieve,2023-11-22,"Absolutely worth staying here the night before an early flight! Quiet, lovely, comfortable room. Very clean and modern facilities, welcoming atmosphere The quality of the food available was not geared towards healthy eating. It would be nice to be able to have a more ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô meal before travelling."
3359,Jacqueline,2023-11-21,Very good Perfect location to catch flight early next day Room was nice beds were confy
3360,Cherry,2023-11-20,Comfortable stay with nice breakfast Proximity to airport and comfort. Breakfast was also good. Redirection from airport (I realise that this is temporary during works) as these meant quite a long walk from the property
3361,Robert,2023-11-20,Very pleasant 1 night stay but can be expensive Great location by the airport Price could have been better
3362,Michael,2023-11-20,"An excellent place to stay if you have a flight from Bristol airport Ecelent car parking, Organization of disabled transport to terminal for my wife. Allocation of ground floor room as my wife's walking is poor Great that breakfast started at 4am as we had an early morning staff Excellent bar staff Front desk very busy at peak periods Room rather smelly when we first went in AirCon/Heating a challenge Construction at airport meant a long walk with luggage to terminal (this was not the hotels' fault)"
3363,Olaf,2023-11-20,"Comfy and quiet hotel close to airport Close to airport, quiet and comfortable rooms, spacious bar/restaurant Inflexible on booking cancellations, expensive for what is a glorified Premier Inn"
3364,Ann,2023-11-20,"Handy for an early morning flight. Clean, comfortable, easy airport access. The shower wasn‚Äôt working properly."
3365,Caroline,2023-11-19,"Great place to stay if you are flying out early in the morning. Good breakfast, beds are very comfortable. The walk across the car park is a bit tricky due to ongoing work."
3366,Susan,2023-11-19,"Very good Staff were very welcoming The walk from the hotel to the tunnel to go to the airport. Was very dark. As a woman on her own, was not good."
3367,Roger,2023-11-19,Ok.  Food very basic eg burgers curry etc. a steak would be good or a salad! Not cheap food but motorway service standard. Most of us off on holiday would prefer something better. And healthier.
3368,Trevor,2023-11-19,"Ideal for a short stay. Close to the airport, The breakfast was really good. Nothing."
3369,Elizabeth,2023-11-16,Convenient but bar very expensive. At the airport but roadworks so long wet walk to departures As above
3370,Paula,2023-11-16,Superb Pleasant and helpful staff member on arrival even though it was 1.30am.. room had everything needed for overnight stay .. great breakfast and lovely staff on check out sign posting from terminal due to construction is poor and needs more lightning .. dark and wet on arrival and was difficult to see how to get to hotel
3371,Frances,2023-11-15,"Very good Handy for the airport, quick food service Extra bed in family room was uncomfortable"
3372,Derek,2023-11-15,Ok as a transient hotel you would not want to stay otherwise Close to airport Current problems with walkway to airport making it harder to drag a suitcase uphill with no reduction in rates due to this issue.
3373,Lesley,2023-11-14,Useful for early departures and late arrivals Close to the airport Because of the building works on the airport the walk from airport to Hotel is longer and uncovered. Not great when you arrive and it‚Äôs raining and you have 2 hold bags and 2 cabin bags after a 5 week stay out of the country.
3374,Loveday,2023-11-14,"Great location but food awful Our rooms were booked for the wrong dates by Booking.com - but the Hilton did manage to find us a room for the night and although we didnt get two rooms they did give us one for the 3 of us which was find and didnt charge us, so I was grateful for that. Booking.com messed up and booked us for the wrong nights - so we didnt get the two rooms I had booked - but just one. Our room wasn't that clean (snot on the wall - yuck) but as we were so tired we just ignored it. Food was pretty awful for the price and too early to have breakfast."
3375,Ken,2023-11-13,"Very good hotel at airport, but pity about access pathway diversion due to renovation of car parking. Proximity to airport, early Continental breakfast and standard of facilities. The tortuous path to get to it from the airport building due to the renovations of airport parking. Bathroom has nowhere to hang towels after you shower."
3376,Nicole,2023-11-11,"Fabulous, convenient but expensive Convenience and excellent friendly staff Expensive"
3377,Monica,2023-11-11,Apart from the coffee I liked everything. I liked everything except the coffee machine. I think it would be good to have proper coffee to start the day. Coffee from a machine always tastes awful. I didn't bring a car but I think the car park is too expensive.
3378,Shona,2023-11-10,"One night stay. Thought I would hear planes going in and out, but somehow, no noise! Queing up to register. Had to wait a good while, at registration desk."
3379,Jill,2023-11-09,Helpful staff and convenient Location
3380,Elaine,2023-11-09,"Great overnight stay ready for an early morning flight. Very welcoming, great location very close to the terminal. Room was lovely, bed comfy and bathroom immaculate. Nothing"
3381,Barry,2023-11-08,Comfortable and convenient Close to airport Convenient parking Cost of parking could have been included in price for at least 1 or2 nights. Other hotels give substantial discount or free parking if staying longer than one night
3382,Michael,2023-11-07,Superb Very comfortable Price per room
3383,Kevin,2023-11-07,"Satisfactory. Excellent service from staff, they could not have been more helpful. Check-in was easy. Room and bathroom comfortable and clean. Duvet so thin that I had to put on socks! Cooked breakfast - I would expect fried and/ or poached eggs, not scrambled; neither do hard-boiled ones suffice."
3384,Dawn,2023-11-07,"Great Staff, Clean, Beds need making more comfy xx Staff friendly and proffesional I shared a room with my daughter as we had an early flight. I slept in the sofa bed. It was very hard and uncomfortable."
3385,Carole,2023-11-06,Convenient but expensive Close to terminal Expensive Not much food choice Not even a reduced parking incentive
3386,Ttg,2023-11-06,"Pleasant stay but could do better The reception / checking in personnel were polite and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful and nice seating area and enjoyable. We ate in the restaurant, although limited choices the food was acceptable but nothing special. The room seemed quite basic for a Hampton by Hilton, the bathroom could do with more hooks to hang your clothing, towels and more room to place toiletries on seemed limited on places to put your belongings. The bed seemed small for a king room."
3387,Jayne,2023-11-06,"Superb The location was very convenient, the room was comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful. The only drawback for our stay was that there was a lot of work being carried out in the airport grounds therefore the distance to walk was much further , so less convenient."
3388,Julieta,2023-11-05,Very good Breakfast since 4am One side of the bed kept dropping me out the bed due to bent mattress
3389,Suzy,2023-11-05,One night as very early start at airport. Breakfast from 4 am so able to eat something before we left. Staff very helpfu Close to airport.
3390,Martin,2023-11-05,"Difficult and tricky. All our clothes are soaking. It was refreshing to see everything you needed was there, and the staff were exceptional The problem is that Bristol Airport is undergoing major infrastructure changes and it took over an hour to drive from the main road to the hotel. We then had to do bag drop in the airport and the walk was 10 minutes in pouring rain with no canopy shelter. we had the same journey in the morning to the airport in the pouring rain. We are going on a cruise so had four bags to drag through and made paths. It was very dangerous on the roads approaching the hotel with people resorting to walking in the dark in the rain with no street lights. The car rental place took nearly an hour to get from the hotel to drop off and back again. Had we known this we would‚Äôve stayed somewhere else."
3391,Bruce,2023-11-05,"Good- staff, clean room, pretty good value. Breakfast good. Dinner only fair in my book. Clean The long walk to the hotel from the airport and back. No shuttle service. Cab ¬£42 each way, not good!."
3392,Michael,2023-11-04,So convenient for airport with very early flight. Noted continental breakfast available from 0400.. Room was perfect. Up to expectation. Rather expensive for single occupancy.
3393,Kate,2023-11-04,Would use again if flight time necessitated a stay. Great little airport hotel. Disappointed by poor breakfast - not the best continental offering. No cooked option available until 6am
3394,William,2023-11-03,Atm very poor access The room was excellent so were the staff .breakfast very good We booked the hotel due to the location being very close to the terminal however due to works being carried out its is a nightmare to get to on foot deffinatly not suitable for most people young families elderly or the disabled in particular with no shuttle assistance available which caused myself and wife alot of anxiety which after strenuously complaining to the hotel they did arrange disabled assistance which should have already been in place ..apart from that the hotel is fine in all other respects
3395,Joodles,2023-11-03,"Very good Comfortable, convenient stay very close to the airport building."
3396,Lucy,2023-11-03,"Convenient, clean and a good family breakfast included Location, breakfast, cleanliness We had multiple payment amounts pending in bank. This was resolved within 48 hours but the total was pending 3 times resulting in over a ¬£1000 pending in my bank account"
3397,Joseph,2023-11-03,Great location The location and cleanliness. But the construction works around make the walk quite long.Lovely staff. Sausages undercooked.
3398,Rachael,2023-11-02,"Very good Location to airport, lovely clean and modern rooms"
3399,Kevin,2023-11-01,Relaxing and a great way to start out break Great location ideal for pre flight stay staff friendly and helpful
3400,Claire,2023-10-30,"Apart from the menu, everything was really good and the staff are fantastic and super helpful! Convenient, clean, modern and great staff! The limited menu was not very good."
3401,Lydiarich,2023-10-30,Perfect start for a holiday Convenience to the airport especially for early morning flights
3402,Raymond,2023-10-29,Pricey due to location No breakfast Friendlier staff
3403,Colin,2023-10-29,"Very good hotel - if you can find it nice modern hotel with all the facilities you might want Well the problem for me was getting to the hotel. It's hidden away behind the multistory car park. Because of the work going on at Bristol Airport, you had to follow signs which weren't obvious to begin with!"
3404,John,2023-10-29,Overnight stay for early flight. Location Maintenance works.
3405,Nicola,2023-10-28,Fantastic choice for overnight stay before travel Welcoming staff üôÇ. Great atmosphere and fantastic breakfast üëçüèª Pillows a little hard
3406,Sophie,2023-10-28,perfect apart from we were tired from flight 1.30am so misheard breakfast timeüò¨ location clean very comfortable no fridge breakfast finished at 10am (we thought it was 10.30am so were 7 mins late for breakfast so missed itüò≠)
3407,Joanne,2023-10-28,Convenient - but not as convenient as my last stay Clean and tidy Building works mean it‚Äôs not really an easy walk in the middle of the night and certainly not well lit and signposted. This work is extensive so travellers should be made aware on booking
3408,Olga,2023-10-28,Good option if one has an early or late flight Great location with a possibility to check in any time. Comfortable rooms. Good shower and beds. Very expensive. Breakfast could have been better.
3409,Ada,2023-10-27,"Apart from the debit card problem, the stay was as expected. The room, the staff and the breakfast The evening meal selection. The now extended walk from the airport The fact that my debit card (despite being perfectly valid and used that very evening in the restaurant0 was declined and I had to use a different one."
3410,Mary-jane,2023-10-26,Very good and useful The situation. Friendly staff....clean and welcoming. Good ample breakfast. ¬£9 for a glass of wine!!!! Somewhat OTT...... Wine definitely to be avoided in the future!
3411,Penny,2023-10-26,Our first stay at this hotel Was great. Amazing bathroom and room.was huge for the three of us.
3412,David,2023-10-25,Great if you can find it from the terminal ??? all fine will use again The directions from the airport left alot to desire at one in the morrning having followed the guide ended up in the car park???
3413,Lauren,2023-10-25,"Lovely Staff were excellent, rooms are lovely and the soaps etc provided The path to the hotel from the airport and back to the airport wasn't clear. It was dark when we arrived and left and walked a long road way to get there when extremely tired after flight delays, in the rain, carrying luggage, when it's literally over the road. Clearer signposted paths needed. Some sort of construction was happening so maybe that's what's happening. Left too early to get any breakfast. Would be nice if there was a bagged up to go option"
3414,Sarah,2023-10-24,"Great Closeness to the airport, comfy room, great shower, best breakfast No bar fridge"
3415,Kath,2023-10-24,"Relaxing comfortable stay The location is perfect and we were lucky to be given a ground floor room. The receptionist was excellent, could not have been more helpful. The beds were super comfy and the breakfast was amazing with so much choice The bathroom was clean, but there was a leak coming from something. We were so tired that we just put up with it. I did report it when checking out the next day"
3416,Leo,2023-10-23,"A busy but comfortable hotel doing a good job of managing guests' needs. Evening food was very efficiently provided to a busy room, and it was good quality food. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Room was the quietest I have ever found in a hotel. Location is excellent. Bed was somewhat hard. TV remote broken."
3417,Leanne,2023-10-23,Very good How clean it was very comfortable üòå
3418,Jane,2023-10-23,Ideally situated for airport and comfortable room and helpful staff. Good standards all round. Helpful staff. Not the fault of the property in any way but due to ‚Äòworks‚Äô in the airport arrivals area the route from the hotel with large suitcase and cabin suitcase in the rain was not great!
3419,Michelle,2023-10-23,"Very good A lovely hotel, so easy for flying early for holiday! Although a bit pricey. Price"
3420,Kyansenga,2023-10-22,Great for airport connections Good sized room Congestion at meal times
3421,Daniel,2023-10-22,"Good hotel, needs improving in certain areas Location, clean room, friendly staff Price of food is comparable with other hotels, snacks are overpriced to the point of exploitation Breakfast could be better, no brown sauce, no fried eggs, poor quality bacon and sausages. ¬£7 pint served in warm glass so beer flat had to change twice"
3422,Jackie,2023-10-21,"necessary, not by choice  beds were hard, food choices poor expensive food and drinks"
3423,Paul,2023-10-20,"Well functioning, modern, ideally located Great location, very clean and well functioning. Beds and pillows super comfortable You queue for service at bar like your getting school dinner. Did not like this Hotel has no personality"
3424,Andrea,2023-10-19,Very good Reception manned when we arrived in the early hours - friendly staff. A good choice of vegan options at breakfast. All OK thanks.
3425,Laureana,2023-10-19,Very good -close to the airport -reasonable food. Enjoyed the early breakfast. -lovely and helpful staff - No charging plugs in the room. I had to borrow an adapter downstairs because I have spanish plugs on my phone charger. I would expect an airport hotel room to have USB plugs. -My towel in my room was stained with makeup. It had been cleaned but it is not inviting to use a towel that was staines.
3426,Jerry,2023-10-19,"Very good Clean, good breakfast Due to the car park works at the airport the access to the hotel is a much longer distance and is very poorly signposted"
3427,Patrick,2023-10-19,Comfortable and convenient for early morning flight Proximity to airport for early morning flight It was expensive
3428,Christopher,2023-10-19,"Good  Pedestrian access to terminal is very bad. Deviations more than double the required walking distance. Staff excuse that this is the airport not the hotel, shows that the hotel is not doing enough to improve the situation. Staff did not warn that the hotel was ‚Äúcash free‚Äù and we were unable to purchase drinks unless using credit cards. A warning upon arrival is necessary."
3429,Katharine,2023-10-19,Very good Surprisingly pleasant reception area and rooms A bit expensive
3430,Heidi,2023-10-17,"Convenient, clean, quality furnishings, friendly staff Clean, comfortable No USB chargers in the room or biscuits with coffee"
3431,Aisling,2023-10-17,"food was v good and drinks ok price, room just a bit pricey but location excellent location I think it is a bit expensive for a night before a flight"
3432,Georgina,2023-10-17,Good Our second room once we were relocated was fine. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast choices good. Stayed one night due to late flights snd was conveniently close to the airport and bus stands. Not impressed after checking into our room to find the toilet with dried black faecal matter all around the pan. Rang reception and she said she would sort it and hung up. We didn't know if we were meant to wait or go back to reception. After a short time elapsed we rang again to be told it was being dealt with. Then we were were ushered to a room on another floor. No apologies just a excuse that the cleaners make mistakes. Not at all pleasant to walk into after along day.
3433,Coralline,2023-10-17,Very good the waffles the location the staff
3434,Martin,2023-10-17,"Very good, I shall use it again It was a pleasant surprise to be able to get a reasonable breakfast even very early in the morning"
3435,Fleur,2023-10-16,Exceptionally good location. Shame it‚Äôs so expensive Location The price!!
3436,Claire,2023-10-16,"Very good Very convenient for the airport, literally a 5 minute walk to the terminal door. Comfortable room, friendly staff. Nice restaurant area, not huge choice but food good. Last time I stayed last year there was a breakfast bag to take away if you were on an early flight which didn't happen this year. Seeing as breakfast is included in the price we felt this was a bit of a con. If you're not going to supply anything then there should be a choice of price with breakfast included or not."
3437,Yvonne,2023-10-16,"Comfortable, clean but expensive Location. Clean and comfortable Pricey"
3438,Sandra,2023-10-16,"Comfortable nights stay prior to my journey. Accessible to airport, easy check in, and friendly staff. Quiet too considering near the airport. Very clean. Nothing"
3439,Caldwell,2023-10-15,"It was really comfortable and easy - an excellent airport hotel. Bed exceptionally comfortable, room spacious and breakfast excellent. Slightly limited bar snacks and eating option late at night (when I arrived)."
3440,Michael,2023-10-15,All OK It was very convenient for the airport The trek from the coach park to the hotel.
3441,Lin,2023-10-15,Very comfortable quiet rooms with great facilities Clem modern rooms very well equipped with a great shower and lovely fluffy towels Great gym The price of two glasses of wine at the bar!! The path from the hotel to the terminal building was close for building work and the diversion was a very long way around
3442,Andrew,2023-10-15,Superb Unexpectedly good pre 6am breakfast
3443,Andrew,2023-10-13,Fine for the short time we stayed. Air conditioning in the eating area was too cold and uncomfortab Too early a flight for proper breakfast. Takeaway bag for breakfast supplied by hotel pretty unexciting. Breakfast bag
3444,Julie,2023-10-12,Okay At the airport All the work going on outside the building had to take my case a long way around
3445,Geoff,2023-10-12,"Convenient, did what it said on the can booked last minute, overnight stay, no issues Nothing"
3446,Ian,2023-10-12,"Will use again Clean, colour schemes were fine, staff were great, from check in to bar and supper and a super bright ‚Äògood morning‚Äô at 0350hrs. Breakfast and supper, although not stunning in choice, filled us with no complaints To be honest, given this is a Premier Inn level airport hotel, it was clean with a nice bed, sufficient room and the social areas were fine. There was nothing to dislike"
3447,Richard,2023-10-11,"Convenient for Early morning flight We have stayed here many times and as usual everything was great - however Bristol airport has changed over the last 5 years so its not such an attractive location to stay for travellers with 2 large bags and using Rental car as Avis etc ( who used to be just a short walk from the Hotel ) have moved(been moved ) to Silverstone Parking so you have to check in at the hotel, drop your bags, get an hour of free parking then drive out of the hotel car park , drop the car at Silver Stone parking then get the bus to the terminal - since there were no trolleys provided, I grabbed one at the Terminal and took it all the way to our room No trolleys at the hotel - long walk to terminal in the morning due to extensive Bristol Airport extensions to Car Parks etc - thats not the Hotel's fault but it makes it less attractive. That said for early morning flight still the best place to stay near the airport."
3448,Jacqui,2023-10-11,"Convenient, welcoming Clean & modern The restaurant was nice but the queuing system to order wasn‚Äôt great."
3449,Patricia,2023-10-10,Satisfactory Everything! Evening meal
3450,Michael,2023-10-09,Very good As an airport hotel it had everything you need. very clean. comfortable and efficient. Continental breakfast from 4.00am was perfect for an early flight. Parking by the hotel is very convenient and the hotel is close to the airport departures. nothing
3451,Lesley,2023-10-09,"Probably stay elsewhere and catch a shuttle bus next time we go away. Close to Airport, friendly helpful staff The detour walk to the airport whilst the building works in place. Fortunately it wasn‚Äôt raining. Would have been drenched if it had been. The food choice for evening meals was very limited."
3452,Asta,2023-10-09,"Good Nice room,lovely staff and very clean. Difficult to get with wheelchair from bus station. Long corridor till the room with wheelchair and luggage...not much space in room for disabled person and night light is impossible to turn on with arthritis in fingers. Comfortable beds,but child's bed edges very sharp."
3453,Wendy,2023-10-09,Convenient for early morning flight Convenient Bathroom sliding door was very stiff and heavy to open
3454,Kirstine,2023-10-09,"The hotel suited these weary travellers perfectly. In Bristol Airport. The perfect location for the weary traveller. Good reception at 3am. Nice, comfortable,clean room. with excellent sound proofing. Perfect after a long, tiring journey and flight. Wandering around the self service breakfast which closed ruthlessly at 10am."
3455,Deborah,2023-10-09,"Superb Staff very helpful and accommodating, bar at nightmare good, breakfast very tasty üòã"
3456,Michael,2023-10-09,"Clean and modern and quick access to the airport but the price is outrageous. It was easy to locate and a short walk to departures. The room was modern and had everything we needed and was clean and comfortable. Breakfast is included in the price but was of no use to us as we had an early flight. However the cost per night of this hotel stings! ¬£180 to stay for 1 night is a little outrageous to be honest. Airport hotel or not! We could have parked for 2 weeks for less, which will be our preferred option if the price is still high when we are travelling from Bristol again."
3457,Tim,2023-10-09,Superb Near airport Great check in staff Nothing
3458,Mcmahon,2023-10-09,Superb Close to airport a great base to stop over
3459,Mcmahon,2023-10-09,Superb Close to airport and very Accommodating
3460,Mcmahon,2023-10-09,Superb Close to airport and they are very accommodating Food can be hot and miss
3461,Margaret,2023-10-08,Close to airport perfect Great location to airport
3462,Melissa,2023-10-08,Very good Very good Nil
3463,Paula,2023-10-08,The location is fab. Will definitely be back. Room was lovely and quiet. Spotlessly clean. Location couldn‚Äôt have been better. The pillows were very uncomfortable which spoilt the quality of sleep. Breakfast was disappointing. It‚Äôs very expensive.
3464,David,2023-10-07,Clean and comfortable but don‚Äôt waste money eating their food. Clean and comfortable. The food was TERRIBLE. Clearly designed to be as profitable as possible for The Hilton Group and a miserable experience for the customer. The Singapore Noodles that I had were tasteless and such a mean portion that I was still hungry after finishing them.
3465,Elizabeth,2023-10-07,Very good Breakfast was great
3466,Alison,2023-10-07,"Convenient short stay How near it is to airport terminal, Comfy beds and breakfast Checking in, the receptionist asked for payment again, but i had already paid months in advance."
3467,Maureen,2023-10-07,Very good All very good breakfast and staff very helpful
3468,Annette21,2023-10-06,"staff friendly, welcoming, provided a carrier bag breakfast due to pre 4.00am departure is brilliant The hotel is right by the airport, but there were quite a lot of steps and I would not have managed them alone with a heavy suitcase. The room was excellent - clean and comfortable. We were at the back and able to go to bed at 9pm without being woken by noise of guests or flights. Breakfast to go was very much appreciated at 3.40 am! The food in the restaurant was not as good as I had expected: the choice was limited for me, and the burger and chips I ordered as a last resort was not overwhelming, just ok. My husband chose a curry and was very happy with that. It just shows how our tastes affect our reviews. So other guests would probably love the food choices!! I didn't like the two flights of steps between the hotel and the airport departures."
3469,Martin,2023-10-06,Very good Close to the airport. Clean. Friendly staff Quite expensive for a basic hotel.
3470,Penelope,2023-10-06,"An ideal location and a comfortable stay. The fact that the hotel is just across from the airport. I liked the comfort of the rooms and proximity to airport and coach station. I do not think the standard of breakfast matches the standard of the hotel generally. For instance, last time I stayed there was a choice of fruit and yogurt which seemed to have disappeared this time. I found the level of lighting in my room very low when I arrived in the middle of the night, and needed to quickly find things in my suitcase."
3471,Chris,2023-10-06,"Very good  The food was ok, not good."
3472,Jo,2023-10-06,"Modern, well thought out hotel built for comfort and convenience to the airport. Modern clean and fresh. Convenient to airport and yet well insulated and really quiet. Staff very friendly, efficient. Food very good. Everything was great."
3473,Bowden,2023-10-05,Superb Perfect hotel Nothing I did not like
3474,Claire,2023-10-05,"Site works at the moment The hotel is handy for a pre early flight stay. My husband has difficulty walking, but when we said we had assisted travel, a member of staff arranged for us to be picked up by the airport assistance staff. This was excellent, but I think the hotel needs to tell more of their staff about this facility, another member of staff suggested we could have got a taxi at about ¬£15. There are site works going on between the airport and the hotel, so it was hard to get to the hotel."
3475,Linda,2023-10-05,hotel great once you got inside. outside not good. always a quiet and comfortable stay access was shocking on this occasion. building works all around the access making it dangerous and difficult. Couldn‚Äôt find a ramp access to the airport so had to carry luggage up lots of steep steps.
3476,Elizabeth,2023-10-04,Great location for airport stay Location close to terminal The very high costs of car parking at least the first night of staying should be complimentary
3477,Anne,2023-10-04,"Always good as the airport is over the road, but only flying so early will stop us thinking about alternative accommodat The proximity to the airport, the cleanliness, staff and included breakfast. The bed and pillows weren‚Äôt comfortable. We felt the mattress needed replacing."
3478,Anthony,2023-10-04,Nice hotel but expensive. Room and food available.
3479,Iftekhar,2023-10-04,Great location with lovely staff The location to Bristol airport is perfect Nothing to say
3480,Deborah,2023-10-03,"Very good good choice of breakfast , staff are friendly and helpful , great hotel to stay at before a flight from Bristol airport"
3481,Andrew,2023-10-03,"Extremely convenient, high quality, high price. Perfect position for the airport, comfortable, clean, exceptionally attentive staff and a really good breakfast starting early enough for the first flights. The parking arrangements are at first sight a little daunting; however the staff can help once you have the courage to pass through the barrier! The hotel is priced to exploit a captive market - don‚Äôt expect a discount. You pay for what you get convenience."
3482,Peter,2023-10-03,Good clean and convenient stay Convenient location for airport Slot of work going on around the airport surroundings
3483,Peter,2023-10-02,A really good end to our holiday on kos Top quality and value of the evening special on the menu and as always a good hotel breakfast The pathway to the airport was badly effected by construction
3484,Rebecca,2023-10-02,"Great, convenient and friendly staff Location is great for flights out of Bristol Airport and long stay parking adjacent. Staff really friendly and good bar/restaurant for evening meal. It‚Äôs quite expensive for one night stays. We left too early before breakfast was served but it would have been good if we could have been offered a continental breakfast/take away. Also couldn‚Äôt get anyone to help with the ¬£5 drop off charge as it was so busy at reception so ended up paying it."
3485,Richard,2023-10-02,Overpriced for what it is. All about closeness to airport Close to airport terminal and spacious room The cost for what is little more than a travel lodge.
3486,Ian,2023-10-02,Very good Easy next to airport Nothing
3487,Wayne,2023-10-02,Great location but you pay for it. Very good hotel in general All as expected Cost is an issue that needs to be considered with this hotel
3488,Jennifer,2023-10-01,Good  Price
3489,Richard,2023-10-01,Convenient but overpriced Easy walking distance to the airport Rather soulless airport. Breakfast in the bag was very limited
3490,Graeme,2023-10-01,Superb Quiet room
3491,John,2023-10-01,"Fine- very much what I needed, very comfortable and convenient. Good room, perfect location for my purposes, food very good, both on arrival ( the pizza is great) and at Breakfast the next morning. Excellent service, very friendly and helpful staff. The parking was a bit more expensive than advertised, and very confusing. Also, foot access to the airport is rather convoluted due to construction work."
3492,Susan,2023-10-01,"Ideal place to stay if on an early morning flight Room was very good and the breakfast first class Explaining how to get to the Hotel carpark, when we phoned the hotel and asked for the instructions on how to find the car park, the instructions were vague and unclear. It cost us ¬£7.50 as we parked in the wrong car park, when we arrived at the hotel and explained this to one of the staff they were very unhelpful about are suituation, saying it was very easy to find your carpark."
3493,Roger,2023-09-30,Superb Comfortable hotel and friendly staff. Bristol Airport. Renovations which will last for 18 months. Make access to the hotel difficult. A long walk in the pouring rain.
3494,Lesley-ann,2023-09-29,Convenient for airport Near airport Building works
3495,David,2023-09-29,Had to queue twice at reception. All very handy for airport. Were told we couldn't buy a drink at the bar until we had registered at reception to be able to do so. Had already stood in a queue to check in then had to go back and do it again. Never known anything like it - just to get a glass of wine!
3496,Alison,2023-09-29,"Ok for the convenience Mostly good. Rooms as nice as usual. Requested an extra sheet which was in the bedroom on arrival - very happy :) Staff are always nice Handy M&S in the airport terminal prior to departures (not overpriced) so we picked up a few nibbles. Early breakfast (03:00) take out was rubbish. Dry croissant, horrid apple juice and an apple or banana - that was it. Expected a much better selection for 'continental' -perhaps a portion of cheese and crackers if you don't like sweet for breakfast which I do not. Have had a much nicer breakfast at the hotel when our flight was later in the morning. Room was very nice, as expected, although it is overpriced for a room but I suppose you pay for the convenience being at the airport!"
3497,Dwayne,2023-09-29,Polite staff excellent service Convenience Ôøºto airport Overpriced
3498,Kathryn,2023-09-29,Very good Lovely reception staff. Everything clean and well maintained. Incredibly convenient location to the airport Price of food/drink at hotel. Having stayed here in July and paid ¬£40 for two tiny servings of pasta and 2 glasses of red wine. Decided to get food from M and S at the airport. Much cheaper.
3499,Deborah,2023-09-28,Good Location Was expensive with no other alternative available
3500,Sasha,2023-09-27,Very good Great location. Nice hotel. Bathroom and rooms are lovely. The beds are so uncomfortable. Food was not great. The burger was poor.
3501,Michael,2023-09-26,"Clean, modern hotel ideally located for early morning flight. Breakfast & evening meal adequate but pricey. Room good, clean & everything worked. Super bed. Alarm call right on time. Helpful staff. Access to airport terminal through building site - not something that could be helped at present. Shower tray slippery."
3502,Barbara,2023-09-26,Good location and friendly staff. Location Not the easiest check-in process.
3503,Julia,2023-09-26,"It was OK for an early morning departure The staff were helpful, and the room was clean but basic. The food in the restaurant downstairs was awful. Because we were staying there specifically to fly out the next morning, we didn't want to head into town, so it was the only option. Also, there is no shuttle to the airport. It should be a short walk but the usual path was all dug up so we had to drag heavy cases a long way."
3504,Martine,2023-09-26,good enough for one night stay and perfect for flying.  no usb points. no little extras like toothpaste would have been useful. restaurant is horrible. no flexibility . rather cold in the room.
3505,Anne,2023-09-25,Great Very helpful staff Nothing
3506,Grantmavrata,2023-09-25,"Good, but not very good. Location to the airport was very convenient, even on very late arrival just gone midnight, signage was easy to follow through groundwork being done. Was expensive compared to other chains we often use. No USB sockets in the room, often quite common these days. Nobody greeting guests at breakfast. Details but expected a little more for over ¬£200 for a night. It was a convenient option for a kate flight."
3507,John,2023-09-25,"Quite good overall Breakfast was ok I suspect scrambled eggs were powdered, bacon was hardly cooked."
3508,Hamish,2023-09-23,Very good Super efficient and friendly staff. Clean and spacious hotel. Perfect for an early morning flight.
3509,Julie,2023-09-23,"Excellent location It‚Äôs location on Bristol Airports site is so convenient Nice size room, slept extremely well Very clean and comfortable, staff lovely The evening meal quality was very poor, Shame it let the hotel down"
3510,Judy,2023-09-22,Overall very good Convenient generally very happy
3511,Gary,2023-09-21,We‚Äôll stay there again if the need comes up Great location Midnight fire alarm wasn‚Äôt on our agenda. Not property fault.
3512,Norma,2023-09-21,Very good Close to airport
3513,Grahame,2023-09-20,Very good Enjoyed my stay apart from being woken by fire alarm at 12pm Fire alarm going off after being asleep for 2 hours. Didn't seem very organised.. Room no wasn't taken How did they know every body was out of building?
3514,Elizabeth,2023-09-19,"Lovely staff Friendly, helpful staff. Some snacks in the room would be appreciated."
3515,Michael,2023-09-19,Very good Location is key Price
3516,Graham,2023-09-19,Good Convenience to airport Better restaurant experience - menu was a bit basic
3517,Peter,2023-09-19,"Convenient The location was perfect and the very early morning breakfast was very convenient for early morning flights. It was disappointing that the free Wi-Fi did NOT have an internet connection, also that one of the bedside cabinets was broken. Not what I expected from a Hampton by Hilton hotel !"
3518,David,2023-09-18,"Very enjoyable, lovely breakfast Very clean & modern Didn‚Äôt expect to walk quite so far from the airport at 1oclock in the morning, but of cause road works need to be done."
3519,Frederic,2023-09-18,Superb  A/c too cold at the restaurant
3520,Bethan,2023-09-18,Great start to the holiday. Great location and early breakfast.
3521,Hugh,2023-09-17,"Great, smart, clean, handy hotel with friendly and professional staff! Good all round! The location is excellent for the airport, it could hardly be easier. The transport options to the airport all worked well without the pressure of an early start in the day if travel. Nothing springs to mind!"
3522,Robert,2023-09-17,Good place to stay before a morning flight from Bristol Large airy bar and restaurant area. Nothing to add
3523,Richard,2023-09-17,"Ideal location and easy to reach from the airport, was somewhat expensive due presumably to this Location ease of booking in and cleanliness of the hotel The shower room had a major issue with the run off to the drain and flooded the bathroom and entrance way to the bedroom area I informed the staff but the problem is obviously due to poor design"
3524,Ed,2023-09-17,Perfect place to stay after a late arrival Very close to arrivals. Bar open late. I think signage via the route to buses is a waste of time for arriving passengers. Survey better to direct left outside arrivals.
3525,Christine,2023-09-17,"Good Have used the hotel since built. Perfect for the airport. The price has virtually doubled. ¬£180 for just one night, booked well in advance is a lot."
3526,Julian,2023-09-17,"Great staff, lovely room. Good bed. Good choice for breakfast. Location. Close to the airport The walk from the airport is a bit of a bomb site"
3527,Ruth,2023-09-17,"Lovely stay Clean & comfortable. Room was spacious. Good breakfast options. A short walk to the airport, very convenient. Buses to/from Bristol & Bath regularly a short walk from the hotel."
3528,Fiona,2023-09-16,Great location if you want to take the stress out of an early flight Location on the airport site as we had an early flight. Staff were friendly and helpful.
3529,Vinny,2023-09-16,"Good Lovely big room, comfortable bed No drinking water in the room Breakfast was very poor, cold plates,bacon and sausage looked boiled ,didn't even bother."
3530,Roland,2023-09-15,OK Reception very helpful for our late at night arrival Windows completely sealed. we wanted some fresh air
3531,Grant,2023-09-14,"Comfortable stay in good location with everything I needed. Having a decent gym with working equipment in good condition was really good. Meal options were fine. Bar comfortable. Male staff member on reception was a bit short with me when I asked about a receipt. He explained I would get it after I checked out as if I should know, I paid a lot of money the day before and needed to claim it back from my employer so it was important to me. I just needed a pleasant explanation."
3532,Thibault,2023-09-13,"The only way to stay near the airport + Location + Quality - Price, is way overpriced"
3533,Becky,2023-09-12,"Good The staff were friendly and helpful. I could share a room with my two daughters, making it more affordable. The room was ideal - clean, well designed and just what we needed. Food was pretty good and amazingly, breakfast was available from 4am so early flights don't have to mean missing breakfast! So super convenient for Bristol Airport - great to be able to walk from the carpark to the hotel and from the hotel to the airport. No complaints - exactly what we needed."
3534,Yoland,2023-09-12,Very good Perfect for what we needed before an early flight. Breakfast service starts early enough for those needing to leave early. Simple but tasty dinner choices.
3535,Helen,2023-09-11,We would stay again but hope for more pillows. Friendly helpful staff. Good size room Lack of pillows!!
3536,Andrew,2023-09-11,"Lovely rooms, great staff, need deep pockets Location was great, apart from the surrounding civil works to improve access, which was difficult to navigate amongst bus queues and barriers. Room was lovely, shame we only spent 4.5 hours in it due to our late arrival, Room not ready due to demand, and a very early departure. Clean and pleasant bar area, staff lovely. Overall pleased with the hotel. Breakfast was basic at the early time we needed to leave for our departure, and there was too little food on display, with no staff around to replenish the food items, mostly run out of choice. For the overnight stay cost, including breakfast, we were very disappointed, and hungry during our day of travel. This was a letdown for us, especially paying ¬£230 for a single night, we expected a better Breakfast experience, and not need to spend more money on food during our travels. Also, drinks in the bar were very expensive, seems a captive audience are charged way over the normal going rate."
3537,Neil,2023-09-11,Superb Location. Cost.
3538,Diane,2023-09-11,Quite a lot of money for a large modern clean soulless room at convenient place for flight The breakfast was it's redeemable feature. I had croissants and fruit and yogurt and coffee. The breakfast was really good quality . Very pleased with the breakfast. It felt more homely and family orientated for the breakfast. A bit more heart and soul. Liked the decor and the happy slogans. It was a bit of a shock that you queued up to place an order for food. As my friend said an expensive MacDonalds. Coincidentally I ended up ordering the burger bun and chips. I felt starving hungry and needed something to fill me up. The burger was really good. So it worked üòÅ. Next time I would know what to expect. Might try another food option. Like the noodles for example. Just was expecting a sit down restaurant with table service like other airport hotels. I thought maybe they had trouble getting staff. The receptionist said there was no proper kitchen on site. Did not really like the atmosphere of the evening dining. Lovely chairs dining area but felt soulless in the evening. The company could have a better chance here to win hearts and minds.
3539,Christine,2023-09-11,Comfortable beds so well rested before a long day of travelling We had an early flight but the Continental breakfast had a good choice of items Separating drinks only from the food ordering queue might have been more efficient
3540,Anne,2023-09-10,Convenient overnight stay for departure flight. Within easy walking distance of airport. Comfortable bed in quiet room with air conditioning. Good breakfast. Evening meal was disappointing. The choice was limited so felt the meals on offer should have been of a higher standard. Curry has small amounts of chicken and no flavour.
3541,Linda,2023-09-10,Very good Beds Quality of jacket potatoes in restaurant
3542,Mike,2023-09-10,"Convenient The location couldn't be better. Enjoyed the curry Building work outside had bad signing, we walked a few hundred yards to go just a few, it was confirmed at reception that a lot of customers had suffered the same, it would have been good if someone had sorted it out so that we could have got there a lot more directly."
3543,Paul,2023-09-10,Superb Location is superb. Breakfast was excellent Could be a better walk way to get to the hotel from the airport
3544,Don,2023-09-09,"Overall our stay was great - but brief as we checked in late afternoon & checked out early next day Nice, clean room, very quiet which was appreciated as we had an early flight on checkout day. Staff were all helpful, courteous, and very good at what they do. Delicious food in the restaurant. And cold beer! Nothing really. Maybe the fact our Uber driver had to pay a fee - which was passed on to us - to drop us at the front entrance of the hotel."
3545,Kenneth,2023-09-08,"Good Quick check in,room had everything you need Bathroom was good,with good shower and toiletries. Great breakfast , good coffee and ample choice. It's the airport,so we know we are going to pay extra for most things,but felt this was taken to extreme. I stayed in a hotel at Heathrow,10 days previously,same company ,but half the price. Also felt bar prices were expensive,pint and gin and tonic 21pounds."
3546,Stacey,2023-09-08,Very good Nice welcome after a delayed flight
3547,Heulwenn,2023-09-08,Very good Easy check in and check out. Some staff were non talkative. Some would also ask you stuff to make conversation and were then very uninterested or wouldn't listen. Took a while to clean up any tables in the evening
3548,Glyn,2023-09-07,Latest stay Location facilities comfort Nothing
3549,Sarah,2023-09-06,"Small room but clean and good breakfast. Great location. Tasty breakfast with a lot of variety. Clean room and nice toiletries in bathroom. Nice and quiet - couldn‚Äôt hear outside noise at all, or other guests. Tiny room and small bed. For travellers arriving with a lot of luggage, as you would expect near an airport, there is next to no space for luggage. We had our daughter with us so the couch was made into a bed so no space in that part of the room for us to put anything. Pillows were very uncomfortable."
3550,Helen,2023-09-06,Very good Location is excellent Rooms are small for a family
3551,Kimberley,2023-09-06,"Good Breakfast was very good, so much variety. Great location for early morning flights with only walking distance to airport"
3552,Francis,2023-09-06,"Good Friendly staff, excellent facilities just a shame I didn't have more time to use them. Very close to the airport so easy for early morning flight. Not being able to sleep for as long."
3553,Christopher,2023-09-06,Great overnight stop for Bristol Airport Perfect location for Bristol Airport Nothing
3554,Sophie,2023-09-05,"Good value for money The room was very beautiful & rustic Italian, it was good value for money & the lady running it sent me a video on how to unlock the door, where the iron was etc & met me in a local restaurant to give me the key While it says private bathroom, this is separate from the room & there is a room in between. Which is fine but may be off putting for others as not clearly described"
3555,Pauline,2023-09-05,We had a very pleasant stay and the hotel is very convenient for the airport the room was large and very comfortable The bed was very comfortable The bathroom with a shower was very clean and spacious. The bar area and area where you order food are combined so when its busy there is a queue.
3556,Debbie,2023-09-05,Short walk from hotel Close to airport expensive for our few hours stay
3557,Raymond,2023-09-04,Very good So conveniently located by the airport and rooms are very comfortable and quiet
3558,Andrew,2023-09-04,Practical but canteen restaurant Close to airport Restaurant was basic for quality hotel
3559,Sara,2023-09-03,Convenient Conveniently located across from the terminal. Breakfast served from 4am. Kind staff. A bit pricy for what it is. Could use a renovation.
3560,Jane,2023-09-03,Very good Convenient for the airport
3561,Susan,2023-09-03,So convenient for airport I would come again. Distance to terminal. Pricey gin and tonic.

3564,Richard,2023-09-01,Expensive Clean and modern Food from restaurant small portions and very expensive
3565,Marina,2023-09-01,Very good  The car park charged me ¬£192 for an overnight stay on my credit card and my debit card. Not happy.
3566,Simon,2023-08-31,Very good Very convenient to the airport and the rooms were very well insulated against noise ( such as aircraft movements) snd lights. Our stay was too short

3571,Hazel,2023-08-30,Excellent for stay. Didn‚Äôt have time for much breakfast! What we had was good. Don‚Äôt know.
3572,Carey,2023-08-30,Very handy for Bristol Airport The closeness to the airport. We could walk from the hotel to the terminal within 5 or so minutes. It was quite a basic hotel and seemed very expensive for the facilities available.
3573,Beth,2023-08-30,"Super convenient for Bristol Airport, bit pricey but can walk to the terminal The shower design was really nice, very modern with quality soap and lotion provided. Lovely touch that they give you a breakfast bag to go if you leave early for a flight before the cooked breakfast starts. The mattress was good, not the most comfy I've ever had at a hotel, but good for the night. The pillows were very nice."
3574,Sonia,2023-08-30,"Nice relaxing way to start a holiday Convenient location to Bristol Airport, great way to start a holiday Limited evening meal menu"
3575,Maire,2023-08-28,An ideal spot for that early morning flight. This hotel is so close to the airport which was ideal for us with an early morning flight. A good choice of food available for the evening and a lovely choice for breakfast the following morning at 4am. The staff were so welcoming and helpful. Nothing.
3576,Julie,2023-08-28,"Great location, care with parking charges! Room was fine and great location for early flight Car parking charges not as advertised and managers attitude when challenged left allot to be desired. Get you don't own car park but don't advertise one rate on website and another at entrance to car park"

3580,Seamus,2023-08-27,Ideal location to airport for early flight Great location from the hotel - literally across the road. Nice early breakfast offering. Quite expensive for basic room but I did book it quite late. Food area was too busy for dinner.
3581,Emma,2023-08-26,"Great for early flights The staff were helpful, the room was great - spacious, well presented and modern, and the restaurant served a good choice of food. Service was good too. I wasn't impressed that I had to pay an additional fee for parking at the hotel. This should be included as part of the room price, as you would expect patrons of the property to be the only ones using the parking available."
3582,Christopher,2023-08-26,"As expected. Nice place to stay. All good, as expected. Clean and spotless. Lovely buffet breakfast. Ideally situated a short walk from the airport."
3583,Martha,2023-08-26,very comfortable beds and helpful staff. the hotel is in a super handy location a very short walk from the airport so is ideal. the prices are rather high I guess it is a captive market.
3584,Doreen,2023-08-26,A comfortable clean room and great location to the airport Location to airport. Able to walk there A little expensive for a single traveler
3585,Lynda,2023-08-26,"Excellent definitely recommend the hotel Early breakfast, 5 o‚Äôclock was more than adequate Nice quiet room Nothing to dislike at all"
3586,Julia,2023-08-24,"We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay and wished we'd got up earlier for a full breakfast. Exceptionally clean, very quiet and the early breakfast was fantastic. The frosted glass on the bathroom door although opaque, still allowed the silhouette image of the person in the bathroom and what they were doing could be seen by occupants in the bedroom."
3587,Krustine,2023-08-23,A comfortable place to rest weary heads üòä Our easy jet flight was cancelled and delayed 12 hrs - last minute booking - met all our needs - we booked in at 2345hrs and left at 0445 - comfortable place to rest weary heads
3588,Pierce,2023-08-22,Adequate Location The system for serving drinks at the bar
3589,Julie,2023-08-21,Convenient overnight stop for early or late flights Our plane was delayed so we were late getting back to Bristol airport and rather than drive 2 hours in the middle of the night we found this hotel a convenient place to stay. Very comfortable bed and nice buffet breakfast. Staff very helpful too. Parking a little expensive but that‚Äôs airport hotels for you...
3590,Robert,2023-08-21,"Superb Great location, close to airport"
3591,Mary,2023-08-21,"Convenient but expensive airport hotel Location is great - a few minutes walk from airport terminal. Room is fine & breakfast ok. The company continues to use feather bedding, which I'm highly allergic to. I noted this when I made the booking & sent a subsequent message on booking.com but received no acknowledgement or response. However reception had a note & checked the bedding was hypoallergenic. So it was resolved BUT it would be much better if the company just stopped using this. I've stayed in many hotels in recent years across Europe, Asia & South America and it seems to be ONLY Hampton & Radisson hotels at UK airports that continue to use feathers & to refuse to put safety of guests first. PLEASE CAN THIS BE REVIEWED. I shouldn't have to make this request when I book at a hotel, especially at the prices charged. I am sure you take other allergies eg. peanuts seriously so it would be much appreciated - & easier for you -if you avoided risks by using the types of bedding now in use at the vast majority of hotels."
3592,Sara,2023-08-21,Clean comfortable and quiet! Location
3593,John,2023-08-20,good for early flight ok so you can get breakfast early but only continental free parking would of been nice
3594,Kylie,2023-08-20,"Great location, very convenient. Extremely comfortable stay before our early morning flight! The location was excellent - very easy for an early flight. We liked everything"
3595,Sian,2023-08-20,Very good Convenient Quite expensive
3596,Simon,2023-08-20,Good 2 min walk to departure. Overpriced
3597,Carol,2023-08-20,Great for an overnight stay Location. Walking distance to airport Limited menu in restaurant/bar
3598,Jayne,2023-08-20,Very convenient stay for airport - peaceful hotel in great location Location for airport Very clean Very quiet Menu choice could be better
3599,Gemma,2023-08-18,Comfortable and practical Perfect location for an early flight I paid double what my travel partner paid
3600,Lawrence,2023-08-18,Very good  Food menu poor and expensive
3601,Julija,2023-08-17,"Very good Location, facilities Price is too expensive"
3602,John,2023-08-17,"Great location, good value for money, helpful and friendly staff Location was excellent, arrival process was seamless, would certainly look at booking again. Nothing"
3603,Jon,2023-08-17,Convenient. Comfortable. Spacious. Clean. Great location for terminal for early morning flight Nothing
3604,Mark,2023-08-16,Easy start to our holiday! Great location. Staff were helpful. The food was expensive and poor quality.
3605,Martyn,2023-08-15,Did the job Functional Impersonal
3606,Lee,2023-08-15,"Very good Location superb,no stress for airport transfer"
3607,Nicola,2023-08-15,Perfect for overnight stay before early morning flight Very helpful reception staff
3608,Mark,2023-08-15,Very handy when you have an early flight The Hotel is on site at the airport so I often use it when I am flying early. Rooms are very nice and modern and exrtemely quiet. Stayed here more that once. Used the restaurant in the evening and breakfast in the morning which starts at 4am. Price is a lot higher than similar hotels (close to ¬£200 a night) but they know you have little other option I suppose. Doesnt stop me using the hotel but the principle bothers me a bit!
3609,Graham,2023-08-15,Ideal location if rather expensive Clean and modern. Ideal location for early flight. Sink and shower drains not flowing well. Reported on departure and sure they will be fixed. Hotel has something of a monopoly for ‚Äúon airport‚Äù location which probably explains rather high cost for very short stay.
3610,Bruce,2023-08-14,"Convenient It was basically an airport transfer hotel and the facilities suitable to cover passenger needs The convenience to the airport although, due to airports ground works we had to walk further than expected"
3611,Mark,2023-08-14,Convenient for airport very friendly and competent staff great breakfast Good breakfast staff very friendly and helpful Could always be cheaper Put times of breakfast and dinner on website
3612,Sally,2023-08-13,"Although we only stayed for 6 hours due to a delayed flight, everything was great! The lady on the desk at 3 in the morning (our plane was severely delayed) was lovely and smiley. The same can be said for the next shift. Breakfast was welcome and good as well as being included within the price. Nothing as far as I can see. The hotel served its purpose for us."
3613,Jonathan,2023-08-12,Flying from Bristol Lots of choice at Breakfast and good quality. Proximity to the airport. Service. Size of the room for a family of three.
3614,Michelle,2023-08-12,Did the job All fine for an airport hotel. Quite pricey.
3615,Susan,2023-08-12,The convenience of the hotel is the reason we choose to stay. I did not have breakfast but it looked very nice. The location is perfect for the Airport I think that the price of a glass of wine is outrageously expensive. I live in Spain and I could buy 6 bottles of wine for the price of one glass at the hotel. Apart from that our stay was very pleasant and was suitable for our onward flight.
3616,John,2023-08-12,I had great relaxing stay and a good night's rest before my early morning jounrey I enjoyed the evening meal Singapore Noodles was delicious. In the morning I had an early flight 7.20 am and found the buffet breakfast was great. It had a wide selection of items and catered to a variety of appetites. Queueing and placing an order at the bar could be improved especially these days if there is an app that can help in both placing and paying for an order. Much like Weatherspoons own app. That said the staff were very helpful and the human interaction was appreciated.
3617,Anne,2023-08-11,Perfect for an airport stop over Location to airport! Nothing
3618,Hannah,2023-08-11,"good booking in , airport , staff very helpful and always straightforward to check in and out always find it over priced for what it is"
3619,Julian,2023-08-10,Fantastic welcome at the front desk and clean and comfy room next to the airport. The location to the airport is perfect. The room was clean and modern. The weclome by Alex on the front desk was as welcoming as you could get and really informative. Lovely guy. A little bit pricey but you pay for the location and quality of hotel. It was worth it.
3620,Kathryn,2023-08-10,Very comfortable but would not normally pay this rate for a hotel. Purely because of location. Staff on reception very pleasant and helpful Very expensive
3621,Susan,2023-08-10,Stayed to be close to airport & went well Nice choice & good that it's included.
3622,Ruth,2023-08-10,"Always a pleasant stay, just need to adresss the bar area. The location. Right across the road from airport. Stayed here many times and still the queue at the bar to order drinks and food is ridiculous, up to 30 minute wait they need to come up with a new system."
3623,Cathleen,2023-08-10,Great for an overnight transit 250m walk to the airport which is great for an early flight and the room was very comfortable Nothing
3624,Katie,2023-08-09,"Convenient for airport stop over Easy access from airport, quiet Our room was far too small for 3 people - no space for luggage and very little space round bed to walk"
3625,Bridie,2023-08-09,"Comfortable, modern, relaxing Close proximity to the airport. Nice and modern, friendly staff. That you can‚Äôt use cash. Cash is legal tender."
3626,Samantha,2023-08-08,You feel like you're on holiday as soon as you step inside! Comfortable rooms and delicious breakfast. Super convenient for the airport. It's a little pricey and a bath would be good.
3627,Ann,2023-08-08,Excellent for overnight airport hotel Well placed for airport and bus station and very comfortable beds No usb charging points
3628,Chris,2023-08-08,Very good How clean the room was and how big it was for the money. Good sized sofa in room An airport hotel people use to catch early flights but they don't serve hot breakfast until 0600
3629,Lucy,2023-08-08,Very good Spacious and clean Staff very friendly and helpful Windows faced other rooms. This meant curtains had to be drawn almost always
3630,Mary,2023-08-07,Overall as expected and ideal location Location ideal for an early flight. The staff were very helpful especially at checkout when I experienced difficulty in finding a trolley as I had a lot of luggage. The receptionist went above and beyond to help me. It was quite pricey for the type of accommodation
3631,Jeremy,2023-08-07,Very good Clean and comfortable and close to check in for early morning flight.
3632,Neil,2023-08-06,"Convenient, very good quality hotel within 100m of the arrivals gate Great location. VERY quiet in spite of being on the airport. Good cooked breakfast buffet. Friendly late night reception staff. Nothing."
3633,Elaine,2023-08-06,"Perfect for a late flight home Convenient to the airport The sofa bed was very difficult to get in and out of, due to the metal frame protruding from the bed. Very easy to catch your leg"
3634,Thomas,2023-08-06,Convenient Convenient Nothing
3635,Arthur,2023-08-06,Good all round hotel shame about additional parking charge Breakfast was great room was excellent although a little pricey very close to airport which we could walk to Extra cost of ¬£14.00 to park the car overnight
3636,Lynn,2023-08-05,Chose the hotel because of location for early flight. Met all expeditions and standards very good. Close to airport. Staff at Reception exceptional. Alex and Tom.
3637,Theresa,2023-08-05,Enjoyed the comfort of the room and the pillows were wonderful to sleep on . Quick and easy access from the airport. Lovely comfortable beds and lovely bathroom. We were very disappointed that there were no face flannels in our bathroom. We had to wash with the corner of one of the hand towels. We were amazed that there was a carpenter doing work in the sitting area of the restaurant when we went down to breakfast in the morning. Didn‚Äôt expect to have to listen to someone banging into the seat frames that he was installing in the seating area of the restaurant. Also we thought that the ¬£14.50 parking charges were extortionate just for 1 nights parking. We didn‚Äôt check in to the hotel until the early hours of the morning.
3638,Margaret,2023-08-04,Comfortable and convenientl for airport Staff were helpful & friendly. Room was clean & comfortable. Breakfast was perfect for an early morning start Nothing
3639,Mark,2023-08-04,Recommended. Close proximity to the airport. Within walking distance. Excellent staff all round. The choice of food. But this is a minor gripe.
3640,Moira,2023-08-04,"Very good Very comfortable rooms. Accessible room with the adjoining room was perfect for our needs Breakfast was a little disappointing - it seemed like a good range but toaster didn't toast properly, horrible scrambled eggs, syrup for waffles didn't flow etc etc"
3641,Robert,2023-08-03,Was short stay but staff and presentation was very good Room very clean and look good well presented. Bed was nice and comfortable with lovely bedding. Breakfast was nice and tasty with plenty of choice. There was nothing I disliked
3642,Rebecca,2023-08-03,Very good Very clean and tidy Great location for airport departure and arrival Choice at breakfast was v v good Quietness of rooms Shower was Lovley and nice shower gel and hand soap Just thought the parking could have been included in the price
3643,Charlotte,2023-08-01,Very good Location and staff excellent. Rooms very clean and spacious. Pillows are awful!
3644,Paul,2023-08-01,No nonsense and a step from departure gates Location!! Utilitarian
3645,Laura,2023-08-01,Delivered where easyJet failed! Needed a room for the night after flight was cancelled. Being right at the airport it was convenient. Room was clean comfortable and welcomed after sitting in the airport for hours. Reception staff were patient and helpful with myself and the rest of the weary and disgruntled easyJet customers. Nothing. The hotel was great.
3646,Paul,2023-08-01,"excellent all round modern, clean, good food and drink and excellent staff could have done with spare pillows in rooms"
3647,Gerry,2023-08-01,"Very good Location, breakfast , quiet room"
3648,Anna,2023-07-31,"Location is good, but... It is SO convenient to be able to walk to the terminal if you're dropping someone off for a 4am check-in. The food is not great. Breakfast was especially disappointing - really terrible coffee, no bacon, rock hard (yesterdays?) croissants. At almost ¬£200 a night for B&B, it was a shock to then also pay ¬£14 for overnight parking (reduced from ¬£45!!)."
3649,Gavin,2023-07-30,"The perfect stay over before an early flight! Location, comfort of the room and the quality of the food. The coffee at breakfast. I‚Äôd be prepared to pay more for a proper espresso!"
3650,Sarah,2023-07-30,"Good Stayed the night before an early morning departure. Easy to find on arrival to the airport via taxi. We didn't eat at the restaurant for dinner. Check in process was relatively straightforward. Staff at checkin and checkout were very helpful. Breakfast was served from early in the morning which was great and plenty of choice and food for everyone. No queues at the bar or restaurant at breakfast. The room was very quiet and couldn't hear any plane noise or people moving about in the corridors or rooms which was great. Would recommend to anyone with an early flight and that doesn't want the hassle of Bristol traffic in the morning The bar staff were disorganised - couldn't find items on the till, didn't seem to know their drinks menu, randomly selecting sizes of drinks etc. But overall the stay was good."
3651,Johnston,2023-07-30,Staff always friendly and welcoming. Hotel facilities always to high standard Location ideal for stay over for early flight. Access to parking and airport within easy walking distance All good
3652,Matthew,2023-07-30,"Nice hotel but got locked in the bathroom Great location, I like that we could get breakfast very early. The lock on the bathroom door didn't work properly. I got locked in the bathroom and couldn't get out. The door locked but I couldn't unlock it. Luckily my wife was able to open the door from the outside, but I'm not sure I would have got out if I had been travelling alone."
3653,Catherine,2023-07-30,Perfect for airport stay Location excellent for airport Breakfast is very tired. Needs fresh products.
3654,Anna,2023-07-30,Superb Near airport

3657,Lorna,2023-07-28,Pleasant nice food Booking in Very bad smell in first room had to move
3658,La,2023-07-28,A good night's sleep The location is the best bit about the hotel. I stay here every time I fly into Bristol airport. It's so convenient. A good night's sleep is certain in the hotel. The staff are friendly. No. It was all good.
3659,Julia,2023-07-28,"Very good The room,the staff, lovely big shower very comfortable. Restaurant lovely the breakfast superb. I didn't like the fact that although reception were aware of needing assistance from airport staff to collect me I had to keep pestering them to give me an answer from assistance and they arrived at least an hour late.also couldn't get TV to work with remote that was there.also an alarm went off at 3 a.m and reception brought in a ladder to sort it .apart from was ok"
3660,Paul,2023-07-27,Superb Short 5m walk from airport .Efficient and friendly check in check out .Nice room and big shower.Late night supper was good and breakfast very good .large car park . Nothing

3662,Hector,2023-07-26,Very good  Doors bang shut if not careful and therefore noisy
3663,Bcn,2023-07-26,"Good location for the airport The location was good as we were meeting a friend flying in to the airport. It was an hour drive to the Cotswolds which we planned to explore. I found the hotel very overpriced. It was one of the most expensive hotels on our trip and was nothing extraordinary. There was a big variety of food at the breakfast. The room was ok, nothing special. The staff were fairly friendly but nothing special either."
3664,Penny,2023-07-26,Great hotel with the loveliest staff Great location and great facilities. The gentleman at the reception was exceptionally helpful and considerate of our needs as a big family; it was clear he went above and beyond to ensure our rooms were as close together as possible. My sibling was also offered an emergency dental kit when they forgot to pack their toothbrush. It was a lovely stay all in all. It‚Äôs a shame there‚Äôs no hot breakfast until 6AM and we had to leave before that. The continental breakfast available was lovely though.
3665,Amy,2023-07-25,"Only stayed for 1 night but it was comfortable Breakfast was nice, good selection. Nice size bed. Cleanliness needs a little attentive to the shower."
3666,Rodney,2023-07-25,Superb Everything Menu
3667,Joanne,2023-07-24,Bit pricey but for location standard of rooms can‚Äôt be faulted Close to departures nice friendly staff
3668,Joe,2023-07-24,"Facilities really nice, food terrible and price very expensive for just the night. Room was big, clean and was no noise. Good wasn‚Äôt the best, me and girlfriend had food night before there wasn‚Äôt many gluten free options for her and my meal was very bad had a burger and might be one of the worst ones I‚Äôve ever had, breakfast in the morning was ok, for the price of one night staying there I would think the food would be much better and night time food wasn‚Äôt included so had to pay for that."
3669,Rachid,2023-07-24,Very good Praticable for an early flight Parking
3670,Colm,2023-07-23,"Nothing too exciting but nice staff and food was fairly decent. General airport hotel style., ie bland. I was VERY disappointed that we had to pay extra for parking for 1 night after already paying an extra ¬£20 for my dog that slept on the floor"

3676,Guy,2023-07-21,"An overpriced airport hotel for an overnight stay! Basic accommodation but lovely staff! It is functional but totally overpriced! As an airport hotel, the staff are extremely helpful. The parking charges for leaving car overnight before departing from Bristol airport are outrageous. Parking charges in hotel car park. Basic accommodation. Cleanliness needs improving."
3677,Johnny,2023-07-20,Did the job well. Near airport Not have a small cooler/fridge
3678,Jenny,2023-07-20,It‚Äôs ok but could do better Lovely styled hotel. Great location for airport Food menu really poor. Staff were slow at serving.

3680,Wendy,2023-07-19,"Very comfortable, convenient stay. Excellent choice of continental breakfast for 4 a.m. start! Staff very efficient and helpful. Morning call delivered as arranged. (Very important) Location of hotel ideal for our needs. Very comfortable beds with ‚Äòdown‚Äô filled pillows. Car parking would be expensive for long stay."
3681,Ian,2023-07-19,Take off from Bristol Airport Breakfast Room Location perfect for Bristol Airport
3682,Wilkins,2023-07-19,"Lovely but slightly marred by my cut thumb.= The beds were the most memorable. Very comfortable, good quality bedding and a lovely nights sleep. The restaurant. We enjoyed the basic menu and the setting with the lovely bar. However, the cleaning left a lot to be desired as I cut my right thumb on a sharp piece of glass that was down the seam of my seat. I ran my hand down the seam and felt a sharp sting. I reported to the staff and they filled out an accident report and provided me with blue plaster and antiseptic spray. They apologised, removed the glass but didnt even offer a glass of wine by way of apology."
3683,Glen,2023-07-19,Great location food was good bed was hard drinks expensive taxi‚Äôs extortionate Located on the airport Bed was hard Drinks were expensive Taxi to other venues were extortionate

3694,Wish,2023-07-12,"My Stay at Hilton Enjoy this Hotel as was very convenient & close to the airport. Perfect location. Hotel itself was very clean and modern. The room itself was great as it had everything u need. Very comfortable bed and nice bathroom. No noise of the airport which was a bonus. Also the staff where Friendly and kindly hold are luggage for us so could have a day out in Bristol. I sorry to say that theirs a few things that disappointed me. One was the cost of the room for one night ¬£175 which is expensive. Another thing that wasn't the best is the breakfast, I was so disappointed with it, considering what I paid. The full English was a big disappointment, no fry eggs, sausage where discussing, so was the scrambled eggs, bread too. Also the coffee was out of a machine, I could go on. Please sort it out, I wanted to complain but didn't have time as had to go."
3695,David,2023-07-12,Did the job but no great experience Convenient for airport and advance check in of luggage Early morning departure. At 4am no coffee unless paid for despite breakfast included in price. Flight departure at 6.30 meant no time to have anything.
3696,Helen,2023-07-11,"This hotel seemed less good than on previous stays while the price had increased. Pleasant room, comfortable and very convenient location. Great that they have provision for a help yourself continental breakfast for those who have to leave very early to catch a flight but the choice was limited. Evening meal quality was very poor with limited choice and smallish portions for the price. Continental buffet breakfast could be improved. Even though we were very early the fresh fruit platter was finished and had not been replenished.Generally there was limited choice."
3697,John,2023-07-11,"Excellent place to stay for an early flight. Staff could not have been more friendly. Nice clean comfortable room, decen Less than 5 minute walk to airport"

Breakfast was great, wide choice of food including vegetarian and vegan options. Room was good but the bed was far too firm. Bathroom was good. Super convenient for getting to the airport terminal, which is why you stay there! Bed was far too firm."

3703,Catherine,2023-07-11,Room good restaurant more like a mid level cafe Convenience to airport. Easy walk Ripoff parking charges. Not even a drop off point for luggage. A ¬£7 parking fee for 20 minutes unloading and getting into our room before taking the rental car back is beyond a joke.

3705,Steven,2023-07-09,Good Location to air port Drinks to expensive
3706,Emma,2023-07-09,"Superb The staff at this hotel were absolutely faultless. I arrived after a long journey and they were very friendly and welcoming, which was a huge relief as I was travelling alone. The room was spotless and spacious and the breakfast offering was fresh and tasty. The price! It is such a convenient location when flying from Bristol, but it is overpriced for what it is and that is the only thing that puts me off returning."
3707,Davina,2023-07-09,Very good Bedrooms quiet which is important when you have to get up early for flight A bottle of water in room would be nice
3708,Natalie,2023-07-08,Pleasant and happy stay Gym facilities and very modern throughout. Couldn‚Äôt hear the aeroplanes Pillows weren‚Äôt very comfortable Tv didn‚Äôt have Netflix
3709,Catherine,2023-07-08,Very comfortable hotel but expensive. Very comfortable and quiet rooms. Restaurant was good and affordable. Convenient location. It‚Äôs very expensive for what it is. You are paying for the convenience of being located on the airport. Only you can decide if it is worth it. I had an early flight so the extra sleep and less stress was worth it this time but if I had a flight at a reasonable time I wouldn‚Äôt consider it.
3710,Dawn,2023-07-08,"Served it‚Äôs purpose well Location, ease of getting to departure terminal, food was ok with multiple options depending on time of day, rooms clean, email communication was quick Originally rang the venue to ask a question about booking in times as had had a flight cancelled at Gatwick so would be arriving very late, receptionist couldn‚Äôt answer the simple question of if they operated a 24 hour booking in desk? And after being put on hold for ages the call was disconnected, as I was already in a very stressful situation this wasn‚Äôt good"
3711,Jane,2023-07-08,"Makes an early start at Bristol Airport more bearable. Location next to terminal, size of room comfortable bed, quiet. Helpful staff. Departures listed and updated in hotel No flannels in the bathroom. Tea & coffee limited (no biscuits which would have been nice)"
3712,Kay,2023-07-07,Alright We ate in the restaurant but was very ordinary The plug sockets on the head board didn‚Äôt work
3713,Cherry,2023-07-07,Comfortable clean stay between flights. Excellent receptionist Proximity to airport Nothing
3714,Alison,2023-07-07,Very good Chose the hotel due to early flight from Bristol Airport. Can't get any closer than over the road! The cost is a little high for twin room overnight stay as you can't check in before 15.00 and we were out of the room by 4.30 am. 15.00 check in is a bit of a pain. Would be better with an option for an earlier check in.
3715,William,2023-07-07,Smart modern hotel Smart hotel in the perfect location Price!
3716,Marilyn,2023-07-06,"Not a cheap 1-night stay but well worth it for the great location & high standard of facilities Very helpful, friendly staff, great food selection at breakfast, lunch & dinner, so handy for accessing Bristol airport - just a short stroll to check-in. Lovely fresh decor in all areas and good-sized rooms. The option of a ground-floor room was a real bonus when travelling with heavy luggage. Room felt quite cold and I was unable to adjust the temperature. Not sure if I was having a 'senior moment' and not pressing the right buttons, but an instruction card for adjusting the heating would have been useful."
3717,James,2023-07-05,"Quick Didn‚Äôt have breakfast as flight was 6 o‚Äôclock in the morning. Due to delay only had room for one hour, so quick shower then back to the airport. No delays on flight from Edinburgh."
3718,Ashley,2023-07-05,"Value, efficiency and convenient.I would have no hesitation to stay again in future Proximity to airport after a late flight Breakfast ..... produce okay but not a fan of cafeteria style"
3719,Frances,2023-07-05,"Convenient and comfortable Convenient location for our needs. Room was big enough, clean and comfortable. Staff very welcoming and friendly. Nothing to dislike."
3720,Paul,2023-07-04,"Good pre-flight stop over, comfy bed, slept well :) Everything about the hotel optimised for easy air travel which is perfect. Little bit basic in terms of facilities, but to be honest given target market is basically people sleeping before they fly, I think that‚Äôs the right call."
3721,Mary,2023-07-04,"Superb We had a late flight into the airport so decided to stay over and drive home in the morning. Really glad we did. Room was comfortable, breakfast was good and the walk from the terminal was really short"
3722,Graham,2023-07-03,"Perfect location, great staff, but quality didn‚Äôt match price. Check in, staff friendly. Breakfast was good and so was the supper. When curtains closed in our room you had to put a light on. When sleeping it meant leaving a light on but none were dimmed enough not to keep us awake. The giant mirror in front of the bathroom door reflected the light throughout the room. That comment was for what we didn‚Äôt like. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. The bar area had seats which had had their cushions removed so we‚Äôre unusable."
3723,Liz,2023-07-03,"Good Room was very nice, bigger and brighter than I expected. Super handy for the airport, a three minute walk which was brilliant. Breakfast was okay."
3724,Mjbentley,2023-07-02,Surprising comfortable airport hotel ! Very efficient check in and comfortable rooms for an airport hotel. Very quiet! Food ....again efficient and above normal standards for an airport hotel. No decent decaf coffee!! Bar set up late at night needs attention. Quite a few people were waiting a long time for drinks.
3725,Elizabeth,2023-07-02,Very good All was good
3726,Sandra,2023-07-02,"Very good Fantastic for air travel being on the airport door step. We had only two teabags and two coffees and only a sweetner instead of sugar, for the money we paid i don't think it'd hurt to be a little more generous. We did an overnight for flight the next day and had no tea or coffee after break"
3727,Peter,2023-07-02,"Excellent accommodation for early morning flight, no worries of traffic jams! Location Nothing"
3728,Russell,2023-07-02,Good Close to airport
3729,David,2023-07-02,I would book again. Quiet and clean Poor ventilation in the bathroom and the water noises from above the room
3730,Annette,2023-07-02,Very good  Bed was too hard and could have benefitted from a memory foam mattress
3731,Virginia,2023-07-01,Great location Location in airport for early flight Breakfast included in stay The hamburger I had was awful
3732,Catherine,2023-07-01,"Very convenient for the airport terminals Great location, right next to the airport terminal Expensive rooms"
3733,Gary,2023-06-30,Would be happy to stay there again. Modern and the location. Excellent breakfast and staff working to provide it. Room doors have a tendency to slam shut. Rather disturbing.
3734,Stephen,2023-06-30,Very good  The sausages weren‚Äôt as good as last time tasted different
3735,Vera,2023-06-30,Recommended Spotless. Rooms nicely equipped. Breakfast that starts at 04:00 is great to catch early planes. No mini fridge in the room.
3736,Matthew,2023-06-29,"Used as like everyone else as there‚Äôs little alternative at airport Only picked due to location to airport and early flight Small room , well used room needs updating."
3737,Christopher,2023-06-29,"Like i said room and staff were good ,not the evening food/ The room was good ,location good. The breakfast was good but the evening food not good"
3738,Heather,2023-06-29,Check in was fast and efficient. No table service for bar/food but staff friendly. The location was perfect. The cost of the room was on the pricey side but I guess this is because you have a monopoly.
3739,Tracy,2023-06-29,Convenient Location. Short walk to terminal
3740,Alan,2023-06-28,"Good spot on the airport,clean rooms but disappointed in the breakfast, not value for money. The room was fine but the breakfast was 2nd rate,it starts off with good food and then it is let down by the cooking. The breakfast it was so second rate."
3741,Paul,2023-06-28,"Super, convenient hotel. Very clean hotel. The room was spacious and quiet. Bed was comfortable. Staff were friendly and attentive. We only used the room for a few hours due to arriving at the airport in the early hours and then travelling onward. Didn't get chance to have the breakfast. The experience in booking was very easy online and was easy to amend after an error on my part on booking the wrong day!! More milk in the rooms, please. Could breakfast run a little longer? We arrived at 4am and were very tired after an eight hour journey back to the UK. It was not possible to get down to eat in time."
3742,Paul,2023-06-28,"Hotel overnight visit Closeness to airport terminal Would have liked a hot breakfast, but due to our flight time only continental offered."
3743,Sandra,2023-06-28,"Very good The location is perfect, the staff were very helpful, the rooms are extremely comfortable, thank you I would have liked more choice of breakfast, there were few bananas, please have more next time"
3744,Jean,2023-06-27,Superb Great location
3745,Amanda,2023-06-27,Great as a stopover before you fly Location Nothing
3746,Lloyd,2023-06-27,"Excellent, brilliant location for late trips into the airport.  Shower difficult to obtain a good consistent temperature"
3747,Ian,2023-06-26,Good place to stay before an early flight. Very handy for the airport and helpful that they offer free parking while checking in and dropping luggage (we were parking at the Silver Zone park). As we had an early check-in for our flight we thought we would have to miss breakfast so were pleasantly surprised by the early continental breakfast available.
3748,Isabel,2023-06-26,"Superb The hotel is right next to the national Express bus stop and to the airport yet we didn't hear any noise whilst we were trying to sleep. The staff were very friendly. The room was spotless, shower was amazing. They also had a selection of games in the lounge area such as 'guess who' and 'battleships'. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The 'on the go' breakfast is NOT very good. It contained an apple, a cereal bar and a croissant. Considering you have breakfast included in the price and no option to remove it, I would consider a better 'on the go' breakfast for people who have early flights. For example, we had to leave the hotel at 4am and the hot breakfast doesn't start until 6/7am. A cold bacon/sandwich sandwich would have been better than a croissant in our opinion."
3749,Kingsley,2023-06-26,Very good This is the perfect stopover for flights that are either late getting in or early morning. It is right next to the terminal and far exceeded my expectation both with the staff and the facilities.
3750,Sue,2023-06-24,Have to stay here as no other alternative but very expensive although comfortable. location to airport after late flight. ¬£160 and no water in room. Checking in at 0200 and receptionist more interested in offering us 10% off our next visit. We were tired! No fried eggs at breakfast and not available. Both coffee machines not working properly at breakfast. Can‚Äôt offer a parking deal as spaces owned by Bristol airport so whole thing very expensive.
3751,Andrew,2023-06-24,Excellent Excellent breakfast. Reduce room price per night
3752,Emma,2023-06-24,It was good apart from no breakfast Could not have any as flying out early. That I paid for breakfast included in the price but you could not provide a cooked breakfast before my early flight. Breakfast should be optional extra in the price as I paid for something that wasn't possible to have.
3753,Elaine,2023-06-23,"My flight arrived quite late in the evening so it was suitable for that situation. Room was very nice, clean and cool. Very nice helpful staff. Being old I struggled with the journey from terminal to hotel on foot with luggage. Food and drink prices very high and too much self service, given the prices."
3754,Claire,2023-06-22,Friendly staff and close to the airport proximity to airport restaurant and bar area drinks were expensive
3755,Lara,2023-06-22,Great nights sleep Very clean and comfortable
3756,Sara,2023-06-21,"expensive but convenient on airport site bedroom far to small, food average, drinks extortionate"
3757,Steven,2023-06-21,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
3758,Karen,2023-06-21,"Very good It was OK for 4am. An omelette would have been nice, not just coisonts and cereals"
3759,Sarah,2023-06-21,"warm, friendly and welcoming the rooms were clean, tidy and spacious enough the showers didn‚Äôt have a bath but were still big enough."
3760,Kathryn,2023-06-21,convenient when you have an early flight close to airport
3761,Jean-pierre,2023-06-20,"if food is improved, this will be a much better hotel overall room was practical and clean quality and choice of food was poor"
3762,Michele,2023-06-20,Unexpected Breakfast fab plenty of choice It was fine bit costly
3763,Catherine,2023-06-20,"Curate's egg The room was very comfortable and clean. The toiletries in the bathroom were lovely, and the towels were good. The continental breakfast was very poor. The ""orange juice"" was orange squash, there was hardly any food, and the tea was awful. I think perhaps the machine needed properly cleaned."
3764,Yacht-surveyor,2023-06-20,good for an early flight The location is great but you get wet going to and from the terminal if its raining too expensive
3765,Chris,2023-06-20,"overnight stay before early flight, very comfy night! very modern look about the place. upto dare decor. evening meal was excellent."
3766,Paul,2023-06-20,perfect for early flights super convenient for the airport. the staff were so friendly and helpful
3767,Sharon,2023-06-19,"stayed here after flight cancelled, definitely not worth the ¬£220 for one night stay for solo traveler, location to airport very clean helping courteous staff the price way too expensive"
3768,Stephen,2023-06-19,Superb Did what it ment to for us. Nothing
3769,Jessica,2023-06-19,"Just across the airport, a great gym and breakfast buffet to enjoy before heading for the next stop Very short walking distance from the airport and a great gym--they had a Peloton! A bit pricey but you are paying for the convenient location so close to the airport"
3770,Louise,2023-06-18,Very expensive this year Convenience Restaurant sub standard and low quality. Menu has been the same for years. We always plan to not eat there but tiredness after travelling means we end up eating there.
3771,Su,2023-06-18,relaxed and comfortable. staff were helpful and friendly close to terminal. clean. helpful staff
3772,Gareth,2023-06-17,Very good Very convenient from Bristol Airport for a place to stay late at night after a flight from Barcelona. Saved driving straight home. Room nice and Clean. Breakfast was very tasty.
3773,Geraldine,2023-06-17,very satisfied Th√© atmosphere in the hotel was relaxed but efficient. all the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful
3774,Rowan,2023-06-17,A good stay The proximity to Bristol Airport. was excellent. An easy check-in and good breakfast. The room was average sized and very clean. We were happy with the room Everything was good and no surprises.
3775,Glenn,2023-06-16,Good in parts Room and airport was good quick & easy access room was l9vely & comfortable and clean. Breakfast in a bag was poor not much food choice on evening menu plus not accepting cash card only.
3776,Sarah,2023-06-16,"Great staff and comfort - But the price is just robbery. I stay here every 12 weeks as I have an early flight to travel to work. As usual, the staff, comfort and cleanliness is great. It‚Äôs also very convenient having a place to get a drink and a meal on site. THE PRICE! It‚Äôs just absolute lunacy! ¬£220 for one night B & B. I know market drivers etc. but there no need to fleece your customers. Unfortunately for us customers there aren‚Äôt really any compatible viable options in the locality."
3777,Ernest,2023-06-16,It did what we wanted. Did not use the breakfast. Room overlooked the dirty washing store.
3778,Linda,2023-06-16,"Will be booking again next year Excellent location as we had an early flight and very short distance to the departure area. The continental breakfast was good Not being able to be dropped off by the entrance to the hotel, it was a mad scramble to get out of the car at the roadside and we couldn't say goodbye properly to my husband .You have to pay an exorbitant fee to park for a few minutes"
3779,Julie,2023-06-15,Great location right next to the terminal buildings. The location is amazing! The breakfast was superb! The windows don't open in the rooms. The rooms are small. Could have been a bit cleaner - bleach will take care of mould straight away!
3780,Jill,2023-06-15,Comfortable stay but felt it was a bit overpriced Location excellent for the airport. Good bus service from centre of Bristol.
3781,Anthony,2023-06-15,All good - need invoice sent to me please Location and food Fire alarm and evacuation at 4am
3782,Gary,2023-06-15,good Closeness to airport
3783,Matthew,2023-06-15,Overnight airport hotel stay in Bristol Clean and comfortable. What is expected from a Hilton hotel. Very early breakfast (as of 4am) - perfect for early travellers. 10 minutes walk to Bristol Airport. A more varied menu choice from hotel restaurant. Dining area just next to main reception and it looked very busy to me.
3784,Stephen,2023-06-15,Thank you very much to all the staff at the Hampton by Hilton Everything was good the staff were really friendly and helpful the breakfast was good the room was clean we will be staying with you again thank you üòÄ
3785,Jodi,2023-06-15,"Convienient, comfortable and a great breakfast. Very close to the terminal. Nice room, bathroom, tv, sofa. Good wifi. Free, unlimited brekkie was excellent with lots of choices - just make sure you get there before it closes."
3786,Peter,2023-06-14,"Good hotel, very convenient location, and you have to pay for that. The hotel is very convenient for a very early departure time from the airport (we live two hours drive away). The welcome was very friendly, and it was easy to find our way around. It‚Äôs also very quiet. It‚Äôs an expensive stay (¬£200 for the night), but the only hotel that allows you to walk to the airport departure gates."
3787,Amanda,2023-06-14,For a last minute change to my plans it was a good place to stay This was a last minute booking as was supposed to fly out the same day but things didn't go to plan and I needed somewhere to stay for the night. The room was lovely; the staff were excellent and very helpful; and the food (both evening and breakfast) were to a high standard. I have to admit that I don't stay in hotels and the price did seem excessive- until I got there and actually saw the place. It was still expensive but I could see why.
3788,Geraldine,2023-06-13,"very convenient but expensive for a v short night proximity to airport I chose to book a room through the app, and get a digital key. reception then said they need to change my room. digital key arrived 90mins after I got into the room"

3790,Lauren,2023-06-13,"Good for being close to the airport Great location close to the airport. The hallways need the windows open, very hot walking up to our room carrying heavy luggage. The pillows are rubbish, not a very comfy night sleep with the pillows"

3792,John,2023-06-13,"Very pleased with our first stay at this hotel and will use again. Conveniently located to the bus stop and the Airport's departure entrance point. Room was clean with comfortable bedding. Excellent toilet/shower facilities. A good selection of cooked and continental breakfasts were available together with fruit juices/tea/coffee, etc. Very pleasant and helpful Reception Staff. Not much ....but the climb from the Hotel to the Airport's Departure point proved to be a bit of a challenge to my ageing legs."
3793,Amy,2023-06-13,"Quick stop over Right on airport, lovely staff, quiet rooms, and great breakfast options for earlier check outs. Our bathroom was an assessible bathroom, which I wouldn't really mind, but the water wasn't draining properly, and it seeped out of the bathroom. Bar meals a little basic."
3794,Laura,2023-06-13,"Great location, attentive and friendly staff and excellent buffet breakfast. Recommended Hotel easily accessed from Bristol Airport, even with suitcases/prams down the accessible slopes. Staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. We arrived at 12.30am and requested a cot. Two staff members met us when we arrived at the room and set it up very quickly so we could get the kids to bed. Room and rest of hotel was clean and tidy. The breakfast buffet included in the price the next morning was excellent. Great selection and coffee was good quality. Hilton Honours allowed us to extend checkout until 2pm for free, which was great as our flight wasn't until 3.30pm. Once we made the pull-out bed back into a sofa, the room was sufficient size for us to stay in for a few hours. Overall great stay, would highly recommend. We were a family of 4 (2 adults and 1 child and 1 infant), so selected a Queen room with pull out bed and cot. Room was a little snug once the pull out bed and cot were out, but this was fine for a 1 night stay. The next day we folded the bed back to a sofa which gave us enough room."

3806,Aileen,2023-06-09,"Over priced Perfectly situated right beside the terminal building with covered walkway for some of the way . Clean , comfortable and everything you need for an airport stay . The cost was ridiculous . Overpriced and taking advantage of the monopoly they have at this airport . We arrived at 1230am were up at 5 and it cost ¬£220 ."

3811,Deborah,2023-06-07,"Excellent location, comfort and service. Very comfortable beds which were hugely appreciated after a very long day travelling, and arriving at 3 am. Good blackout so not disturbed in the morning, and able to check out at 12 rather than 11 am. Excellent breakfast, very relaxed environment. Although it seemed expensive the convenience adjacent to the airport and the comfort offered made it worthwhile. Reception was a little slow, as the receptionist was perhaps inexperienced and needed assistance with the guests ahead of us. This was frustrating for us as we were desperate to get to our room!"
3812,Martha,2023-06-07,"a relaxing nights sleep after a late flight The location within walking distance to the airport is super handy. the room was very clean, beds very comfy, shower good. breakfast could have had a few more choices eg fried eggs, more pastry items like pan au chocolate (considering the price).

3816,James,2023-06-05,"Very good Really convenient, especially booking bags in the night before. Good room soundproofing key when people are getting up from 4am. ¬£200 a night was expensive for effectively a slight nicer travel lodge"

3827,Leanne,2023-06-02,"great for an over night stay. this hotel is ideally situated directly opposite the airport, with a path to access steps up to the Main entrance. it was perfect for one night stay over for an early flight. with a continental breakfast available from 4am, it‚Äôs brillant to grab and go. room was clean and spacious, we had the sofa bed prepare for our young son, it was perfect for him, but for and adult it would have been very uncomfortable. we hardly heard a sound from runway and had a good nights sleep. staff were very friendly and helpful, we arrived late, exhausted and grateful swift checking. the bed, now don‚Äôt get wrong we slept, but the bed felt very unstable and bumpy"
3828,Colin,2023-06-02,"Ideal for our needs with an early morning flight. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the airport terminal (up hill, although I understand there is a bus service if needed). Check in was quick and efficient, our room was clean and suited our needs. As we had an early flight the continental breakfast was welcome and had good choices, the hot food starts at 6am."

3834,Louise,2023-05-31,it was very convenient for us as we had a early flight right nxt to airport the food was basic ‚Ä¶ not a lot of choice ..
3835,Edward,2023-05-31,Convenient for Airport Convenient location for Airport
3836,Janet,2023-05-31,As a couple it‚Äôs pleasant but taking a grandchild to stay in the room too space becomes too compressed airport access proximity Sink layout too far away for a tall five year old to use without being lifted up plus room size when sofa bed made up isn‚Äôt good
3837,Beverley,2023-05-30,Good Liked how close to the airport it is and the facilities available. I thought a lot of the things where over priced for quantity especially the parking which I know is owned by the airport unfortunately and of I I'd known this before hand I would of added the extra day on the airport parking
3838,Margaret,2023-05-30,Flying visit! Excellent location for the airport We spent less than 12 hours in the hotel because we arrived late one evening for a very early flight the next day. However it served its purpose well and could not have been nearer the airport. We even had a grab and go breakfast at 4am nothing
3839,Ian,2023-05-30,Very good close to airport nothing not to like
3840,Colin,2023-05-30,Superb Airport

3847,Vikki,2023-05-27,Very good Room was great. Comfy bed. Right next to the airport and no hassle parking Evening meal menu very poor. Very little choice.
3848,Paula,2023-05-27,Perfect place if arriving late or leaving early on a flight Location to airport Friendly staff Small room and bathroom - especially for the price Average breakfast
3849,John,2023-05-26,"great overnight start to our holiday . cleanliness , friendly and welcoming . great location for the airport ."
3850,Valerie,2023-05-26,Very good Very clean and staff were very good We required 3 beds and we're given a double and a sofa bed.. The sofa bed was so so hard.. Not alot of sleep was had on it..
3851,Paul,2023-05-26,"Comfort and convenient stay but abusive tarifs. The comfort and location of the property were very good. The price being charged is abusing it's monopoly position of being the only hotel on the airport. The matter is made worse by only offering a tarif including breakfast, when many of its clients will only stay there due to a very early check-in time and not able to consume the breakfast, (4am in our case)."
3852,Eric,2023-05-26,"Very comfortable hotel in an ideal location for the airport It is ideal for an overnight stay, either before your flight or on your return."
3853,Mervyn,2023-05-26,Just exactly what was needed - a very comfortable stay. Breakfast was fine. Hotel is very close to the terminal Very professional staff Room could have done with more milk cartons No biscuits
3854,Elizabeth,2023-05-26,"Nice hotel, convenient especially for very late arrivals. Expensive comfortable bed, pillows and duvet, nice room this time with Queen beds. Night receptionist was excellent. All looked very cared for. Hotel full yet no noise disturbance. PLEASE, more lighting to the hotel, especially via the ramp, also, make the hotel sign bolder from the airport approach, and indicate which way the steps are and which way the ramp is please. Breakfast spread good other than the ‚Äòtraditional English‚Äô No tomatoes, beans, black pudding(!) and on request for poached egg, was turned down and told nicely, ‚Äúonly scrambled egg‚Äù"
3855,William,2023-05-26,Superb Access to airport. Early breakfast available Bed was like lying on a plank
3856,Koji,2023-05-26,good location price
3857,Roland,2023-05-25,"Comfortable and convenient stopover hotel for the airport Comfortable room, excellent breakfast and very helpful staff. Ideal when arriving on a very late plane and not wanting an onward drive that same night. Finding our way from the arrivals terminal, although it was very close, to the hotel was unnecessarily difficult due to poor signposting of the route that avoided steps. We mentioned this to the hotel who said that the signage, unfortunately, was the responsibility of the airport."
3858,Dika,2023-05-25,"Great place to stay if you get in late. Right next to airport No fried eggs for breakfast, only scrambled (yuck)."
3859,Tim,2023-05-25,Adequate and good overnight stop off It‚Äôs not a top notch hotel but it‚Äôs perfect for an afternoon ver night stop before flying out. Food was ok nothing special but adequate. For what we wanted it was ok May be better selection of beers on tap!
3860,Heather,2023-05-24,Served the purpose of being close to airport for early flight Early start so wasn't fully awake!
3861,Jennifer,2023-05-24,"It met our needs and expectations for an overnight stay before catching an early flight. Staff were friendly and helpful. The airport is easy to access and very convenient. The room had everything we needed for a one night stay. We ate at the hotel in the evening and the system and the food was very good. A very good selection for breakfast. We had an early start so we were unable to have a cooked breakfast, which we would have had given the option."
3862,Danny,2023-05-24,"Airport hotel. Position, very easy to get to airport. Nice breakfast. Room good. For me the mattress was too hard, but I have a back problem so would probably be ok for most people."
3863,Helen,2023-05-24,"An expensive but convenient and comfortable option for the airport Very convenient for the airport (on site). Easy access with or without a car. The room was quiet, spacious clean and comfortable with a well equipped en suite. The restaurant provided a range of food and drink options. The staff were helpful and polite The price. I understand the premium location but the price is too high for the accommodation offered."
3864,Jason,2023-05-24,Very good Location is convenient.
3865,Peter,2023-05-23,Very good Great location. Excellent facilities. No cash taken. Card only.
3866,Frank,2023-05-23,"A one night stop Location just outside airport entrance. Choice of meals was reasonable and the curry of the day was good. Rooms starting to look tired. Bed settee was opened as a bed but there were only two of us staying. Carpet under the bed did not look as if it had seen a hoover in a long time. No access to fresh air, window locked so had to use air conditioning. The continental breakfast was very poor with little choice."
3867,Vivien,2023-05-23,Everything went very smoothly and no complaints. All good and the cleanliness was excellent. Nothing only maybe a fridge in the room.
3868,Malcolm,2023-05-23,"Generally good and a welcome rest after ou flight Position, Breakfast was a bit disorganised"
3869,Ian,2023-05-23,Good property was clean and convenient for an overnight stay food at the restaurant was good. prices seems to have gone up again making it expensive for a single overnight stay.
3870,Peter,2023-05-22,Very good Location
3871,Patricia,2023-05-22,"Superb 10 minutes walk to departures Lack of labelling at breakfast. Very confusing layout. No fruit choices apart from an orange, apple or banana."
3872,Sarah,2023-05-21,I would certainly recommend to take the stress out of an early morning flight the proximity to the airport for an early flight was unbeatable not being able to pay with cash
3873,Wendy,2023-05-21,Superb How close to airport ...clean bright and airey ...lovely lady on reception very helpful and friendly...food was really good too Nothing
3874,Elena,2023-05-20,"Lovely hotel, very convenient location for an early start The hotel is lovely, very friendly staff, great food, very convenient location for an early start. A bit expensive"

3887,Catherine,2023-05-12,Chosen for convenience and pro to airport. Its proximity to the airport.
3888,Debbie,2023-05-12,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
3889,Suzanne,2023-05-11,"Great position, great staff, great breakfast, poor quality room. the position of it, friendly staff, good breakfast. Shower tray didn‚Äôt drain properly, general quality of room, fixings etc poor considering it was a Hilton Hotel."
3890,Terence,2023-05-11,"Adequate for purpose. Room was comfortable if a little cramped but most importantly was clean and adequate for one night stay before flight. Restaurant was more like self-service works canteen, tables were not laid-up and any semblance of intimacy was non-existent. Prices were not 'over the top' but certaintly more than adequate for the meal presented. Lack of acceptance of payment by cash is a very annoying trend which I feel is totally unwarranted and most definitely not 'customer- friendly'."
3891,Mathew,2023-05-11,Very good Perfect location right next to the airport for catching a flight. Sound proofing amazing. Couldn't hear any planes Breakfast was only cold but I was up at 4am. Hot breakfast served later but paid the same
3892,Laura,2023-05-11,"Perfect for short stay Superb location, only some minutes to airport. There was no possibility to open the window"
3893,John,2023-05-11,Very good A little disappointed with the breakfast. No bread rolls and limited choice of hot food no fried eggs for example.
3894,Julie,2023-05-11,"Everything except the price was very good We‚Äôve stayed before at a more reasonable price. This time it was very expensive and so we probably won‚Äôt stay again, eventho the location is perfect for making a smooth journey for my husband who has early onset alzheimer and needs gentle transitions. The high price"
3895,Paul,2023-05-11,"the hotel did what was required, it was convenient to the airport fir an early flight we chose the hotel because of its proximity to the airport and for that reason only property is looking a little tired in places, food choice average drinks expensive"
3896,Mrs,2023-05-10,"Overnight one night stay prior to travel Great location, good standard of accommodation for an overnight stay prior to travel abroad Basic facilities with a basic dinner and breakfast menu. Hadn't realised it had hotel parking"
3897,Lewis,2023-05-10,"excellent location for the airport, very clean, well run, great staff. excellent stay. Perfect to early and late flights. we had a sofa bed in our room, but no sheets or pillows, which was a bit of a let down considering the excellence in other aspects of the stay."
3898,Phillippa,2023-05-10,great airport stopover staff friendly - perfect for an airport stopover also was really (pleasantly) surprised to know a continental breakfast is available from 4am extra amenities available (for a cost) which was much needed for an early flight nothing.

3901,Joy,2023-05-09,Good  Very basic low end dinner menu
3902,David,2023-05-08,An excellent chilled out one night stay in the Hilton at Bristol airport. The location was very close to airport departures. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable. You could not hear any of the planes taking off or landing which helped. The early morning breakfast was tasty with plenty of choice. And express checkout did what it said on the tin. Hotel to departures pulling suitcases along the walkway took less than 10 minutes. There was nothing to dislike about the hotel or its facilities.
3903,Jill,2023-05-07,A lovely stay Very good Nothing to dislike.
3904,Laura,2023-05-07,Ideal for an early flight from Bristol airport Location was excellent to catch an early flight in the morning. Excellent food at the Bistro in the hotel. The room was very small for 3 adults and the sofa bed wasn‚Äôt comfortable.

3906,Lise,2023-05-07,"Very good Clean and friendly, good work facilities. The food. The restaurant menu is very limited and the quality of the food not great. Breakfast not great either - not very fresh. It used to be better prior to the pandemic."

3910,Taylor,2023-05-03,"Friendly, clean and convinient for the airport if you have an early start Friendly staff. We were offered a 'take away' breakfast when I explained that I was leaving very early in the morning but we didn't take it as we were leaving before the restaurant opened. The location was very close to the airport. Expensive. I have stayed at hotels on site at Gatwick for a fraction of the price. It was a better hotel but not worth four times the price."
3911,Noeline,2023-05-03,"Room good,staff friendly, let down by evening meal. Breakfast good, evening meal very limited,and long,long, wait between ordering and receiving food. Food menu,and delay getting it."
3912,Marc,2023-05-01,"Location good but you'll find better priced locally Friendly staff, clean room The usurious drop off fee No breakfast to go! No excuse for hotel next to airport with early flights to have no breakfast to go, especially at cost of room"
3913,Jason,2023-05-01,average close to the airport cooked breakfast was cold and not enough tea facilities in room
3914,Melanie,2023-05-01,"Good start and end to holiday. Very easy to get to hotel from airport. We used shuttle bus from Bristol train station and all went very smoothly. Hotel well signposted, although you can see it if you look to left from front of airport. Check in straight forward, breakfast plenty of choices and hot, evening meal very nice and no over priced. Pillows could have been a little firmer. Even using two still quite flat. Bed itself comfortable."
3915,David,2023-05-01,Good Location and cleanliness The breakfast setup
3916,Rebecca,2023-05-01,Excellent facility The staff at reception were very pleasant. The room was super quiet despite the hotel's proximity to the airport.

3926,Rinske,2023-04-27,Superb everything
3927,Hazel,2023-04-26,Comfortable and convenient. Hotel on site at the airport so only 5 minutes walk. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The breakfast was extensive and delicious.

3938,Stephanie,2023-04-22,Location perfect Friendly staff despite checking in at midnight. Room great and shower fantastic. WiFi no problem. Breakfast a good buffet available from 4am! Lots of sockets. Bathroom sink situated quite far back so big leaning required to be over sink. Picky maybe. An extending shaver type mirror would be useful. Again picky though.
3939,Cathy,2023-04-21,Ideal for Bristol airport. Less than 5 minutes walk to the airport. it seemed a little busy & chaotic when we arrived but it is an airport!

Whilst the selection of bar food was limited in terms of offering - the food was good quality & reasonably priced. Breakfast - excellent selection and hot. Location is outstanding - a 2 minute walk to departures. There was nothing that I felt was unsatisfactory - only minor gripes were the air conditioning/heating was loud (had to switch off) and the double bed was close to the wall - so difficult to get out on this side."
3948,Gaetano,2023-04-17,As I expected Location early breakfast close to airport Food

3951,Bwh,2023-04-16,"Excellent airport hotel Our flight to Bristol was very delayed, and we didn't arrive until 230am. I called the hotel to warn them, and they couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. Comfortable, efficient room, and very decent breakfast."

The decor was super . 24 hour bar a great idea. Staff were FANTASTIC and could not have been more helpful. They bent over backwards to accommodate what we needed for a disabled person and made our airport stay far better than we imagined. We will definitely stay here again for our next flight . Only one thing we did not like was the continental breakfast, it was basically croissants , yoghurt and old fruit. It was really appreciated that it was open at 4 am but the choice of food and quality could have been a lot better ."
3956,Stuart,2023-04-15,as said previously very convenient for early flight out of Bristol airport. very convenient for an early flight out of Bristol airport. nothing.
3957,Ilja,2023-04-14,"Superb Breakfast was amazing as was the location, very convenient for us as we had to be up early (4.30am) to catch our 7.20am flight to Madeira. Continental breakfast was available from 4am which was perfect for us"
3958,Alan,2023-04-14,"Grateful for hotel, would stay again.2 Location very convenient, staff welcoming and helpful. Room a little cramped and shower a concern as I am disabled and floor slippery. A safety mat on shower floor, a change in bedroom arrangement."
3959,Giada,2023-04-14,"Very good Very convenient for early flights as it is right next to the airport. Good and clean facilities. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is excellent quality, but most items don't get restocked, so make sure you get there fairly early to have plenty of choice. Lovely hotel, but very overpriced for what it is. Unfortunately there is no real competition around, as it's the only hotel at walking distance from the airport. The price seems particularly high if you think that most guests (like us) only stay for a few hours, checking-in late evening and checking-out early morning. The sofa bed in the family room was very thin and uncomfortable. It would probably be ok for a child, but not great for an adult."
3960,Karen,2023-04-14,Superb Warm welcome despite being early hours after a delayed flight

3967,Claire,2023-04-11,"Very convenient and comfortable stay Staff on check in were very friendly, room was good size, clean and comfy. Good soundproofing, barely heard an outside noise all night and slept well. Didn‚Äôt experience other facilities as left very early in the morning but so convenient to stay right next to airport and get a good nights sleep before an early flight. Bed was quite squeeky when I rolled over, and just wish the price was a little lower."
3968,James,2023-04-11,"Stayed twice and enjoyed both times. Only down side was the pouring rain on both occasions Position of hotel on airport for easy access , room and breakfast very good, Staff friendly and attentive including early morning call. More than happy with our stay - can't think of anything we didn't like!"
3969,Richard,2023-04-11,"Great for early departures Location is great for departures, just across the road. Used the multi-story carpark which is next door. On checking in found out we could have used the hotel parking but didn't see this as an option when booking. Nothing, all good."
3970,Nicolas,2023-04-10,"Good Walking distance from airport terminal. Requested regular double room, but found room made up with sofa bed that we put away ourselves. Breakfast was not as good as on previous visits."

3986,Heidi,2023-04-04,"Had a great stay, it‚Äôs all very easy, looking forward to staying at the Hampton again. I love that it‚Äôs only a few minutes walk from the Arrivals at Bristol Airport. It‚Äôs so handy if you are coming in on a late flight or leaving on an early morning flight. Staff are friendly and the breakfast hours are great if you‚Äôre on an early flight. There‚Äôs a 24 hour reception. I found the room slightly cold and the bathroom floor very cold. It would be lovely if cloth slippers could be provided to help with this. It would help if there were more gluten free options at breakfast and things were clearly labelled for allergies, etc. Thanks."

4009,Craiglyn,2023-03-27,"Brilliant staff, convenient location and comfy room. We were travelling on a 6am flight with children so decided to book this hotel for the night before. Staff were excellent, hotel is very conveniently located with a short covered walk to the terminal and the multi-storey car park is right next door. Dinner was really nice and while I cannot comment on the official breakfast because we had to be in the airport before it started, a really nice touch they provided a small breakfast bag which was perfect to tie the kids over until we could get on the plane. We had a double room with a sofa bed which was perfect for the kids, really comfy stay. Would definitely recommend for a nice layover or for making an early morning flight more convenient."
4010,Kathleen,2023-03-27,Generally good apart from the breakfast set up The room was clean and bed was comfortable Staff very helpful and welcoming Breakfast a bit soulless as self service.

Take away breakfast was awful,, orange juice, banana, chocolate pastry and Alpen bar, the pastry was so dry we threw it away, then needed to buy breakfast at the airport. Next time I would take the breakfast from the early morning buffet. Room was lovely but little pieces of glass by the bathroom door and by the side of the bed. take away breakfast needs to improve. I wa unable to find out if there was a restaurant for evening meal before we arrived and was unaware they have their own parking on site."

4018,Barbara,2023-03-21,Love the convenience of the hotel near the airport especially on a very late arrival back to Bristol Had a great time even for the one night due to flight delayed upon arrival at the airport. Good to know there's a faster convenient way to get to the hotel. Breakfast closed up a little early for late check in guest. Whilst I understand that 10am was the last call. Perhaps the hotel can look into late check in guest perhaps offering a room service breakfast or a later time like 10.30am specifically for us
4019,Rachael,2023-03-20,great everything nothing really

4029,David,2023-03-16,Very good One night stay before our flight. Comfortable room - surprisingly quiet - and good breakfast. Reception staff friendly and efficient. On airport so no drama on the morning of our flight - just a short walk. The price is a bit high and it would be better to give a choice of available airport car parking with the booking - not everyone wants outdoor parking in the winter.
4030,William,2023-03-15,"Very good Good room, great breakfast, very convenient for early morning flight Breakfast available at 6 am"

4034,Elizabeth,2023-03-13,Very good Proximity to airport
4035,Joanne,2023-03-12,"Perfect hotel for when you flight is cancelled and your next flight is the next night! My flight from Bristol was cancelled due to snow so as I had stayed at The Hampton previously, I instantly knew to book quickly as there was going to be a lot of people needing rooms that night. The hotel is the perfect location as its just across the road from the airport. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, which I don‚Äôt remember being the case on my first visit. I had dinner in the hotel and I have to say that it was better than I expected and not a bad price. Breakfast was a good selection. I do think the rooms are expensive but I get that you are paying for the convenience of being so close to the airport, plus being the closest, they can charge those prices and still get the guests."
4036,Alexandra,2023-03-12,"Handy stay for the airport As close as you can be to the airport very handy. Food was reasonable, comfortable stay food room. Freindly staff. Continental breakfast was basic. Problem with the heating although heaters were in place. Price high, it is convenient but there are local b and bs offering better breakfast and cheaper price."

Waffles were fun to make. Quality of the food we ate was good. We didn't go for a cooked breakfast. Bathroom was excellent, loved the shower. Very comfortable bed and lovely soft pillows. Didn't hear any planes! Good size room which was very clean and ordered. We appreciated the lit pathway from the airport to the hotel after our late flight arrival."
4083,Yacht-surveyor,2023-02-26,OK its a good option if you have an early flight quite a long check in wait
4084,Roger,2023-02-25,"Excellent for early flights Breakfast served at 4AM! Excellent if you need to catch the 6AM Flight Restaurant didn't take orders at table. If you travel alone that's annoying, you'd have to leave your belongings unattended or drag them along every time you want a refill."

4089,Huw,2023-02-24,Excellent - will definitely come back and will probably choose Bristol airport again as a result. All excellent. Thought equal opportunities policy for staff was very refreshing. Breakfast was outstanding. Was encouraged to sign up for Hilton Honours via the messaging system on Booking.com but when I checked in I was advised that I wouldn‚Äôt get the points BECAUSE it was through Booking.com Woyid have appreciated a bit more transparency on that front.

Great connection by bus to Bristol city too. I enjoyed the coffee during breakfast a lot, breakfast in general was nice, breakfast area was also clean and staff was ready to help anyone out where needed. The staff at the hotel in general are very friendly and ready to answer any questions. The room was refurbished, was spacious and had all items one could need during a stay. The bed linnen had some area with a glue-like deposit on it which should have been picked up by the person preparing the room and it should have been replaced. I managed to get the deposit off myself though and it didn't bother me anymore."

4100,Janet,2023-02-20,Very good Easy walk to terminal early morning. Grab and go bag for breakfast before restaurant opened was a really good idea.
4101,Mary,2023-02-20,"Paying for location convenience right by hotel For a relatively expensive hotel it all felt a bit basic. Even loo roll was cheap - whole vibe no better than a Travelodge but three times the price. Queuing to order and pay for very basic evening meal menu seems at odds with the price per night. Staff all friendly and helpful though, and location excellent."
4102,Michaela,2023-02-19,"Good Very clean. Nice room. Good size. Nice bar/restaurant Lack of fridge, no water to drink in the room, and also nothinf complimentary. Very uncomfortable pillows...as too soft. Overall is good but with a price of 170 per night i was expect something little more."

We only stayed for 1 night but had an amazing evening and night at the hotel. Our flight was at 6am so we only had cold breakfast (bread with butter and cheese) as anything hot is served after 6am. Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely come back. Hot breakfast to be served earlier and fridge in the room."

4117,Diana,2023-02-14,"Very good Very helpful and friendly reception staff. Good downstairs area to eat and drink, I enjoyed seeing what was going on. The beds are a bit hard and on the little tea tray there was only enough milk for one mug of tea/coffee each."
4118,Gemma,2023-02-14,"Good Breakfast was excellent, the bed very comfy and staff helpful. The room was adequately clean, although the carpet could do with a bit more attention. The air con or heating was quite noisy. Generally it was as I expected, and I was satisfied with my stay"

4121,Rhiannon,2023-02-13,"Excellent location, friendly attentive staff, very clean and light setting Attentive staff offered extra help due to disability ( which is not obvious) Very helpful asking if I needed help getting to and from room completed fire escape form.

4123,Charlotte,2023-02-13,Convenient for an early morning flight Proximity to airport. Nothing fancy but comfortable. The breakfast was OK.
4124,Patricia,2023-02-13,"Overall it adequately served the purpose for which it was required. Would use again if necessary. The room itself was comfortable and the beds were a good size. There was a nice big vanity mirror with good lighting. Found breakfast a little disappointing, maybe because it was exactly the same as we had been experiencing for all our breakfasts on holiday. The bacon was tough and a little hard to cut. The sliding door to the bathroom in our room was very difficult to move and it took all of my strength to open it."
4125,Ashley,2023-02-13,Superb Comfort and convenience
4126,Geoffrey,2023-02-13,Convenient and comfortable. Location unbeatable if you have an early flight. Just a very short walk across to the terminal. Good to be able to get a Continental breakfast from very early too. Super comfy beds. Nothing really.
4127,Yvonne,2023-02-13,Reasonable Location good Sticky floor
4128,Nicolette,2023-02-13,"Very good The location for the airport was excellent, wake up and roll over to the airport. The added bonus about staying so close to the airport is that you can check-in your luggage the night before (with certain Airlines - Easy jet and TUI)"
4129,Angela,2023-02-13,perfect location for Bristol airport location clean breakfast was just ok
4130,Alan,2023-02-12,"Great location Great location, ideal for setting off on holiday or when returning Slightly chilling in the reception/eating area so not very comfortable when sat in that area."
4131,Christopher,2023-02-12,Other than my last comment a comfortable stay Breakfast was good and evening meal good value Not particularly easy access to airport or coach station when you are in your mid seventies and have heavy cases

4133,Steve,2023-02-11,"Enjoyable stay Early breakfast service very welcome. Staff very friendly and helpful Reception/Lounge area very cold. Due to lack of staff, bar/restaurant service could have been better"
4134,Cheryl,2023-02-10,it was superb the location and the whole feel nothing
4135,Jason,2023-02-10,"A very pleasant brief stay The location was perfect, the staff were really friendly and helpful at all interactions. The room was very clean and had just what I needed for a very brief stay. Nothing really everything as as expected or better than to be honest, due to my early flight I did not have breakfast so cannot comment on this aspect."
4136,Aggie,2023-02-10,ok for over night stay but very expensive location uncomfortable bedroom
4137,Jayne,2023-02-09,Good Location Breakfast
4138,Julia,2023-02-09,Hotel handy for my early flight. I needed better heating .It was expensive with overnight parking Good staff. Clean hotel. Peaceful. I was cold. Although I turned up the heating the bathroom wasn‚Äôt warm enough. The tv wasn‚Äôt a good one.
4139,Maria,2023-02-09,Family room Great location. Easy check in. Great bathroom. The children's bed was very hard and not much space in the room. Window didn't open. Bit stuffy.
4140,Deirdre,2023-02-08,Very good Very convenient for access to the airport
4141,Wayne,2023-02-08,"Decent airport hotel Hotel is OK in general. Decent rooms and food was OK too. Cant comment on the cooked breakfast as we only had a continentals due to the flight time, but it was good enough. Like every other Airport hotel, its not the cheapest but you pay for the convenience, and its modern."
4142,Heather,2023-02-08,"We stayed before collecting a hire car next day so had limited choice. Pleasant reception staff.Twin room better use of space than the doubles. Room heating worked. breakfast ok.Short walk from terminal to hotel. Bar staff refused to accept cash for dinner order ""company policy is card only"". Tough on those without a card, we won't eat there again for dinner. Catering style was canteen- order at bar, collect your own cutlery, food delivered to table, not a great experience."

The staff kindly arranged the airport to pick us and our baggage from the entrance."
4148,Graham,2023-02-06,functional airport hotel convenience to the airport room clean & relatively modern the window in the room was locked shut! isolation
4149,Leon,2023-02-06,in the end frustrating convenient for my husbands work place unfortunately we had a call from reception day before we were due to leave at 11.45 to remind us of 11.00 checkout so I had to phone my husband to make sure our dates were correct which they were no apology about their mistake ?
4150,Kate,2023-02-06,"Comfortable hotel, sooooo close to the terminal. Perfect The staff at check in and check out were extremely helpful and so friendly. The staff in the bar and food area too were very nice. Food was easy to order and quick to arrive. As for the room, very comfortable and quiet too which was just what I needed before an early flight. I wish I had know the parking cost before hand and then I would have parked for my whole time in the multi storey car park."
4151,Maria,2023-02-06,"Good convenient for early flight, even got some breakfast prices at the bar were too expensive"

4164,Heidi,2023-02-03,"very pleasant and would use again clean and friendly broken automatic door, lack of lighting in corridors before lights should be on, car parking too expensive if you are staying for one night?"

4170,Neil,2023-02-01,Always handy for early flights Room and bed comfortable Proximity to airport Dining area a bit too cafe like and it was cold
4171,Owen,2023-02-01,Perfect for an early flight If you're looking for an easy spot to make it easier to get to a very early flight then you can't do better than this. A one minute walk to the terminal. Hotel itself is exactly what you want from a Hampton.

4173,M,2023-01-31,"Superb The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable and the breakfast plentiful. The location within a short walk of the airport is superb. The free one hour stay for drop offs is very welcome, though needs better visibility. The lack of snacks (cakes, biscuits) to go with a cup of tea or coffee is disappointing."
4174,Alan,2023-01-31,"Good Convenience to airport. Increased warmth of public areas from previous stays. No rose wine. When I asked for a small red wine I was given a spirit sized measure! When I asked for complimentary water got told there was a tap in my room.. Asked for fried eggs at breakfast, was told ""we don't do fried eggs on Tuesdays"". People skills lacking all round. Also, rooms badly designed with one side of the bed only about one foot from the wall."
4175,Howard,2023-01-31,"Very good All very good, pleasant staff, good evening meal at reasonable price, clean and comfortable room, excellent choice for free breakfast. Would definitely stay there again."
4176,Mj,2023-01-30,"Very good The availability and position of the hotel. Friendly, welcomed by staff. Clean rooms.... Breakfast was more limited than in the past..... acceptable but a bit minimal. ."

4180,Alison,2023-01-28,"It was great to arrive in a such a welcoming place, both before departure - and on our return. This hotel is the only one at the airport, so it could not fail, but its proximity to it certainly made for a very relaxed departure and arrival. The rooms were not huge, but the beds being very comfortable made up for that and the toiletries provided: shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand wash and body lotion were good quality which made a welcome change as I did not need to unpack may own. The staff were, without exception, all lovely and helpful and pleasant. it would have been good if the bathroom door had been lightproof, so as not to disturb the other guest when needing to get up in the night! It was made with a see-through perspex panel. Also - shutting it made a loud sound and leaving it open to avoid this meant that one was reflected in the mirror opposite the door, whilst doing what you needed to - thus giving one's sharer a great view! We laughed about this, but you may not be aware! Secondly, the entrance area which is filled with tables for guests to drink and eat and meet was looking a bit tired with a few things scratched or peeling and in need of a bit of a refresh, d√©cor-wise to properly meet the star standard."

4213,Mike,2023-01-14,"Limited options in the area but this is a good option Just a few minutes walk from the terminal building. Clean and spacious lobby and reception area. Food wasn‚Äôt the best (quality or value) but what do you expect at an airport hotel, it was perfectly adequate for a night. Room was clean, reasonable size and bed good quality. Food could be a bit better, perhaps need to remember that there will be repeat visitors. I will use this airport regularly but might consider alternative eating arrangements."
4214,Graham,2023-01-14,Prepared to fly Ideal location for overnight stay before flying. Meals a bit average tasting. Needs better assistance to transport people with heavy cases to airport. Employ a helper with an electric vehicle

4216,Keith,2023-01-13,Okay but blooming expensive A 5 minute walk from the airport and breakfast from 4am so great for early flights. It was ¬£132 for a nice but ordinary room. It does feel they charge extra for the absence of alternative airport hotels.

4237,Jim,2023-01-05,Perfect located hotel for late night arrivals or early no departures Proximity to the airport given that I arrived on a late evening flight. Breakfast had some dodgy scrambled eggs rather than fried eggs (you can tell I am struggling to find something bad about the hotel ! )
4238,Debbie,2023-01-05,Great for night before a flight very good access to airport. friendly staff comfortable and clean
4239,Richard,2023-01-04,"All good except for the room temperature Location, food, size of room, shower Couldn't get the room warm but was too tired to do anything about it. Went to bed in clothes. The aircon unit was pumping out only cooled air, even when I set it to 25 degrees."
4240,Claire,2023-01-04,"Handy We've stayed before & it is excellent if you have an early or late flight, although it is a fair walk from the airport. Sounds petty, but the loo seat didn't fit the loo, and the toilet paper was really thin and cheap. Probably used twice the amount of paper, so I think it was a false economy on their part."

4246,Phillie,2023-01-02,Very good In the heart of the airport. Very comfortable rooms. Nice staff. Good breakfast with many options for lactose and gluten free. Toilet paper is beyond dreadful!
4247,Deborah,2023-01-02,Very good Breakfast Access with suitcases.
4248,Jason,2023-01-02,"Superb Everything else, but breakfast. Kind of leaves a bad memory in your mind as you head away from the property. A little disappointed with the choice of breads available and fruit at breakfast. Medium sliced table loaves and frozen summer berry fruit fruit don‚Äôt really cut it at this price."
4249,Christina,2023-01-02,Very good Very close to Airport & Tasty breakfast No bathroom with bathtub & expensive rates
4250,Alison,2023-01-01,great convenient hotel for airport but will not use again unless a good deal on the price arrives very close proximity to airport especially when able to check in our case the night before. staff very friendly and efficient and food OK. price has increased considerably since it opened. first paid about ¬£70 per night and have stayed 4 times. price increased every time but was ¬£144 this time with parking extra.
4251,L,2023-01-01,"Comfortsble and very convenient Clean, ideal proximity to the airport as our flight was in the early hours of the morning. I initially drove into the ‚Äúdrop off‚Äù area and was worried I‚Äôd have to pay ¬£5 at the barrier to get out. Better signage please."

4254,Tim,2022-12-31,the only on airport hotel so it‚Äôs worth the price excellent location and nice rooms
4255,Anita,2022-12-30,It‚Äôs very convenient for the airport but overpriced. Convenient for the airport. Comfortable and clean rooms. Food isn‚Äôt great. No hairdryer or usb ports which I would expect at the high price charged. Badly planned rooms - E.g. no thought given to plugging your hairdryer in and actually being anywhere near a mirror.
4256,Andrew,2022-12-30,very good except for bed receptionist ( young blonde lady) was particularly helpful to us. she deserves full marks and will go far in life bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. this was the only bad point about our whole one night stay .
4257,Jo,2022-12-29,"Very convenient and comfy, if you need to stay at the airport. Friendly, helpful staff. Lovely room and bright modern bathroom. Nice that conditioner was supplied. Friends came for a drink and were able to park for a couple of hours for free, which I really appreciated. Before arriving, it was tricky to discover whether there was a restaurant, or just breakfast; also the parking situation. I feel that these things could be promoted better, as both are positive additions to the hotel üòä"
4258,Elizabeth,2022-12-29,"An excellent option for an early flight from Bristol Airport We booked this hotel as we had a 7am flight and we did not have a car. It is a very short walk along a dedicated path across to the airport. Also, a continental breakfast was available from 4am which was excellent. The room was very spacious and well-equipped and the heating worked well. It is relatively expensive as it is the only hotel at the airport but it was worth it for the peace of mind."
4259,Richard,2022-12-29,fantastic english breakfast across the road from the airport. the english breakfast was fantastic direction/signage to the hotel can be much better
4260,Dennis,2022-12-28,Superb Pretty much everything. The room was very good with a comfortable bed. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent. The walk to and from the hotel in the rain
4261,David,2022-12-28,very convenient location but a few minor issues could be improved. Hotel is the only one on the actual airport site so location is good and you don‚Äôt need a courtesy bus. Food in the restaurant was standard stuff but good. Rooms are comfortable and quiet and breakfast albeit continental is on from 4:00 am as many staying are on early flights. Good welcome from reception. The hotel is much lower than the terminal building and even roll along bags require either a climb up several steep flights of steps or a lengthy walk up a series of ramps. There is a short covered section but got soaked walking to the terminal in heavy rain. can‚Äôt imagine why a covered way isn‚Äôt possible. Restaurant area is getting tired now and for our evening meal (self service)it was difficult to find a clean table.
4262,Linda,2022-12-28,Very good Very near airport for early flight
4263,Pamela,2022-12-27,"Bright and clean Beds comfortable, very clean, staff helpful and polite. We had to leave light on in toilet/shower room at night to enable my husband to use toilet safely. The only problem was that the majority of the door is glass and there was also a large mirror opposite, meaning not only was the light in the bathroom shining but also reflected by the large mirror in entrance area, looks very nice and bright, but meaning that the bedroom area was lit up all night, not conducive to a good nights sleep by any other person in party."
4264,John,2022-12-27,Enjoyed the stay. Not the parking charge Room was great. Parking charge was outrageous Overnight parking charge
4265,Nicola,2022-12-26,"Superb Clean, comfortable room. Good breakfast. The drinks were rather expensive in the restaurant."
4266,Margaret,2022-12-26,"Very good Convenient for early flight, good room and shower would use it again probably - depends on cost. One failing was no usb sockets, couldn‚Äôt believe this in a newish modern hotel used by a cross section of people flying. Goid that they did provide a plug adaptor but this needs addressing."

4297,Lynne,2022-12-11,"I chose this hotel because I needed to pick up a rental car the next morning and did not see the point of asking a famil convenient position. After a very late arrival, breakfast finished very early and I was unable to get any."

4317,Andrew,2022-11-28,"Bristol The hotel was spotlessly clean,well designed and equipped. The location was perfect for the airport and there was no aircraft noise either. The room was also not too hot ( as many such hotels can be) All in all a perfect place for an airport stop over. Having to pay for parking was not ideal. But it was discounted."
4318,Caroline,2022-11-27,great place to stay pre or post flight very convenient for airport. breakfast starts at 4am so was ideal for an early flight. safe easy parking for the car. plenty of space in room. information about car parking not completely accurate

Only second time in Bristol therefore my need to be at the airport early for my flight was the main reason I booked. Will definitively stay again! The price was a little higher than I normally pay, however the location made up for the extra cost"
4323,Anthony,2022-11-26,Excellent but for the mattress Convenience of location. We were able to drop our airline bags off the night before. The mattress in the room was too firm. I woke with backache. I would have appreciated a mattress topper. Perhaps you could tell me if they provide these. As a frequent traveller from Bristol this would me Imwould definitely stay again on numerous occasions during the year

4331,Charlotte,2022-11-21,"Almost perfect! Lovely room and hotel overall. Really comfortable, clean and well-equipped. Bathroom was lovely, shower was hot with good pressure. 4am breakfast was high quality and tasty. The smoke/fire alarm in the room (right above the bed) made an audible high-pitched whine all night, which did disrupt my sleep. Luckily I was only there from 11pm to 4am or I would have said something to reception."
4332,Victoria,2022-11-21,very convenient and comfortable. Staff on check in excellent. staff in morning a little uninterested really convenient for early flight. quiet room and comfy bed food choice very limited and was surprised at how quickly it arrived after ordering (about 3 minutes!!)

4335,Ryan,2022-11-18,"Great other than what ive mentioned already, really made my stay sour as it annoyed me quite a lot The stay itself was fine. The fact you have to pay ¬£5 to get out of the car in front of the Hotel or risk a ¬£100 fine is a total joke! The check in staff were agreeing with me on this point and stated that its not under their control, which is fine I accept that! However you as a company/leading brand of hotels should be sticking up for your customers for such things to be removed. Why do you feel its ok for your paying customers to ripped off on your front door? Bristol airport are making a fortune from something completely unfair and people are not given an alternative. money money money that's all its about. Unfair."
4336,Bleddyn,2022-11-18,Superb Great location. Excellent service. lovely and clean rooms Can't really fault the place. Perfect start to our holiday. No mad rush to the airport or stuck on the motorway.

4339,Thomas,2022-11-17,Very good Location Its a little expensive
4340,Gill,2022-11-17,Stay was fine.  bedroom was cold not told till the day we checked out we had to request if we wanted heating on.This should be in the information pack. like wise we were dropped off at the hotel and have twice paid a parking fee but this time discovered yo didn‚Äôt have to if you took the ticket to reception.
4341,Johanna,2022-11-17,Friendly efficient hotel. Very comfortable room and bed. Good bathroom and always very clean. Efficient service. Friendly staff. Housekeeping staff particularly good. Breakfast was a little disappointing. I found the food quite oily. The coffee machine is good but the powdered milk completely spoils the taste. Food choice for dinner was limited and until I ordered the curries I found the beef burger and the calamari dishes quite tasteless and the salads were very limited. The tables in the dining area need constant cleaning and the soft furnishings need to be steam cleaned - they are stained and dirty with food. It creates a bad impression altogether.
4342,Kenneth,2022-11-16,"other than above it was really good good efficient and wonderful staff (well the front desk when we got there) no refrigerator in the room (which was rather important, marketing told us there was one?"

4357,Holly,2022-11-07,We will be back :-) This was my first stay at the Hampton by Hilton at Bristol Airport. I slept much better than I have done at any other hotel or B&B on the way to the airport. It does cost a little more but in my opinion is was definitely worth the extra. The menu in the bar/restaurant area was quite basic. It met our needs but was not very exciting and had limited choices.
4358,Jason,2022-11-07,Good hotel but expensive. Staff very friendly Very expensive
4359,Emma,2022-11-06,"Superb Comfy bed, clean room, wonderful breakfast Evening bartender was very slow and confused"

4368,Denise,2022-11-04,Very good The check in lady was lovely and welcoming. The morning staff were very friendly and helpful There were no plug sockets in the room except standard UK which is not great for overseas travellers
4369,Luisa,2022-11-04,wales flight so room convenient for overnight stay. 30% too high comfortable room a bit pricey for Bristol airport
4370,Jennifer,2022-11-04,Good Your telephone message said the price of parking was ¬£8 but we were charged ¬£14.50. Would have liked to park the car for the 4 days but were not offered any options.

4372,Keith,2022-11-03,"excellent for stay when flying early morning room was good - compact we think - bathroom shower was a bit of a game, managed to get most of the room wet, screen not long enough? Breakfast was excellent for 4am as was the evening meal the night before as above, the room was compact which is ok for overnight but no more"
4373,Richard,2022-11-02,If you've got a 4am start it's worth it. Proximity to the airport for a very early flight. Able to fill a bag with pastries to take to the terminal Takeaway breakfast options were very limited. Price of a pint at the bar was extortionate.
4374,Simon,2022-11-02,"Convenient and a good hotel. Stayed over the night before my trip. Convenient hotel and can walk to the airport terminal. Clean, modern and spacious room. Friendly staff. Price a little expensive for a Monday night. Overall, satisfied. Booking parking with hotel could be simplified."

4378,Giada,2022-11-01,"Very good Very convenient for early flights. Room was clean & comfortable. Staff was very helpful. Quite expensive. It does make early flights a lot easier, but it's hard to justify the cost on top of flight tickets, so we don't book here very often."
4379,Lynn,2022-10-29,so easy to walk out of airport to the hotel. great location. price.
4380,Carol,2022-10-29,Well located and quiet hotel Fantastic location and wonderful breakfast. Quiet. Nothing

4385,Janet,2022-10-27,"Helpful staff, clean comfortable room, taxi available to airport dropoff. Food was available. Staff and room very good. Food available late and breakfast available from 4am. Situated within airport grounds. Short walk with plenty of steep steps, or ramps taking far longer, to walk to airport. No problem if fit and able and not pouring with rain! Arrow taxi rank at airport able to oblige with pickup from hotel and dropoff at airport for under 20 pounds. Worked, but you need to plan in advance especially if heavy rain as I had."
4386,Miranda,2022-10-27,would return clean and convenient very expensive food and drinks
4387,M,2022-10-26,"Hotel was great but access to Airport was not easy. The Hotel was very good. With two medium sized suitcases, we found the walk to and from the airport difficult and tiring. This was never explained before we booked the hotel and was not expected. We are reasonably fit and not disabled but neither are we Olympic athletes!!!"

4392,Alex,2022-10-23,Very pleasant Excellent location right next to the airport.
4393,Peter,2022-10-23,"Good  In a word, the food we ordered for dinner was absolutely hopeless. It was presented well but well, - tasteless and was not beef but something's pretending to be a hamburger. Terrible!"
4394,Veronica,2022-10-22,too short a stay to make further comments. but comfortable for what we needed perfectly located as we had a very early flight
4395,Matthew,2022-10-21,"Perfect pre-trip stay I've only ever seen this hotel from the outside and thought it would be the usual souless place you would expect to find at an airport. I couldn't have been more wrong. Great atmosphere, friendly and welcoming employees, decent size room and simply the best bed I've ever slept in (I want one!) Bar prices a little on the steep side."
4396,Hugh,2022-10-20,Convenient and efficient hotel for Beistol airport. Good breakfast too. Location and convenience
4397,Lynne,2022-10-19,Convient The room was comfortable. The food offering was poor in view of the price paid. Not even a proper restaurant. It is about transit passengers but the public areas are poor and not relaxing.

4399,Emma,2022-10-18,Expensive but comfortable stay in ideal location. location location location. you can‚Äôt ask for nearer if you have an early flight and amazingly convenient to do bag drop night before. price. it is expensive for what it is (chain hotel albeit reasonable standard) but fundamentally you are paying for location. Food in cafe (order at counter) is ok but generic.
4400,Jonathan,2022-10-18,"Very good very good staff rooms and location no fridges in rooms, when travelling with a newborn was inconvenient as couldn‚Äôt bring new borns milk. was offered shared fridge but obviously not happy leaving milk in there."
4401,Paul,2022-10-18,comfortable hotel which is so close to the airport that it is amazing for early morning flights. close to airport and very clean with friendly helpful staff. comfortable beds and quiet air con that was easily controlled helped get a good nights sleep before a very early flight. very early breakfast (available from 4am!!) was a bonus too. Evening dining facilities were limited in choice but slightly better than airport landslide facilities.
4402,Angela,2022-10-18,nearest to airport tick all the boxes near to airport
4403,Mike,2022-10-17,"Ok, location Breakfast. Ok Evening meal poor"

4409,Robert,2022-10-15,"Expensive, but OK The hotel was a 2 min walk from airport arrivals , which had lights all the way. The room was clean' The night staff were friendly' Don't think it was worth ¬£164 a night. No shower cap or toothpaste in the room, I think at ¬£164 a night, would have been nice."
4410,Nicholas,2022-10-15,very expensive but close to the terminal location is great for an early flight costs ridiculous amount of money and even short parking for drop off is expensive
4411,Ian,2022-10-14,convenient for Bristol airport convenient for Bristol airport. Clean and comfortable Breakfast could have been better. there were no croissants out and no plain yoghurt.

4418,Robert,2022-10-11,eased our journey with good location but expensive for what it is. comfy rooms very expensive for a one night stay. drink and food expensive for what it is food was ok but mediocre.
4419,Goody,2022-10-11,Superb Everything Having to pay for breakfast when we couldn't have a hot on as the flight was too early
4420,Kath,2022-10-11,"Comfortable stay. Shame about the food  The food was dreadful. Fast food, precooked and then microwaved, not what you expect from the Hilton brand. Continental breakfast was awful. No butter except for a tub of marks and spencer butter, pre-used with toast crumbs in it. No brown bread for toast and no milk. Nobody around to speak to at 4a.m. Receptionists busy with customers checking out"
4421,Ann,2022-10-11,"Superb Directly on the Airport , bathroom well equipped for our overnight stay, good selection of meals, reasonably priced and the included breakfast adequate . Pillows too soft, very uncomfortable, no matter how many I used they just sank to nothing, have stayed here before but they weren't like that then"
4422,M,2022-10-11,"Good Hotel but access to Airport is poor. The Hotel was excellent overall. With two average sized suitcases, the walk to the airport is hard work either up numerous steps or along several zigzag ramps. We were very lucky it was not raining/icy."
4423,Linda,2022-10-11,Very good Easy walking distance to airport.very conveniant
4424,Claire,2022-10-11,"Very good Close proximity to airport, was great for an early flight. Really friendly staff, especially in the restaurant. Liked that there was a breakfast pack to take away as flight was too early for breakfast in the hotel. Was very useful. Price was quite expensive, presumably because of proximity to airport. Not much choice of food at restaurant."
4425,Beatriz,2022-10-10,Very good Really comfortable bed and lovely room I received a wake up call at 5:30am by mistake as I did not request that. It didn't ruin my stay but I much rather not having received it.
4426,Roger,2022-10-09,oK. bit be warned very limited evening meal availability. Jose again? Yes but reluctantly. clean and tidy. comfortable bed and bathroom outrageous to charge for car parking for guest staying the night!

4430,Linda,2022-10-09,Very good Never had breakfast left to early could have if I wanted it .the evening meal was rubbish and needs to be looked at.
4431,Helen,2022-10-09,This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.
4432,Kevin,2022-10-08,Good overall and convenient let down by the canteen style restaurant good location for airport Restaurant food poor standard for a Hilton Hotel. Bar service queuing lane impersonal and spoilt the experience.
4433,Marion,2022-10-08,Great location Wonderful staff. Comfortable lounges to relax in. Great location for airport access. Room a little small esp given that the sofa had unnecessarily been set up as a bed. There were only 2 of is in Room 348.
4434,Hazel,2022-10-08,"Convenient hotel when you have a late or early flight. Very close to airport terminal Very quiet room Comfortable bed Reception told us breakfast was from 4am - 11am We arrived for breakfast at 10.10‚Ä¶.to be told by quite a grumpy employee breakfast finished at 10am. He reluctantly interrupted a business meeting in the breakfast area and then agreed we could have breakfast. Not great as we‚Äôd paid ¬£165 for the night. We didn‚Äôt have toast, fruit etc as felt a bit awkward interrupting the morning briefing. The grumpy employee might have offered to help get the extra things we needed for a full breakfast."
4435,Davina,2022-10-07,Overnight stay chosen for convenience Good food For the price and knowing people turn up at all times often travel weary there could be a bottle of water in the room
4436,Colin,2022-10-07,"See above The size and comfort of the bedrooms, the location and breakfast were very good. The evening dinner was terrible with little choice. The ""Special"" which was a curry was like slop a complete waste of money.For a hotel of that size and expensive (¬£155) for one night it should do a lot better"
4437,Sarah,2022-10-07,"Perfrct location, great staff and breakfast So close to the airport and couldn‚Äôt hear a single plane all night."

4444,Mrs,2022-10-05,"Convenient airport location Location and cleanliness absolutely faultless. The staff were very friendly and efficent and plenty of choice at breakfast even for a 4am breakfast. Very poor night of sleep given the price we paid, the bed was very uncomfortable which did not make a good start to our holiday. Think the beds have been changed since our last stay?"
4445,Sarah,2022-10-05,Essential and limited on time it was very close to the airport. The price for an emergency stay for one night.

4454,Bobbie,2022-10-04,"SURPRISINGLY BEST HAMPTON BY HILTON Normally Hampton's are basic and sometimes slightly depressing ""liverpool airport Speke Hampton Hotel comes to mind"" but this is not! Staff were brilliant from my 2:30 am check-in, my everything is included breakfast and to finally check-out. Great help, good breakfast & great service, to be honest best customer service ive received in a hotel for over 2 years and THATS alot of hotels. Well Done to your staff and you are definitely the bonus to a slightly unimpressive Bristol Airport."
4455,Heatley,2022-10-03,Very good Room clean comfortable excellent location to terminal. Food choice and quality not bad. Staff were friendly Little bit over priced you get caned for last minute booking .
4456,Sara,2022-10-03,"very happy will stay at this hotel again in the near future. Good breakfast, very close to the airport. Our room was good size, warm, and very clean. Better view maybe"

4459,Nicholas,2022-10-03,Perfectly fine. Convenient location Breakfast was too compicated when in a rush.
4460,Melanie,2022-10-03,"Really great stay, evening menu lacking choice. The convenience to the airport. The friendly staff, particularly at reception. Incredibly comfortable beds. Lovely temperature in bedroom. Clean and tidy rooms. The poor chouce of food for our evening meal, very basic and special menu stated peas but they were mushy peas....yuk!"
4461,Louise,2022-10-03,"Did the job though not a enjoyable and relaxing start to holiday, thought it was expensive. Convenient and geared up for flights, efficient and friendly check in. quiet, good beds, good sleep. Breakfast from 4 am ! Super close walk to terminal, though wouldn‚Äôt be ok if you had mobility problems as included 2 flights of steps. Good that taxis get a free pass out otherwise they won‚Äôt accept pick up . We were sorely disappointed by the poor quality, limited choice and poor value of evening meal . The ‚ÄòSpecial‚Äô was a dried up cheap pie, brown smash and a few mushy peas - only the gravy made it edible. I thought even the staff were embarrassed. The dining room area was grubby and tired (seats stained and bits of coleslaw / food o do had to watch where you sat).Badly arranged canteen style with little ambiance or coziness and was a continuation of reception and the thoroughfare to the airport. Breakfast was really good but chaotic, only one coffee machine switched on , run out of teabags, food stations and crockery/ cutlery not topped up - so took ages to find things you wanted . Room was good except for trim missing on bathroom door and grubby and shredded shower tray non slip section . Not what I expected from a good brand and premium price."
4462,David,2022-10-03,adequate position limited dinner menu
4463,Kathy-michele,2022-10-03,Very good Did everything it said on the tin

4466,The,2022-10-02,"Good Great buffet breakfast, friendly staff, and only a very short walk from airport entrance. We arrived near midnight with our little kid and they had forgotten to make up the sofa bed so we had to wait for them to come with bedding which was not great with a very tired and crying child."
4467,Ruth,2022-10-02,Very good Convenient. Polite helpful staff. Greek salad. Hummus was good

4470,James,2022-10-01,A comfortable and welcome break to my journey. The general ease of use/access is a major plus. The early breakfast is a great feature. The room was very comfortable and clean. There was a bit of noise from neighbouring rooms.
4471,Casey,2022-10-01,"Convenient and friendly We stayed here due to having a flight from the airport the next day - it was very practical. But the staff were friendly, the room was decent, and the breakfast had a good variety of options. Bed wasn't the comfiest ... but then I struggle with pillows etc that I find comfortable."

4478,Hans,2022-09-27,my very short stay fulfilled the purpose... excellent - nothing I didn¬¥t like nothing
4479,Alexander,2022-09-26,"THE LOCATION WAS BRILLIANT BUT AT A HIGH PRICE. WE CHOSE THE HOTEL PURELY FOR THE LOCATION AND THAT IT WAS A GOOD HOTEL CHAIN. THE STAFF WERE EXTREMELY FRIENDLY AND PROFESSIONAL. FOR ONE NIGHT'S STAY ¬£240 FOR ONE NIGHT WAS A LOT OF MONEY AND OVERALL DID NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THAT COST. THE ROOM FACILITIES WERE GOOD BUT HAD A BASIC LOOK/FEEL..........CONSIDERING THE COST OF THE ROOM. WE HAD A MEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MINE BACK AS IT HAD NOT BEEN MICROWAVED THOROUGHLY. THE CENTRE WAS COLD AND THE REST TEPID. THE STAFF WERE QUICK TO SORT THIS OUT AND THE REPLACEMENT MEAL WAS PIPING HOT. HOWEVER, THE MEAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN PIPING HOT TO BEGIN WITH! ONCE AGAIN, FOOD AND DRINK HIGHLY PRICED BUT NOT AT A STANDARD THAT GOES WITH ¬£240 PER NIGHT."

4486,Finola,2022-09-24,"Convenient for airport (250 yard walk), clean and comfortable, but all of the above. Very close to airport and room clean and comfortable. Check in staff cheerful and friendly. Menu could be improved, along with the service at the bar (One person who blamed staff shortages - not my problem) We booked a room with breakfast, but had a very early departure so we were given a breakfast bag - a banana, a chocolate cereal bar and something else which I threw away - very poor, not even a hot drink. All in all, OK for convenience but very expensive (¬£157) for what we actually got."
4487,Ruth,2022-09-24,Excellant and a perfect start to out UK trip Hot Breakfast was very good and with a wide variety of items We are very pleased with Bristol and the close location of the Hotel. The room more than met our expectations I found it difficult to find the right sized plated and surprised there was no Hot plates for the Hot breakfast.

4496,Sally,2022-09-20,Good It's a comfortable and safe hotel for solo travellers. The price! The room was much more expensive than in February. The croissants at breakfast could have been fresher.
4497,Jackie,2022-09-20,Lovely stay although quite expensive for time we were there. We were very early leaving and able to take a bagged breakfast! Excellent! Somewhere for children to sit and play quietly . There lots of games and drawing available but children had to sit at tables next to adult strangers.

Ideal to walk to the airport. 3 people in room meant the 3rd person was on a sofa bed so limited space to move and the sofa bed was not very comfortable.

Continental Breakfast available for early starters. We had an issue with checking in. I had booked two rooms and they had difficulty with finding one of the rooms details. However this was sorted quite quickly. Little on the expensive side for the time we were there.
4519,Madeleine,2022-09-15,"Good, but too expensive! Room was excellent - everything great. Location great - short walk to Terminal - ideal place to stay for an early morning flight.

We were surprised also how quiet the hotel was considering its proximity to the airport. The ease of booking in to the airport for our flight Just a small complaint about the breakfast. The sausages were overcooked and the skins were very tough to cut through. Also the scrambled eggs were dry. Otherwise everything else was okay.
4528,Alison,2022-09-13,"It was easy to book, expensive for one night but comfortable stay close to the airport very expensive. not many staff on when checking in so took a while (30mins wait) we didn‚Äôt eat as the reviews were not very good."
4529,Linda,2022-09-13,"It was comfortable but t would have liked a warm, comfortable and friendly bar or coffee area It was very close to the airport. It was too expensive and the decor and facilities did not warrant the high prices. I would have expected a much higher standard for that price range."
4530,Karen,2022-09-12,"Great location, nice clean room. Wish we had known about the food available Room. Tea and coffee in room. Shower. We were advised that there was no restaurant .

I was not able to have breakfast at the hotel as my flight was too early for the breakfast service but a take away breakfast bag was supplied instead. My hotel room was very quiet and I did not have any disturbance from the airport. I cannot think of anything that could be better."
4536,Beverley,2022-09-12,Superb LOVELY STAFF Bed was super comfy and hotel really clean Not enough choice for vegetarian food. I arrived late and all that was available was cheese sandwich. The soya milk seemed to be a problem for the staff but they got round it. At the morning buffet the potato cakes were hard and dried out. The vegetarian sausages were of very poor quality and tasted horrible. I think you need to increase awareness of available vegan and vegetarian options for cooked breakfast.
4537,Jane,2022-09-11,Very good  We didnt find the beds that comfortable. The evening menu is very limited

4585,Trevor,2022-08-26,"Ideal overnight for dropping of hold luggage the evening before and an early flight. Expensive howe Location, facilities and staff Booking.com advertised a property credit of ¬£20 included in the ¬£185 rate and as we intended to dine, thought this was worth the extra. The hotel staff were unaware of this offer/arrangement which was awkward and embarrassing, although they were charming enough to honour it. Please sort this out between the hotel and Booking.com as it should not be advertised unless agreed and known by staff."

4593,Sotiria,2022-08-23,"Good Excellent location, 5 min on foot from the airport. Ideal for an overnight stay. The room was a good size and the bathroom was spacious. I explicitly requested a packed breakfast as we had an early flight. Even though I was promised that would be the case, there was no packed breakfast available at 06:00 and we had to quickly grub a couple of items from the breakfast buffet on our way to the airport."
4594,Rhianydd,2022-08-22,From the airport to bed in under 10 minutes! The location is perfect for the airport Breakfast is good with plenty of choice and extended times.

4603,Margaret,2022-08-18,"Comfortable, nice hotel, very convenient. Location was excellent for an early flight At 1.30am in the morning the emergency alarm was going. This was apparently a ""false"" alarm. Everyone had started to evacuate when we were told this. There was no apology or explanation. This meant disrupted sleep particularly for families in nearby rooms."

4608,Rebecca,2022-08-14,"Good for ease of access to the airport for an early morning flight. Location, ease of access to the airport, clean and modern hotel The queen sofa beds aren‚Äôt comfortable. The food in the restaurant at dinner time was poor. The digital key on the app didn‚Äôt initially work and I was told to go to the checkin despite checking in in advance which defies the point of the early checkin."
4609,John,2022-08-14,"ok, but if it wasn‚Äôt for the location the hotel wouldn‚Äôt have an awful lot going for it. but if you want the airport the location No room service"

Take away breakfast available if leaving early. Clean, spacious family room with big sofa bed and a queen bed. Staying one night to drop son off at airport early in the morning. Had to pay 15 pounds car park fee for the night. Thought it could have been complimentary as staying in hotel."

4615,Lauren,2022-08-10,"Exceeded expectations I wasn't expecting much from this hotel when booking. Booked for convenience as it was closest to the airport, however it exceeded my expectations. Loved the rooms, the decor and ambiance. Staff were friendly and helpful. All facilities were up to a good standard. Good choice especially for breakfast! We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend. The toilets in reception were not clean and there were crumbs and dirt in reception waiting area that let the rest of it down."
4616,Erica,2022-08-09,Superb convenient to airport fir late arrival and fir pick up of hire vehicle. my room was at the end of a corridor so very quiet.
4617,Leony,2022-08-09,Convenient but a little expensive especially when having y to o pay h fi or parking on top  Having to pay to park at the hotel! I know we had an early flight so left at 3am but I think they could offer more than they do for breakfast at that time for the price or give the option of not paying for breakfast.
4618,George,2022-08-09,"Very good Very close both to the airport terminal and to the multi storey car park 24 hour check in, which was quick, efficient and friendly"

4628,Alison,2022-08-06,"Superb Great staff. So handy for the airport. Great aircon (I was there in the heatwave). It was a bit pricey, but airport hotels often are."
4629,Barry,2022-08-06,"Disappointing compared to previous stays We have stayed here quite a few times when having an early flight or late arrival. In terms of proximity to the airport and pure convenience, it just can't be beaten. Compared to previous stays, this was disappointing. The hotel remains unchanged in terms of cleanliness, professional staff and convenience etc., but the price we paid was considerably higher than before - I would say double the price, if not more. My past reviews were, of course based on a lower price, and therefore better value. The food served also seemed to be of lower quality - same menu, similar price, but just not as good. We have decided, despite the obvious convenience, not to repeat our stay at current pricing levels."
4630,Kate,2022-08-05,"Very good Short walk from the airport, lovely staff, v comfy bed and good breakfast. There's also a huge space for hanging out before you need to go to the airport, with departure boards. Much more comfortable than the airport itself."
4631,Emmanuel,2022-08-05,"All perfect...but the ""restaurant""!! Super fast check in, I was done in 2mn. The room was perfect, spacious, clean, comfortable bed, everything there. Short walk to the terminal. Staff very professional. The restaurant is not really a restaurant. I order indian food, it arrived within 5mn, tasted rather like a cheap ready meal (I really believe it was a ready meal, it was definitely NOT proper food cooked from scratch), awful. And you can only pay by card, they do not accept cash. I wish I got a Subway from the terminal instead."

We weren‚Äôt offered a choice for it not to be included."
4643,Hannah,2022-07-31,Good and convenient Helpful packed breakfast for an early flight It‚Äôs quite expensive but not surprisingly so given how convenient it is for early flights
4644,Karen,2022-07-31,Superb Standards of cleanliness are top notch. Food quality of evening meal was not tasty(fish and chips) chips were lukewarm.
4645,Charles,2022-07-30,"As an airport hotel it was a good choice being close to the terminal and met our requirements. We picked this airport hotel due to a leg injury I sustained whilst on holiday. I booked Special Assistance with the airline and the hotel staff were very helpful in arranging for the transfer bus to the terminal. Room was well furnished. Bathroom with large walk-in shower was a plus. The twin-room could have been a little larger as it was very difficult to use the chair at the work desk - too tight to the bed. Basic English breakfast, adequate but nothing exceptional."

4693,Beverley,2022-07-08,Superb  Lovely but expensive
4694,Tim,2022-07-08,Very good As requested we got a quiet room which made for an unusually good night's sleep at an airport hotel.
4695,Stephen,2022-07-07,"Excellent location, extremely comfortable and amazing staff. The staff were all very helpful but some were new and did not know the system. The room was perfect for my mother and I. It did not mention that there was a kettle in the room which was an added bonus. My Aunt and Uncle drove us to the hotel which was quite a distance for them. It was so nice that we were able to offer them tea in the restaurant and not have to pay a parking fee as the car parking ticket was validated by the reception staff. I was also able to push the wheeelchair for my Mother from the room to the airport check in without too much effort."
4696,Gideon,2022-07-06,"very nice convenient stay Very good location next to the airport, perfect for my morning flight. Very nice size room with comfortable bed and excellent breakfast."
4697,Blackstar,2022-07-06,"Comfortable and welcoming. Late, very late check in thanks to a very delayed flight was no bother. Check in staff were very welcoming indeed. Bed very comfy, quiet, welcome night sleep. Breakfast staff were very helpful and happy. Made to feel really welcome. The prices have been creeping up somewhat. Looking at future prices, I think we may need to look elsewhere which is a shame because this has always been a good value hotel."
4698,Clare,2022-07-06,"Lovely, clean hotel Really comfortable and clean. Breakfast started at 4am and it was brilliant..lots of choice. Was given choice of floor too and staff were lovely. It was quite expensive for one night stay but I was willing to pay this for the convenience if being so close to airport in morning."
4699,Rebecca,2022-07-06,"Nice hotel, dinner in restaurant poor Lovely fresh rooms, nice and big, easy to control temperature, black out curtains excellent. Breakfast setup great for early flights Quick walk to airport Food was terrible. Ordered a jacket potato with beans for my daughter, the beans were stone cold with some scrambled egg in them??? Couldn't help but think they were left over from breakfast. Gross. I ordered a burger and chips and neither were even warm! We sent both meals back (after having to flag restaurant staff down they were no where to been seen during the meal) but both came back barely warm again. Couldn't be bothered with the faff of having to find someone again as we were starving from travelling. No one came to check or say sorry it was really poor for the price of the food and the price of the rooms!"
4700,Nicholas,2022-07-06,"Very good Get staff, location, breakfast, cleanliness etc. We wanted family room (2 adult 2 kids) but all that was available was double with sofa bed pullout. The pullout sofa in the room had a hard metal mechanism poking out which our young daughter hurt herself on while getting out of the bed."
4701,Cherry,2022-07-05,Superb Such a convenient location to the airport- great. Check in was speedy and the receptionist was helpful and informative. Beds were comfortable and we slept well Surprised that breakfast ended so abruptly and also so soon after fresh hot food had been put out
4702,O\'connell,2022-07-05,"Was good value for what we needed. Ie . 1 night stay before early flight. Was , we thought value for Did not have breakfast, left for early flight, took pre packed breakfast bag. Was acceptable , could have been a bit more substantial. But acceptable.. Nothing."
4703,Stephen,2022-07-05,Very good How close it is to the airport. The prices at the bar.
4704,Beryl,2022-07-05,just the best place to stay when you have a late arrival or early departure. super convenient and confortable super nice personnel the food isn‚Äôt really great but that‚Äôs ok
4705,Wayne,2022-07-04,"Enjoyable nights stay that took the stress out of travelling and flying on the same day Location takes the stress out of travelling to the airport same day to fly. Friendly staff, clean room, great shower and comfortable bed. Food and drink was reasonably priced given the location Was not made aware at check in that a breakfast bag was available for early departures. This would have been good to know as breakfast proper is not available until 4am."
4706,Christian,2022-07-04,OK  Ok
4707,Maria,2022-07-03,"It was good. Efficient. Comfortable. Comfortable bed. Nice shower. Clean room. Breakfast available since very early morning. Efficient service at reception and restaurant. Convenient location. Room size just about right - I would have liked it a bit bigger given the room price. Hair dryer missing. Restaurant menu is ok but some little improvements could help. Service at the restaurant very minimal - no table cloth, cheap silvery, table not quite clean."
4708,Katrina,2022-07-03,"Good option if you have an early flight Excellent location. Comfortable room. Friendly staff. Nothing in the short time we were there, we arrived late and left very early & only spent time in our room."
4709,Judy,2022-07-03,"A good and convenient airport hotel The breakfast was really good. I was wondering expecting a continental type meal but instead there was a well cooked full English breakfast available as well as a wide choice of cereal, toast and fruit"
4710,Pauline,2022-07-02,Very convenient. Close proximity to the airport terminal. Staff were helpful. Clean rooms. Lots of places to sit and relax.
4711,Robyn,2022-07-02,Superb excellent rooms; beds extremely comfortable what's not to like?
4712,Caris,2022-07-02,"Does the job for a stay before an early flight. Continental breakfast from 4am, good if you have an early flight. 3 minute walk to the terminal."
4713,Anne,2022-06-30,great location for sirport but expensive nice clean comfortable rooms restaurant/ bar area - like a canteen
4714,Ian,2022-06-30,Reasonable Staff good Breakfast did not reflect the cost
4715,Eftychia,2022-06-30,Very good  breakfast bag could have included more/better quality items
4716,Melanie,2022-06-30,"Superb clean, spacious, comfortable too many steps down to the hotel"
4717,Andrew,2022-06-30,Good Gym Really poor evening meal cold.and poor; wouldn't recommend this hotel
4718,Mairi,2022-06-29,would definitely stay here again and recommend to other people so close to the airport it‚Äôs perfect breakfast wasn‚Äôt the best but adequate
4719,Julian,2022-06-29,Handy for airport but not good value for‚Äôoney  Food very poor and overpriced
4720,Roberta,2022-06-29,Very good It would be good if they could have a flight info screen on each floor so you don't go and hand your key in then on way out see your flight is delayed for 2hours Nothing
4721,Val,2022-06-29,"Very good Perfect location, staff friendly No additional pillows in room"
4722,Margaret,2022-06-28,"Necessary due to late arrival of flight. Room, facilities, breakfast all as it should be. All just as it should be but expensive for a few hours sleep. Breakfast good. Price"
4723,Elizabeth-ann,2022-06-27,great place to stay prior to an early morning flight close to the airport and provided an early breakfast a little overpriced
4724,Gerard,2022-06-27,very close to the airport stay ideal for airport early/late flights; nice downstairs lounge/restaurant
4725,Janet,2022-06-26,"All the staff were cheerful and extremely helpfully I had ordered special assistance with Ryanair and the hotel told me that there was no problem with this. However at 4am they were not able to contact Ryanair - no one was answering the phone.After more than half an hour of trying, one of the receptionists said that she would go up to the airport with me and carry my luggage. I was very grateful and thought that this was above and beyond the call of duty. I would have liked waitress service in the restaurant. As I have a back problem I found standing in a queue waiting to order very difficult."
4726,Wendy,2022-06-26,"great for an early flight but expensive Clean, friendly staff, location great for airport it was expensive"
4727,Abid,2022-06-26,We can thoroughly recommend this hotel and will use again the location was excellent and the decor and size of room exceptional the quality and price of meals being offered
4728,Teresa,2022-06-26,"Bristol airport hotel Close to terminal, great rooms, modern, bright, nice staff, comfortable beds, nice toiletries....fresh clean linen. Good to have breakfast and a restaurant available. Buffer breakfast could be improved, breads with cold meats would be better, one coffee machine and hot water not working."
4729,Lynne,2022-06-25,"Great location and nicely furnished. Great to have the hotel just a short walk from the airport, when we didn't land until 1:30 in the morning!"
4730,Shirley,2022-06-24,Good. Made our flight out to Majorca so much easier after a good nights sleep and breakfast readily available to help ourselves. Room clean and comfortable..
4731,Gareth,2022-06-24,great location but price is going up significantly every year. service is really poor but the location is unbeatable for location service
4732,Irene,2022-06-24,Superb Comfortable hotel Ideal location for the airport.
4733,Iain,2022-06-24,"Great for travelers - but expensive excellent facilities, good breakfast, great location Aircon not working in room"
4734,Jackie,2022-06-23,ideal pre holiday flights ideal airport hotel. functional and clean with friendly staff. nothing
4735,Rafael,2022-06-22,"Good Check-in was quick and easy, close to the airport, room was comfortable, breakfast was great, good ambiance. AC didn't work and after a call it still wasn't fixed"

4740,Colin,2022-06-20,Good Location Thought the restaurant menu was very poor
4741,Brenda,2022-06-20,As above Hampton just short walk to airport No breakfast had to beat airport by 4am No complaints all as expected
4742,Natalia,2022-06-20,Superb was very short walking distance to the airport. Was quiet so could have a good night rest before the early morning flight.
4743,Kate,2022-06-20,"We enjoyed our stay and being able to check our luggage in with Jet2 the night before made things so much less stressful proximity to the airport. Takeaway breakfast was very poor. Two cartons of juice, an apple and a packet of biscuits!"
4744,Daniel,2022-06-19,Very good  Room service
4745,Elizabeth,2022-06-19,"Very good welcoming poor external signage from the Airport. Poor lighting to the hotel once one had left the immediate Airport area, as a woman I would have been very wary if I had been on my own. Some breakfast foods not available."
4746,Colin,2022-06-18,Superb Conveniently located on the airport. Room comfortable.
4747,Fee,2022-06-17,"Stay was very comfortable. The location was excellent and so surprised we couldn‚Äôt hear any noise from airplanes. Excellent breakfast. Your front of house male on the checking in desk was very pleasant and helpful. We did go to get some drinks and a female serving was a little bit brusk and not extremely helpful, plus I couldn‚Äôt get a coffee as she said the machine was broken. She seemed a little bit impatient."
4748,Isabelle,2022-06-16,Very good Walking distance to airport Breakfast was not cooked properly
4749,Laraine,2022-06-15,great for airport travel. at the airport so great for tired travelers. breakfast was very basic.
4750,Collette,2022-06-14,comfortable and great location easy access to airport for early morning flight restaurant service could be better
4751,Linda,2022-06-14,stay overnight for early flight great location for airport
4752,Angie,2022-06-14,"Great for an early morning flight Right next door to the airport, had an early morning flight so missed breakfast but they did a take away breakfast of a croissant, juice and an orange. Friendly staff, restaurant food is quick and easy ie pizza, burgers, pasta dishes"
4753,Kelly,2022-06-14,"Ideal location Great location Only a takeaway breakfast bag as I had an early flight, but the booking is bed and breakfast"
4754,Linda,2022-06-14,"we would definitely stay there again. Ideal location convenient location, clean, bedrooms quiet. queues for drinks and food. insufficient staff"
4755,Sue,2022-06-13,Very good Didn‚Äôt have breakfast Thought it was expensive
4756,Sharon,2022-06-13,"Superb Location, comfortable and clean. Good breakfast Everything was ok"
4757,Goddard,2022-06-13,Will use again The location in relation to the departures at the airport
4758,Leigh-anne,2022-06-13,overpriced but convenient stop over for early morning flights. proximity to airport is main reason to use this hotel as the room price has become very expensive. Staff are pleasant. Nothing much not to like except perhaps there was a lack of anything easy to grab like a banana at 4am for an early morning flight and no bags obvious to take a pastry in. I didn't have time to search for a staff member to ask. I would only use this hotel when flight departure is 8 am or earlier as it has become quite expensive. There are many other options within a 10 minute drive some offering airport transfers.
4759,Alyson,2022-06-12,"Very convenient for flights and a good quality room The room was very well appointed, attractive and spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable and the room was well sound-proofed. staff at reception and in the bar/restaurant were all very friendly and helpful. The restaurant meal wasn‚Äôt great quality and the advertised ‚Äôgrab and go‚Äô breakfast for early starters turned out to mean ‚Äòmake your own breakfast and put it in one of these bags - except that we‚Äôve run out of bags.‚Äô We ended up just grabbing a croissant, which turned out to be stale."
4760,Edwina,2022-06-12,It‚Äôs was ok and convenient  Juice provided that had to be thrown away at check in
4761,Tim,2022-06-12,Very good stay after a flight Location is just outside arrivals/departures.Food available at all times and the breakfast is particularly good.Very clean and comfortable place to stay Nothing to dislike
4762,Christopher,2022-06-12,"very pleasant stay before flying rooms were spacious, very clean. the rooms a were very quite . walking distance to the airport.ordered evening food which was very good . that the high price did not include a takeaway breakfast which was in with the prices. we had a early start. that we had to pay parking at this hotel which was next door to the hotel."
4763,Verenna,2022-06-11,"Ok, convenient but expensive clean, nice shower, lovely staff. Not a great mattress and duvet too small for a queen size bed! why do hotels use too small duvets? curtains could do with a hoover! very dusty. Food was adequate but not great."
4764,Keith,2022-06-11,Excellent location and a very well maintained hotel with polite and friendly staff Great location for airport. There were several items on the menu not available.
4765,Joy,2022-06-10,ok location reception staff so very slow at check in - late at night and just took ages with the computer and paperwork.
4766,Lynda,2022-06-09,Convenient location but what happened to my pajamas?? Convenient I left my pajamas in the room and only noticed when I got to the holiday destination but thought no worries picking up thecar in a week's time I will call in to Reception which I did. Told them I had been in Room 10 a week ago but staff said no pajamas. Either the cleaner took them or simply threw them away. I emailed the General Manager and have heard nothing. Considering we paid ¬£186 for the room and we had to leave at 2am in the morning and we were told there would be breakfast bags to Takeaway which there wasn't I think it is not good value. Surely a hotel of this size must have some sort of Lost Property system in place.
4767,Mrs,2022-06-08,"Very good  The take away breakfast was poor in comparison if had a full breakfast for the same price. Banana, breakfast bar, OJ and pain au chocolate did not warrant a B&B price"
4768,Tracy,2022-06-08,Overnight stay The staff were brilliant in the restaurant and bar area. The menu and food were very basic. The communal areas were quite dirty
4769,Patricia,2022-06-08,Just want we needed and so clean and very helpful staff on reception  Disappointing menu but everything else very good. Would stay again
4770,Kevin,2022-06-08,Good Located Fire door outside room banged due to door dampers not working
4771,Terry,2022-06-07,Great location within the airport - value for money. Very friendly and efficient booking in on the day. Room was very comfortable and spotless. Breakfast was excellent and plentiful. üëç -
4772,Alex,2022-06-07,Good Amazing provision of takeaway breakfast for early morning flyers. Could be more sound proofed.
4773,Zak,2022-06-07,"absolutely perfect for a nights rest before and after any holiday trip very close to the airport, so incredibly convenient! the food is pricey whilst being nothing more special than wetherspoons food. We weren‚Äôt personally fans of the pillows"
4774,Neil,2022-06-07,I would use it again Location excellent for an early morning flight Not easy to get into hotel from multi storey story carpark at night
4775,Alec,2022-06-07,"A good place to get your head down after a long uncomfortable night flight Convenient location after a night flight, so we were both tired and just wanted a comfy bed for a few hours. It was all fine"
4776,Judith,2022-06-07,"Good close to airport, very friendly stuff, clean The restaurant could be a touch better, but I have to say we stayed just after travels started to pick up"
4777,Chris,2022-06-06,"Only stayed one night and very pleasant. Breakfast was lovely and plentiful,good choices. Airport nice and close. room wasreally nice. passage from the airport was in places steepish, which some people should be aware of."
4778,Cindy,2022-06-06,"I liked the facilities, food and comfortable room, but as I normally travel alone it was expensive for single occupancy very convenient for the airport. food very good. expensive if you were travelling alone. no single rooms."
4779,Katrina,2022-06-06,"very convenient for airport if pricey location, check in, comfy bed price was rather high at over ¬£200"
4780,Paul,2022-06-05,Very good Easy check in. Comfortable room
4781,Sue,2022-06-05,"Very good Breakfast selection was Ok, the hot dishes could have been hotter, Our room was was of the ground floor, I did not like we had people walk past our window . I found this to be very disconcerting."
4782,Scott,2022-06-05,Very good Location and service v good. We didn't have time for breakfast as our flight was so early.
4783,Gazk,2022-06-05,"Comfortable hotel very close to airport. Arrived very late after a delayed flight - 2.45am But at least we got some sleep before heading home the next day. Room was comfortable, but we didn't have breakfast - needed to get as much sleep as possible. A later check out would have been appreciated."
4784,Joanne,2022-06-05,"Perfect location for airport We had an early flight so it was perfect location being a 5 minute walk from the airport. Nice toiletries. Tea and coffee is room which is always a plus! The room was spacious and clean. Unfortunately we did not have time for breakfast, which was included as we had to check in. I would imagine lots of people miss out on breakfast due to early flights but I don‚Äôt remember seeing any options excluding breakfast (i could be wrong). Staff not overly friendly, just ok."
4785,Grocott,2022-06-04,"Good Room.was clean., good shower and comfortable bed Not much of a choice at breakfast at 5am. Overpriced , but convenient for the airport"
4786,Eve,2022-06-04,"quiet and very comfortable room was just what I needed after a flight delay clean and quiet room none, it was as expected"
4787,Mary,2022-06-04,ok but have had better there easy access to airport too many crowds and not enough staff to handle
4788,Tracey,2022-06-04,Superb short walk to the airport.
4789,Beverley,2022-06-04,"It does what it says on the tin! Room was good, shower excellent. Therr weren‚Äôt enough staff to cope with the influx of very close to the airport"
4790,Ian,2022-06-03,excellent faculties but very limited on catering. much queuing and poor coffee quality proximity cleanliness friendliness catering was mediocre
4791,Penelope,2022-06-03,"Better than I remembered Hotel was very busy and airport in chaos, but the staff had it all in hand and were managing smoothly with a smile on their faces. Very generous check out policy when our flight was delayed Food is a bit Meh, though breakfast from 4am was appreciated"
4792,Paula,2022-06-02,"Superb Clean rooms, comfortable and value for money"
4793,Louise,2022-06-02,"Ideal location beside airport but very expensive. Perfect location, good room. Restaurant food below par for this standard of hotel. Overpriced."
4794,Linda,2022-06-02,great proximity to Bristol Airport the location to Bristol airport only stayed overnight so no comments
4795,Claire,2022-05-31,Superb The staff were friendly and the hotel was very comfortable and clean. Our 2nd stay at this hotel and would stay again and recommend We were pleased with everything
4796,Peter,2022-05-31,"Convenient for the airport not best value Everything was as expected, check in very smooth The reception area was very busy with no real 'restaurant' didn't look to see if menu had changed"
4797,David,2022-05-31,comfortable and great location all ok nothing
4798,Christine,2022-05-31,"Walking distance to the airport terminal at Bristol Right next to Bristol airport, it only took 3 minutes to walk there for a very early flight. We had to leave too early to get breakfast!"
4799,Ros,2022-05-30,Very good staff on reception especially 30/5/22 08.30 ? Muni poor breakfast especially sausages
4800,Andrew,2022-05-30,"Superb Close to the airport, clean helpful staff A greater choice on the menu would be good"
4801,Lucie,2022-05-30,"comfortable but dining experience could be better very convenient - 2mins walk to airport Food was expensive for what was provided (quality / taste / portion size), if better quality price would be reasonable."
4802,Malcolm,2022-05-30,Very good proximity to airport
4803,Sarah,2022-05-30,Superb literally next to the airport so perfect for catching an early flight. Breakfast available from 4am! comfortable bed nothing really
4804,Jo,2022-05-29,early morning flight makes a pre flight hotel essential. located on the main Bristol Airport site. a short walk from the terminal. as the airport struggles to administer flights a pre flight hotel is essential. early morning flights are severely impacted. travel to the airport the night before and maximise your sleep. the staff at the hotel are warm and welcoming it's a shame that that the hotel fails to deliver the basics: bed - wobbles around shower - cold
4805,Cindy,2022-05-28,"when your late flight is delayed by 2.5 hours and you arrive at 2.30 am, it was so lovely to be welcomed by a very frien perfect for staying after returning from holiday on a late flight nothing"
4806,Jayne,2022-05-28,but worth it proximity to airport bit pricey
4807,Gregg,2022-05-27,End of holiday stay Extremely convenient location only 2 minutes from the terminal. Expensive. I would definitely consider somewhere a lot cheaper and pay for a taxi.
4808,Peter,2022-05-27,Excessive price Cleanliness and location Price excessive
4809,Kelly,2022-05-27,Superb Convenient for airport Restaurant was very basic
4810,Joanne,2022-05-27,"lovely friendly staff, clean comfortable rooms everything, no complaints I have no complaints"
4811,Steven,2022-05-27,"Airport hotel Ability to get up and go to the airport at 4am without the need for transfers. Pre packed breakfast bags for our collection on reception. Very quiet room which had all the facilities and was spotless. Long queue for the bar so we did not bother to have our nightcap, not enough staff (or under-trained) which caused this problem and delayed check in as well. No adequate signage from the multi storey car park which meant a long walk in the rain to find the hotel entrance."
4812,Rachael,2022-05-26,"location great , early start breakfast no real option and no staff to help with breakfadt bags location no breakfast choice at 3am ( as its an airport hotel i am sure most visitors have an early start at the airport thats why they are staying)"
4813,Philip,2022-05-25,Very good as always Good service as usual. right hotel in the right place. dinner menu quick service but poor choices
4814,David,2022-05-25,Expensive way to reduce stress of early start. Provided packed breakfast for early start. Price.
4815,Kate,2022-05-25,Bedroom was clean and well appointed. The bar / restaurant area is soulless and the staff were disorganised. At leas Fantastic location to Bristol Airport. The bar / restaurant service was really poor with long queues in order to be served.
4816,Elaine,2022-05-25,Just what was needed pre and post holiday Fantastic bed-huge! Great shower Quiet Great breakfast choice On site Food was reasonably priced and good Had 2 visits either side of holiday and air con on first stay far too cold-think engineers were working on it
4817,Jackie,2022-05-24,Superb We were still greeted by friendly staff after delayed flight at 2.00 am
4818,Dika,2022-05-24,"Superb breakfast very good, lots of choice"
4819,Michelle,2022-05-24,"Convenient for airport, breakfast good, bar evening meal poor standard. Up to early for breakfast this stay, but have had breakfast at hotel previously and breakfast is good, did order an evening meal and it was definitely below standard very disappointed. Evening meal very poor, not a fresh cooked meal at all."
4820,Karen,2022-05-23,"Absolutely fabulous! Great location exceptionally clean quiet rooms. Very comfortable bed! dreamy shower. Good value food. Crazy queues for check in this could be improved. I initially felt put off as it was the first opinion of hotel, however everything improved from this point onwards."
4821,Mark,2022-05-23,"Good, not great Location for airport could not be better. Brand new hotel, everything clean and tidy Slow check in, cott not in room when requested and when delivered dumped in room hallway without being able to get it past the bed and into the room. Breakfast bags provided for those departing before 4am, but no pre-orders taken for these. None left when we got to the lobby so we had to go without."
4822,William,2022-05-23,Good to have hotel provide dinner and breakfasts so near to the terminal. check in and check out breakfast set up able to walk to terminal Short staffed at dining. Only one person. sometimes 2 who took orders and then had to fill the drinks before being able to attend to next person in line. Waiting in line took long.....15 + minutes to be. More staff at dinner time to handle the number of customers. dinner was brought to table efficiently and was a good curry dinner.
4823,Heather,2022-05-23,Comfortable stay Clean and comfortable and very close to the airport which is helpful when catching an early flight. Nothing
4824,Becky,2022-05-23,Good Lovely room with easy and quick access to the airport. Bar was understaffed meaning there was a long queue for food and drinks. Evening meal wasnt the best quality but the buffet breakfast was outstanding. Think it is a little bit overpriced but we would stay again.
4825,Jill,2022-05-22,"Convenient for the airport, great breakfast Close to airport for late arrivals. Great breakfast. Nothing"
4826,Nigel,2022-05-22,Satisfactory. Good location for the airport. Breakfast (although early 6.30am had no eggs!). Otherwise all ok.
4827,Ian,2022-05-22,excellent design nil
4828,Chris,2022-05-22,Superb Location Comfortable rooms Good choice on breakfast Not a good choice for evening menu. Needed more variety
4829,Linda,2022-05-22,Good Good choice of breakfast When we were booked in the rate on the sign in sheet was completely wrong and if I hadny noticed it I would have been charged ¬£80 more than I was expecting Not a good start
4830,Richard,2022-05-22,Fine ! Pleasant & helpful staff. Proximity to airport Only 2 tissues left in box !
4831,Tina,2022-05-21,Pretty good but the early breakfast should be out earlier Not much Fruit still frozen in middle and yogurt poor taste
4832,Yvonne,2022-05-21,It was fine for our purpose but the food needs stepping up. Happy with the room and service. The food is appalling and we‚Äôre not fussy eaters. It was just the same the last time we stayed.
4833,Clare,2022-05-21,"Good Excellent location. Good size room and friendly staff. I would happily stay there again. There was an issue at check in, all the computers were down which caused a delay. This was not the fault of the staff, who were trying their best to deal with the situation in a polite and friendly manner, however after a long day of travelling and arriving quite late, it added to my tiredness!"
4834,Kate,2022-05-21,"Great location for airport Excellent location. Nice staff. Lovely breakfast options. Perfect for the airport, literally 5 mins walk"
4835,M,2022-05-20,Very good Staff were very welcoming and helpful on arrival and departure. The room was perfectly adequate for our needs and was very quiet - which was unexpected and very welcome. The breakfast was fine with a varied choice. I was impressed with the electronic noticeboard in the breakfast/lounge area that listed flight arrivals and departures - it appeared to be the same as the one used in the airport. The pillows. I prefer a slim to medium thickness pillow. The 2 pillows provided were much thicker than I'd prefer.
4836,Kitti,2022-05-19,"Superb The self-service breakfast was excellent. So many choices, and using a tray made everything easier. Just like in the good old days at school. I hope the management appreciates the staff."
4837,Sharon,2022-05-19,"functional, let‚Äôs face it who chooses to stay in an airport hotel?! the staff were young and lovely even when clearly pushed by so many visitors house keeping need to hoover under the beds! I also would have loved a non caffeine late night drink - herb teas?"
4838,David,2022-05-19,Superb convenient location for early departure or a late arrival ‚Ä¶ staff very friendly
4839,William,2022-05-19,Great for overnight stay before early flight. Really handy for overnight before we flew and we could check our luggage in the night before. Made the whole security check much easier as did the paid for fast track. Very busy bar service for both drinks and food as the hotel doesn't have a restaurant as such. The staff were doing their very best but they had a lot of people to serve.
4840,Rosalind,2022-05-19,convenient location price
4841,Lewis,2022-05-19,Very good It was in a good location to get to the airport for an early flight. The food menu seemed limited and they didn‚Äôt accept cash. It was my understanding that cash was still legal tender ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4842,Scott,2022-05-18,splendid stay here before my flight room very smart and clean shower was cheap
4843,Julie,2022-05-18,"Very convenient location. Very close to airport terminal. Basic , reasonably comfortable room. Convenient! Pillows were terrible.. flat and hard. Nobody answered at reception on repeat calls to change them/ get more."
4844,David,2022-05-18,Very convenient and practical Position
4845,Laurence,2022-05-17,"Generally good room but breakfast disappointing. Excellent location. Breakfast was quite disappointing, no staff, no fried eggs, fruit salad was clearly from a low range catering tin. Layout not intuitive at all. The shower in the room did not drain fast enough to prevent overflow."
4846,Mark,2022-05-17,"Nice and convenient for the airport, slightly overpriced though.... Hotel nice and quiet and really handy if you have an early morning flight and need are travelling to the airport the day before. Check in took absolutely ages as the payment systems were down. Eventually got booked into my room and the payment was taken during the early hours of the next morning. Once I got to my destination country I had a notification off my card provider to say the hotel had taken the same payment again. So did the person I was travelling with. Could not get hold of them by phone so upon arrival back to Bristol Airport had to physically go in the hotel wait for ages in the que and then take the issue up with the person on the check in desk. It was resolved but was hassle I could have done without."
4847,Barbara,2022-05-17,"excellent , staff were so helpfull location nothing"
4848,Neil,2022-05-17,"Superb Close to terminal and parking, good clean hotel with cooked breakfast."
4849,Mike,2022-05-17,"All good apart the pillows! Member of staff at front desk very good, great ambassador for Hilton well done"
4850,Julie,2022-05-17,"Perfect place for an early flight. Close to the airport, room was very clean Very busy reception with only one person in check-in."
4851,Susan,2022-05-16,"Stay would I have been marked better if evening food menu better Room clean. Early serving of breakfast. Location Evening meal menu disappointing, service station, fast food the only option"
4852,Robert,2022-05-16,Over all satisfactory The location was central to my travel and it worked out well The Parking. Unfortunately having to pay for parking is a massive dissapointment. In Ireland the one good thing is people staying in the hotel have free parking. This was also not advertised that you had to pay the parking and if it was not for the staff explaining how to do the parking I would have ended up with a large unexpected bill. The bar was cashless. The other issue was the bar/restaurant was cashless. If you did not have a credit card then you could not purchase any food or drink.
4853,Zena,2022-05-15,Very good  Price doubled since my stay in Jan 2022
4854,Colin,2022-05-15,It was good apart from the pillows Good The pillows are awful
4855,David,2022-05-15,all in all fine would stay again directions from air terminal no lights on the floor from lift could not see directions to room number
4856,Christopher,2022-05-15,Good proximity to airport very pricey for no frills accommodation
4857,Lisa,2022-05-15,"Very good The location for a very early flight the following day.The room was very clean and comfortable When we stayed before, we were able to have a continental breakfast, but the time that starts appear to have changed, so unable to have it as our check in was at 0400 which was a shame"
4858,Martino,2022-05-15,"Superb Very nice room, spacious and clean. Few steps from the airport, it's ideal to catch early morning flights"
4859,Angela,2022-05-14,we were only there a few hours as we had to be at the airport for 3am so no time for breakfast it is so close to the airport the price
4860,Alison,2022-05-13,"Superb Size and comfort of beds, good breakfast selection, helpful friendly staff."
4861,Barrie,2022-05-13,great location and reasonably priced handy for the airport and parking beds a little too hard for us
4862,Kamila,2022-05-13,Place to sleep but not to eat Everything apart from food. Food.
4863,Kathleen,2022-05-12,Convenient stopover but at a price. Within walking distance of Bristol airport. Modern hotel. Nice food. Our pre booked cot for baby wasn‚Äôt in room. Only towels for one person in twin room. Pricey.
4864,Cheryl,2022-05-12,great very modern and close to the airport
4865,Wendy,2022-05-12,"Perfect short stay before early flight. So convenient for a very early flight at the airport. Room and shower room modern, well equipped and comfortable. Good evening meal and could even take some breakfast with us. A bath would have been nice as well as a shower."
4866,Samantha,2022-05-12,"would definitely stay again friendly staff, convenient location. slippery shower tray. drinks on the bar were expensive. bed a little too hard."
4867,Mario,2022-05-12,Good  The way that the food section operated. We had ordered some fish and chips. Fish was not cooked properly. Waited ages and then we were told it could be cooked again I said we will get a sandwich from Airport no offer of a refund!! Totally unprofessional . The room excellent very clean even showerhead . Check in professional and friendly . The above was a big let down
4868,Geoffrey,2022-05-12,"Very good location for airport very quiet slept well. Didn't have breakfast was an early morning flight We asked for an early morning call which we didn't get, we asked at reception and they said the phone in our room didn't work. Not very good!!"
4869,Jayne,2022-05-12,"fully recommend this hotel for airport stay excellent location for travelling, staff were very helpful poor choice of food for evening meal"
4870,Robert,2022-05-11,"Very good Lovely atmosphere, comfortable room, friendly staff. Breakfast included in room price but not available for us as we had a 6am flight as our flight was at 6am and we had to leave the hotel before breakfast. Therefore paid for something that wasn't available. No option when booking room to not pay for breakfast."
4871,Jennifer,2022-05-11,"Superb Lovely room, easy walking distance to the terminal The food was good - we both had a curry. We will stay there again."
4872,Phillip,2022-05-11,"clean, tidy, comfortable hotel that does what it says! clean and functional. friendly welcome by the check in staff having to cue up to order evening meal and drinks. not the greatest way to start a holiday but I guess this property is simply a transit stay for early morning next day flights. the smell of burnt toast at 5am in the morning was also a bit off putting."
4873,Jeff,2022-05-11,"Superb Location convenience, Room excellent Staff very helpful"
4874,David,2022-05-09,our stay was short but food was good and easy access to airport very close to the airport for early am flight nothing
4875,Eleanor,2022-05-08,Very good Great room location Price time of breakfast
4876,John,2022-05-07,"Decent stay at Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport Check in was excellent, really attentive, genuinely friendly and helpful. I travel a lot and so often reception and check in is awful. It's the first contact the guest has with the hotel and important to be right. Room was comfortable, clean and generally quiet. Asked for a quiet room away from lift traffic and was accommodated. Food ordering system and other pushy customers jumping the queue. Appeared that some groups had package holiday vouchers which, to them, meant entitlement and special treatment. It's a package holiday airport hotel so I suppose that is to be expected. Food was OK, bar team very helpful given the circumstances."
4877,Frank,2022-05-07,"great hotel for early or late airport arrival quick check in, good breakfast and nice rooms"
4878,Jean,2022-05-07,"Very good Airport, room and breakfast good value"
4879,Ian,2022-05-07,"Very good Location excellent, cleanliness and comfort of bed. Good sound insulation No body shower gel / soap in container. No bottle water in room. Menu was abysmal ,too basic and limited."
4880,Peter,2022-05-06,"Comfortable. and efficient but tooo expensive It was comfortable and efficient with helpful, The location was ideal. It was far too expensive and I would not book there again"
4881,Nigel,2022-05-06,"Great overnight stay for an early morning flight. Friendly and welcoming staff, good food, comfortable room. The location is brilliant with just a short walk to the airport terminal building. Nothing"
4882,Heather,2022-05-06,Superb Easy checkin. Room perfect for family of 3 Beds comfortable and spotlessly clean Also so close to airport for an early flight Nothing
4883,Kevin,2022-05-05,So comfortable and convenient for an early flight. Hot Breakfast is very good. Early cold breakfast is available from 4.00 hrs for early flights. Evening meal is very limited and is obviously frozen and microwave/oven but nicely presented. There is a bar which includes limited draught beers.
4884,Russell,2022-05-05,"Very nice hotel, great location, but the price had gone up a lot The airport location, cleanliness and staff friendliness were excellent The price had gone up significantly compared to other times I've booked this."
4885,Barbara,2022-05-04,convenient and adequate the location and ease of arrival the fan in the bathroom ran noisily all night.
4886,Susan,2022-05-04,"Comfortable, good welcome but could have done more for very early morning flight food Good location The hotel were fully aware of earlier check outs ,telling us to get to the airport by 4am but breakfast started at 4am so in my opinion knowing the ongoing problems at airports ,should have had 3.30am access to continental breakfast at least or bread roll jam and butter in room come on Hampton !"
4887,Mike,2022-05-04,Superb Spacious clean hotel right at the airport. .Early check-in was a bit annoying. We had to join the Hilton club to check-in early.
4888,Clare,2022-05-03,"Comfortable stay, very convenient for airport Location Arrangements for evening meal"
4889,Crampton,2022-05-03,"I would definitely stay again Reception staff on checking in were excellent, and very helpful."
4890,Veronica,2022-05-02,Good  Couldn't open the windows!
4891,Ghislaine,2022-05-02,Superb The location is perfect if you need to stay near the airport. The room are comfortable and clean. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was good. All in all very good value for money.
4892,Lam,2022-04-30,Really nice but except for not having toothpastw big rooms no toothbrush and toothpaste
4893,Stephen,2022-04-30,"very convenient for airport, clean modern hotel very convenient for airport"
4894,Barbara,2022-04-28,"Late night arrival hotel stay The location is ideal for a very late arrival flight. The room is clean and the bed comfy. Lots of choice at breakfast. I received many messages to use the online key, but it wouldn't activate, although I continued to receive more messages to use it. The cooked breakfast is luke warm and over cooked."
4895,Linda,2022-04-28,Very good Location is excellent. Room very clean. Evening meal starter and main were both lukewarm. Breakfast no eggs. Not enough room at side of bed.
4896,Sarah,2022-04-28,"Superb Breakfast was good, we left early so only had the continental but good choice"
4897,Julie,2022-04-27,Superb Ideal for overnight stay before flight Food selection is slightly limited
4898,Gemma,2022-04-27,good location all fine
4899,Penny,2022-04-27,"very handy for airport, only scrambled eggs at breakfast near airport food not great"
4900,Jeffrey,2022-04-27,We enjoyed our stay but we found it expensive and would only use it on certain occasions. Continental breakfast adequate. The position to the airport was perfect and the room was adequate for the night and very clean. It is a Hotel that is used by the airport passenger and as such is very good.
4901,Kim,2022-04-26,"Expensive for what it was 2 minutes walk to airport terminal iron, ironing board & hairdryer in room. Quiet room, great shower. room had everything needed for 1 night stay Wake up call not received, could have missed flight had we not set alarm on phone Early morning breakfast is buffet which is to be expected at 4.30am but breakfast area very messy. Evening meal was poor"
4902,Iwona,2022-04-26,"Superb Nice, clean and comfortable room in good location"
4903,Mrs,2022-04-26,"Perfect for a relaxed, comfortable pre flight stay. Easy check in, comfortable and quiet room. Good food menu although several items were out of stock. What we had was very nice, however. Nicely stocked bathroom, comfy mattress so we slept well and it was a fast check out. Also able to walk to the airport easily. One long queue to order food and drink which meant we couldn't be bothered to order more drinks. One lady decided to walk over to the airport to get something instead."
4904,Philip,2022-04-26,Superb convenient for the airport very quiet pricey
4905,Juan,2022-04-25,Good Breakfast cold and not fresh at 7am. Poor facilities upon arrival 10pm. Rather expensive for what is no more than a premier inn type hotel. See above
4906,Leonard,2022-04-25,"Reasonable, but overpriced stay Excellent location on the airport site Very expensive for an airport hotel"
4907,Bernard,2022-04-24,Great location BUT.. .V convenient for the terminal V limited food choice in the restaurant. Carpet in the room was dirty and beneath the bed was unsavoury. No trolleys available at the hotel to transport luggage to the terminal. No instructions for using the heating system.. it was either too hot or too cold. It was always noisy.
4908,Cheryl,2022-04-24,"Good place to stay for Bristol airport, would recomend. Easy check in, with friendly staff and a nice welcome. Parking was easy. Communication before arrival was excellent. Cleanliness of room was excellent and comfortable bed. An extra pillow would have been nice. The coffee and tea tray would have benefitted from a biscuit as well. No internet charging socket was available which would have been really useful."
4909,Holly,2022-04-22,"Would book again, hopefully they will sort out the breakfast issue. Good location, nice rooms which were all very clean. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was dry and unappealing even though I came down 10 min after it was served. They didn‚Äôt have lids on the food under the heat lamps so the eggs, mushrooms etc had all dried out."
4910,Tegid,2022-04-22,Excellent location. We will certainly stay there again if we fly from Bristol Rooms are well designed Breakfast was OK but after a week in nice Spanish hotels was a bit of a let down
4911,Chejon,2022-04-21,Very good üëçüëç
4912,David,2022-04-21,"A really great way to start our visit after a flight and journey. Easy transfer from arrivals to hotel, staff helpful, welcoming, nice food and drink in evening, great breakfast.Room comfortable and clean just what we needed to start our visit to UK. Can't really find any fault."
4913,Margaret,2022-04-21,"excellent , fulfilled the purpose proximity to airport. wonderful breakfast included and served from 4 am no views from bedroom window"
4914,Caroline,2022-04-20,Great location for early flights from Bristol airport. Great location on site at Bristol airport - just a few minutes walk to terminal. Rooms were better than expected - comfy beds and good shower. No bags available for the grab and go breakfast and we didn‚Äôt have time to eat in. Quite expensive for a family for one short night.
4915,Lewis,2022-04-19,Fabulous Easy to get to and very convenient for the airport in the morning. The bar closed at 10 and then after was only room service. No parking packages so you can only leave your car for the duration of your stay. (Previously this was different)
4916,Jacqueline,2022-04-19,"Very good Food was excellent and staff were helpful and friendly Only one pillow, and the one pillow we had was too soft"
4917,Ian,2022-04-19,pleasant stay what I expected location menu could have been better
4918,Rosalind,2022-04-19,Best option for getting some sleep before/after late/early flights Convenience second to none. Staff always friendly. Great that you accommodate families with children in a room with a sofa bed; if you ever stopped doing that we would look elsewhere!
4919,Mark,2022-04-19,Very good Really helpful
4920,Esther,2022-04-18,Superb A few minutes walk from the terminal so ideal for an early morning flight. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Breakfast served from 4am.
4921,Terrence,2022-04-18,Very good Location is perfect for a short walk to the terminal and also to the long stay and multi story carparks. Great breakfasts. The dinner food.
4922,Sabine,2022-04-17,"good sleep, good breakfast, very relaxed arriving at the airport. 5 min Walk to the airport, perfect for an early departure or late arrival. the room was nice with a sofa that opened for a bed. breakfast starts as early at 4, the cooked breakfast at 6. we had time for the English breakfast and enjoyed it. we heard no planes in the room. the bed felt really uncomfortable, but we still slept really good. I found it quite expensive but I guess the easy airport access makes a part up fort it."
4923,Sue,2022-04-17,Very good where it‚Äôs situated not enough pillows please pop more on
4924,Sarah,2022-04-17,"Good location for the airport as just a short walk but you are paying a premium for the convenience The hotel was really near the airport and had ample parking. Breakfast was available for early travellers. It was expensive for just one night as not a high brow hotel. The food was pretty basic, you could tell came from a supermarket, but cooked well."
4925,David,2022-04-16,Very satisfactory and the discount on overnight parking was much appreciated Good breakfast The eating area a bit utilitarian and the tables seemed sticky
4926,Bowler,2022-04-16,Easter 2022 The food was excellent. Very clean and the staff were very nice Nothing for the children to do. It would have been nice to have a adventure play ground or something where the children could remove some of there excessive amount of energy
4927,Jane,2022-04-16,Good start to the holiday. Fairly good choice. Available to take away at 4am which was very good. Very little choice for evening meal.
4928,Tracey,2022-04-16,"Very good It's a great location, clean and comfortable The exterior automatic doors weren't working. There was no sign to explain that, they were very difficult to open and even the staff didn't comment or apologise"
4929,Lleucu,2022-04-15,Good convenient and close to airport uncomfortable pillows
4930,Melanie,2022-04-15,value for money clean near to airport nothing
4931,Tony,2022-04-15,"Great location, we started our holiday feeling refreshed after a great nights sleep. great location tables remained uncleaned throughout the evening and breakfast sitting."
4932,Alex,2022-04-14,Very good Good stay for early flight next morning
4933,Dawn,2022-04-14,"Peaceful, comfortable retreat. Loved that it was within walking distance of the airport terminal and yet was remarkably quiet - inside you could not hear all the planes landing and taking off at all hours. My international flight was at 6am so I had to be at the terminal at 4am and was too early for any breakfast."
4934,Joanna,2022-04-12,convenient close to terminal bed like rock black mould inside shower screen at the base
4935,Jones,2022-04-11,"Very good Convenient for airport Outward - 5.15am no croissants. Homeward-cooked breakfast cold and hard food. Not enough staff, they were really busy 1 staff on reception but a phone call took them away and left people waiting. 1 staff on drink/food, needs 2"
4936,Alastair,2022-04-09,"Good clean, quiet, and close to airport water not hot, just tepid, in the morning!"

4938,Ann,2022-04-09,"Perfect for an airport stopover. We arrived very early in the r morning and were leaving again soon after. the staff wer 2 minutes walk from the terminal, early breakfast on offer would have been nice to have had bottled water in the room"
4939,Jane,2022-04-08,Very good Convenient for airport and parking Restaurant and menu rather basic.
4940,Laura,2022-04-08,"Modern hotel with lovely staff, could improve menu options The front desk staff were super friendly and went above and beyond to ensure we didn't pay any extra for parking or late checkout. Even though there was no room service available we asked the staff and they allowed us to collect the food from the restaurant and take it back to the room with us. The room was modern and clean, we weren't woken up by any noise from the airport or other guests. The complementary breakfast had everything you could want. There weren't a tonne of food options for the evening meal, mostly fast food like burgers, pizza, potato wedges, and a daily dish (one meat, one vegan). Because of the location there aren't any other places to eat, so you're really stuck with just the selection there."
4941,Sophie,2022-04-08,Much better than I ever expected Close to airport Nothing
4942,Jacqueline,2022-04-07,Good Close to airport and good breakfasts

4948,Peter,2022-04-05,Very good Easy access to Parking and airport. Shower didn't drain. No one in reception to tell Couldn't find a phone number to call them. Room 269.
4949,Anne,2022-04-04,"A decent sleep before driving home It was good to be able to stay overnight after a long day before driving home. The hotel is close to the terminal and car park so it doesn't take long to reach either on foot. Dinner and breakfast both OK but not special, staff friendly and room comfortable. Our room was quite far from reception and we were tired. When we stayed the night before departure we were on the ground floor quite close to reception which would have better suited a couple of pensioners!"
4950,Hemina,2022-04-04,"The breakfast is good, the rooms are quiet and it‚Äôs a short walk to the airport. Convenient to the airport"
4951,Frances,2022-04-03,"Convenient but expensive The convenience of being at the airport for an early morning flight The room is much more expensive,than it was I would be unlikely to book here again"

4954,Annabel,2022-04-03,"A great airport hotel, super service and very clean rooms which are a step up from a standard hotel. We didn‚Äôt manage breakfast as early check in, but the ease of parking, getting to the hotel from the carpark and then the terminal from the hotel was fantastic. The rooms were lovely too. Dinner was great in the hotel restaurant. I don‚Äôt have suggestions"
4955,Olivia,2022-04-03,convenient but little soul adjacent to airport not much character in rooms. The woodwork was like Travelodge
4956,Kim,2022-04-02,too tired to return to desk to devise re bloody tissue in lift otherwise okay close to airport really lovely toiletries accessible shower was amazing great choice at breakfast easy check in/check out Blood stained (what looked like) tissue in one of lifts. One pillow each which was far too soft. Being charged ¬£5 to come into car park to collect bags even tho we had been on long stay car park for one week already.
4957,George,2022-04-01,Superb Location is fine for the airport but price was a bit dear
4958,Nathan,2022-03-31,"Very good Great staff and also breakfast, a short stay but comfortable bed. Would have been nice if the heating had been on as it was a cold night in and out"
4959,Stuart,2022-03-31,convenient convenient understaffed
4960,Karen,2022-03-31,"Good location being woken up at 11 pm by reception asking what our booking reference was because they had allocated us the wrong room, we we up at 3am for a flight. As you can appreciate it was very difficult for us to go back to sleep. Plus no cash !!!!!"

4968,Richard,2022-03-28,Serves the purpose we stayed for with early morning flight Location to airport. Very early breakfast available. Some of the elecrtrics in the room did not work but there were plenty of spare sockets

4972,Collins,2022-03-26,Very good Good It was okey
4973,Elaine,2022-03-25,"Great location, clean rooms, pleasant staff. The location is second to none, staff are very pleasant and the rooms are spotlessly clean. We were taking an early morning flight and were very disappointed that there were no paper cups for us to get a coffee ‚Äòon the go‚Äô as there have been in the past - so no breakfast for us either as we don‚Äôt eat pastries. The hotel also needs some lighting to the outside of the main doors, it was very dark out there!"
4974,Gillian,2022-03-24,"ideal place to stay before an early morning flight. hotel well located, very well appointed with clean comfortable room location close to airport"

4980,Dawn,2022-03-23,ok for a stop over ideal location. right next to the airport and long stay car park limited early breakfast but it was ok. sofa bed was horrendous though! ok for a small kid but mine is 17 and was very uncomfortable. it was extremely thin
4981,Dawn,2022-03-23,nice staff clean and ok for a night stop over location is perfect for going away. it‚Äôs also right next door to the long stay car park and airport entrance limited food choice and breakfast is a little basic but it‚Äôs ok for a travellers stop over
4982,Tracey,2022-03-23,"Excellent quality hotel at a reasonable price considering its 2 minutes walk from the airport Lovely chatty reception staff. Room spotless and comfortable and not too hot ! Breakfast was varied and fresh Room, pillows too hard and no choice of softer ones in room. No staff available to answer a question either at the desk or on the phone (05.15hrs)"
4983,Andrew,2022-03-22,convenient and comfy it was convenient and comfy
4984,Margaret,2022-03-21,"Great location and comfortable room but dire dining Pleasant clean and modern room, very quiet and comfortable. Breakfast is laid on from 4am, hot food from 6am and you can take away portable items if you don‚Äôt have time. Very close to airport terminal. The food and dining experience was on the level of a motorway services, and not the good services like Gloucester and Tebay either. You are effectively eating in the foyer, unable to get away from screens with football and the food itself is barely edible and certainly not wholesome, being largely white carb. The red lentil Dahl for ¬£12.95 was very overpriced, devoid of flavour or spice. The felafel burger was also a very long way from the original concept. There is no signage to the hotel if you want to find a pedestrian/wheeled luggage route from the long stay car park to the hotel. If you are foolish enough to consider dropping off passengers and luggage before parking think again as a van patrols the airport looking for reasons to dine you ¬£100. Happily we could park near enough in the end."
4985,Bryan,2022-03-21,well worth stay On-site for early morning flight nothing to fault
4986,Gill,2022-03-21,convenient. close to the airport Grandaughter dropped as off and having to pay ¬£5 for 5minutes parking.

4998,Gordon,2022-03-16,"Very good Location, hotel new and still modern. Drop off parking fee's of ¬£5.00 to drop my family off and then go to the long stay car park. Was only in the car park for 60 seconds max."
4999,Vanessa,2022-03-16,"It did the trick! The room was spacious, warm and comfortable. Really good facilities. We had supper which was fine and did what we needed it to do. We missed out on breakfast as we needed to get to the airport 2 hours before the 6 a.m. flight - never mind. I think windows not opening for me was the one thing I would have liked as I always sleep with a window open no matter what the weather is like. Circulating fresh air is always best."
5000,Ian,2022-03-15,"Good hotel, perfect spot, don't plan to leave your car there Simple, clean and as you would expect for a Hampton by the airport, breakfast was good and the room was comfortable. A bottle of water in the room is surely a basic expectation. Possibly my naivety, but I read the parking fee is a reduced ¬£8 a day flat rate if you stay here, so planned to leave the car there for the 2 nights we were away, but its only ¬£8 for the nights you stay there, then it jumps to ¬£45, then ¬£19 a night, so don't plan to leave your car here for your trip."
5001,Katrina,2022-03-14,Perfect for what we wanted for one night and an early start Ideal location for airport and long stay parking Menu in restaurant could be more varied but

5005,Xabiahelen,2022-03-13,Good hotel and perfect for Bristol airport. We didn't have breakfast as we had to be at the airport for 5.25am. Being so close to the terminal was good and only took us 5 minutes to walk there with our luggage. The room was comfortable but a little too cool for my husband.
5006,Katherine,2022-03-12,Great hotel for the airport Really friendly helpful staff. Comfy room and proximity to the terminal Nothing
5007,David,2022-03-12,"Very good Good location for early flight. Drainage problem in shower, but fixed quickly. Small double bed, not a king-size."

5010,Juliet,2022-03-11,"Excellent location and super level of comfort, brilliant value breakfast was excellent. Room was smart and very comfortable, excellent bathroom. Would have been great to have a hot breakfast before 7 would be good for early winter flights."

5015,Samantha,2022-03-09,"Excellent start and finish to our week away. Thank you Hilton!! Breakfast, dinner, surroundings, room, cleanliness, location, staff ... not much to not like!! The only thing - more pillows. Only two for two of us - it'd be great if two more could be kept in the wardrobe in case your guests need more."
5016,Sharon,2022-03-08,Good Hotel Relaxing hotel Being messaged at 1.30 a.m with our final bill when having to get up for flight at 4 a.m couldn't get back to sleep
5017,David,2022-03-08,They knew about hygiene standards to the highest within my room .. Receptionist welcome very warm friendly too.great at her job .
5018,David,2022-03-08,It was the ideal option for us that fitted in with the travel plans Being so close to the airport Bar area - difficulty establishing availability of meal facilities / menu online... beforehand. Contacting hotel.
5019,John,2022-03-08,perfect location to overnight prior to early morning flight new and fresh nothing
5020,Michael,2022-03-08,very good. We will use it every time we have an early morning flight now modern clean and near airport I thought the car park would be free but reasonable overnight rate of ¬£8
5021,Carol,2022-03-08,very pleasant and super comfy bed! great place to stay actually on the airport!
5022,Brendan,2022-03-07,Perfectly adequate hotel for a short stay either coming from or going to airport for onward trave Breakfast was very good with lots of choice for the price paid. Particularly liked the quality of the coffee which was excellent. Only one quibble - could have had some extra pillows in the room. My wife usually requires additional pillows due to a health condition.
5023,Thomas,2022-03-06,Good The doors at the entrance did not work correctly There was only two coffee machines at breakfast only one working and the second in bad repair
5024,Felicity,2022-03-06,"Very good convenient, clean only one pillow bar food was pretty dire"
5025,Carol,2022-03-06,"A perfect place to stay before our early flight. The Hampton by Hilton is situated within easy walking distance of the airport terminal. The staff are polite and efficient. The rooms are clean and comfortable and there‚Äôs a restaurant on site which is handy, serving breakfast from around 5am."
5026,Heather,2022-03-06,"Very good Hotel is walking distance from the airport terminal. Reception staff were excellent - efficient, smiling, nothing was too much trouble. They have a safe luggage room if you want to leave your bags there. Also there are airport trolleys behind the hotel which you pay for and can then you can keep the trolley and some of your bags in the reception safe luggage room. Excellent for if you have an early departure. Bar staff were very friendly. Room spacious & comfortable - no noise from the airport."
5027,Susannah,2022-03-05,Eat before you get there proximity to airport departures rooms were quiet and comfortable good was terrible. after a long drive we needed a decent meal and the food was basic and of poor quality
5028,Elizabeth,2022-03-05,"nice welcome from the receptionist good to reach a peaceful and comfortable place. room was comfortable and clean breakfast was awful. anaemic coffee. no fresh fruit salad, just tinned. scramble egg anaemic. couldn't really find anything appetising to eat"
5029,Clairino,2022-03-05,Good location  The sofa bed is uncomfortable a single bed would be better in a designated family room.
5030,Rosamund,2022-03-04,"good location. menu lets the hotel down badly. 2nd time I have said this location , clean room unimaginative menu"
5031,Peter,2022-03-04,Superb Airport location good. But no provision for family to drop me off with heavy suitcase at the reception. A drop off point outside reception?????

5033,Brian203,2022-03-03,Good Clean comfortable room. Appalling menu.
5034,Janette,2022-03-03,"Superb Excellent for location, good breakfast and comfortable room. Charging socket in room would be useful."
5035,Helen,2022-03-03,"Massively convenient hotel for Bristol airport. This airport is on the doorstep of Bristol airport - a short walk, so massively convenient. The parking at the multi-story is also convenient and although expensive, we got a reasonable deal as we pre-booked. It's a nice touch having the boards up with the flights - really helpful to know whether to walk over or wait. The signage could be better - we ended up taking a long walk detour to get to the right walkway, when we could have gone through the hotel and walked out the other side - a simple thing to rectify if the owners choose to do so!"
5036,Peter,2022-03-03,"Convenient hotel, spotlessly clean with amazing staff and a good breakfast close to Bristol Airport. The staff were really helpful and friendly at the check in. We couldn‚Äôt get a taxi to take us to Bristol Temple Meads ( Sunday 27th Feb) and they went out of their way to go and find us a taxi, calling taxi companies, going up to the airport taxi rank etc. Nothing was was too much trouble for them.

5043,Robin,2022-02-28,Very convenient place to stay to make a journey slightly more relaxed. Super close to the terminal so a very easy option for an early or late flight. The staff were good and the room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast tables could have been cleared quicker.

5060,Jo,2022-02-21,Very convenient for early flight Good choice for such an early start thank you. Some way of taking it away would have been good. The food in the evening was poor quality and poor value for money and and we had to wait for 40mins
5061,Chris,2022-02-21,"Very good Facilities and room are super. Breakfast available at 5AM, amazing. Very convenient for the airport, makes it super easy to get to your flight in the morning. The cooked food lets the hotel down, its very poor. Its not hotel standard. I'd say that even the large fast food chains provide a better quality of food."

5070,Elisabeth,2022-02-15,"We enjoyed our stay. However we felt the restaurant menu could be improved, although the staff were very helpful. Room and en-suite were very well equipped and the beds were comfortable. Walking distance to airport terminal. No night light or dimmer switch to facilitate access to bathroom at night without switching on main light which also reflects in mirror. A ramp from the hotel to the airport next to the steps would be better."
5071,Linda,2022-02-15,Very good Large single beds in twin room were very comfortable Bar area has limited seating
5072,Sean,2022-02-14,"Bristol airport hotel Room was set up as requested, and consideration was put into this request. The shower was blocked, it was really slowly draining. Not ideal."

5074,Elizabeth,2022-02-13,"Comfortable and convenient. Room. Nearness to airport. There is no courtesy bus to airport. Forced to hire taxi for a 5 min ride. Slope of hill up to airport too steep for elderly people with heavy luggage. No breakfast or even takeaway snack available for very early departures, even though it is included in the rate. Perhaps a small sealed picnic bag could be taken to room the night before an early morning departure."
5075,Craig,2022-02-13,"absolute shocking. stayed fo relieved stress if early flight and no-one on reception for 15 mins to get parking validat location procedure for ordering food and drink, very basic , un professional and staff with no knowledge or memory from order to serving within 2 minutes"

5081,Ann,2022-02-11,"Good comfortable choice if flying from Bristol Airport Friendly and helpful staff. Close to airport. Good breakfast with plenty of choice. Limited food choice in evening - but we were satisfied with baked potato, beans & salad. Access to airport with luggage for older people not so easy, but that is not the hotel's fault. Having said that, we would use again."
5082,Andrea,2022-02-10,"Short but sweet, great airport hotel. Breakfast was great, lots of choice, the staff were really friendly and the location couldn't be better placed to catch an early morning flight.

5087,Eileen,2022-02-07,"Functional and American style I liked this place, its functional for airport travellers and not really a holiday base. Great for late arrivals or very early departures. We walked from the airport and couldn't find the route so diverted a bit. Came in through the back entrance of the hotel eventually. Please ensure to signpost the walking route clearly from the airport."
5088,Nikki,2022-02-07,"Location and room were excellent. Staff were a little aloof and distracted. Not a very warm welcome Immaculate room, comfy bed, good shower Staff distracted at check in. Walked off half way through checking us in to deal with someone else. Not very welcoming or engaging"

Rooms are a little narrow and it‚Äôs quite pricey."
5091,Mj,2022-02-05,Excellent location with pleasant staff Pleasant staff and good location Overpriced for facilities provided. Excellent location but basic menu and much self service. Premier Inn is better value......

5098,Jason,2022-02-01,"Overnight stay for early flight the next morning Clean, very quiet and extremely close to the airport arrivals, literally 5 minutes up the hill. Room was quite small, also overpriced for the size. No mini bar and also no free water provided which meant we had to buy water from downstairs."
5099,Sergio,2022-01-31,"Great for location Great Location, really nice staff The food was very basic with very limited choice."
5100,David,2022-01-31,Very good Great location at Bristol Airpirt The lounge area around the bar is fine but could be a little more comfortable. I would still use this hotel and bar area though.

5102,Jacqui,2022-01-31,Superb Close to airport. Room heating good. Tv n tea making facilities and clean room. Why do you only put TWO pillows on a double bed? What adult only has one pillow each? Please rectify this and then youll be top marks.
5103,Janice,2022-01-30,Ideally suited for airport. proximity to the airport was good. Shower in bathroom was very good. the basin in the bathroom was so far back I could hardly reach to clean my teeth!

5106,Stephen,2022-01-29,"Stress free way to start my trip from Bristol Airport. So handy for the airport, will use this next time I travel. Spotlessly clean throughout, friendly and helpful staff. Really great breakfast, and pretty decent evening meal. Don‚Äôt know why the other reviewers thought the food was poor. I don‚Äôt normally spend this much on a hotel, but in fact it‚Äôs worth it for the sheer convenience."
5107,Lorraine,2022-01-29,great stopover when traveling. super comfortable beds location to airport some seats in the dining area were damaged but obviously being repaired.
5108,Andrew,2022-01-28,"Ideal airport hotel. The staff were excellent, ideal location and very clean. The menu was a but disappointing. Expected a lot more variety from a good class hotel."
5109,Richard,2022-01-28,Good  No USB points in the rooms
5110,Lee,2022-01-25,"Nice but the food was a big disappointment! Location was perfect for the airport. Nice, clean room, friendly staff We thought the evening meal choice & standard was poor, there wasn‚Äôt much on the menu that we fancied eating & the portions were small so not good quality for the money & my husband was still hungry after! The breakfast was also disappointing & not very warm at all! We really thought that the Hilton would have a much better standard of food"
5111,Mike,2022-01-24,Very good Great breakfast
5112,Patricia,2022-01-21,Great location a few minutes walk from the airport Great location within a few minutes walk from the airport.
5113,April,2022-01-21,"Excellent pre or post flight choice. Brilliant location, right opposite the multi storey car park where we had left our car, and next to the terminal. Staff friendly and welcoming. Check in and out efficient. Room was clean and pleasant. Decent shower. Didn‚Äôt eat there so can‚Äôt comment on food. Would have preferred two pillows to one soft but could presumably have gone to Reception to ask for another."
5114,Karen,2022-01-20,"Improve the pillows & it would be superb! Staff were very helpful & welcoming, everywhere was very clean, location excellent. Room was very comfortable apart from very poor quality pillow (very soft/unsupportive & only one per twin bed)"
5115,Linda,2022-01-20,Very good close to airport no trollers available nearby & quite a few steps to get to airport
5116,Sian,2022-01-19,Very good Enjoyed food selection and drinks at bar. Short walk to departures

5118,Michelle,2022-01-17,"Superb Comfortable bed, lovely hot shower, friendly staff,really great variety of breakfast. Ideal location,well efficient in regards to hygiene for covid. Room was cold. Annoyed having to walk all around the hotel because the entry signage had fallen off."
5119,Rebecca,2022-01-17,comfortable. clean. great staff clean. well kept. good fascilities the only disappointment was the crockery and utensils were not clean. which is very important especially with COVID
5120,Gillian,2022-01-16,Good Location Evening meal was basic
5121,Alan,2022-01-16,"Location is the star. We went down for breakfast at 06.30, so no hot food available for breakfast. Why can‚Äôt hot food be provided? Our bed was rather hard, also when one of us moved the other felt the bounce."
5122,Go4it,2022-01-16,"Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport - an excellent location for the airport The hotel was spotlessly clean, continental breakfast very good and excellent location for the airport. Nothing"
5123,Ann,2022-01-16,"Excellent airport hotel with great staff Comfortable room close to airport. Very friendly, helpful and professional staff. Good attention to Covid procedures. Very good breakfast with impressive choice for such an early start (4.30am was when we went) - hot breakfast starts at 6am. We checked out access to airport the day before our flight: you can get a luggage trolley from near the hotel for ¬£2 and use the ramped access to the terminal (we are in our 70s so it solved the problem of trying to lug heavy cases up flights of steps). We have booked again for our return flight."
5124,Manoj,2022-01-15,Very good close to the airport
5125,Tracey,2022-01-15,stay was perfect location was brilliant Evening meal was not great

5130,Tom,2022-01-12,"Superb The location is very handy for the airport. The room was very clean and well equip, and the staff very helpful. The food was also very good on site. Nothing, everything was up to scratch."
5131,Dawn,2022-01-12,Comfortable stay in a convenient location for Bristol Airport The hotel is very convenient for the airport for an early morning flight
5132,Simon,2022-01-12,"nice facility, clean, comfy and convenient‚Ä¶ but eat before you stay. convenience. clean, modern and just what you need for a short (overnight stay) food in the restaurant was highly processed.. didn‚Äôt think you could make a bad cheese and bacon burger, but they managed it.. beef was finely ground patty and the bacon was anaemic‚Ä¶. should be able to do much better.."
5133,Alan,2022-01-11,"Very good Proximity to airport Comfortable room Excellent breakfast Evening meal was poor value, and the frozen vegetables were cold and unappetising. The meal was not up to hotel standards. General atmosphere of the dining area was cold and spartan. Stained upholstery and inadequate cleaning by staff"
5134,Sarah,2022-01-11,"Very convenient for an early start at the airport The room was very clean and comfortable and quiet. We had the continental breakfast as we had an early flight which was very well laid out and plentiful. The pillows were too soft We had evening dinner at the hotel but it took nearly an hour to arrive, which was not good, we complained and they gave us a round of free drinks as a gesture of good will. When the food was finally served it was nice and hot."
5135,Shirley,2022-01-11,"Very convenient clean facilities and lovely staff. Staff were lovely and very helpful. Room and facilities were very clean. Very accessible for airport terminal - couldn't have been any better. Pillows were so soft they were virtually non existent. No neck support at all. No second pillows available to provide extra support. Could not lie in bed and watch TV as could not prop yourself up enough. A small gripe I know but a little bit irritating, especially when everything else was absolutely fine."
5136,John,2022-01-11,"Good quality pre-flight stopover at market price Proximity to airport terminal; positive attitude of staff; good continental breakfast available very early (from 4.00am) Very little to dislike, other than the price!"
5137,Tim,2022-01-09,Superb Very convenient for my early morning flight. Nothing
5138,Hugh,2022-01-09,Convenient and decent hotel for catching early flights. Late arrival process was excellent. Very convenient hotel for early flights.
5139,David,2022-01-09,"convenient, clean location and good facilities! clean and welcoming. Supplement to drinks in rooms ie biscuits would have been welcome after a long journey."
5140,Carol,2022-01-08,"Lovely spacious,comfortable room.Great location for early morning flight.Helpful staff .Dreadful foo I did not eat dinner or breakfast because I was so disappointed with the food during my previous stay in November 2021.The dinner was dreadful. The food."
5141,Roely,2022-01-07,Perfect for the purpose Position very close to airport.?
5142,Denise,2022-01-07,Fitted our purpose very well. Breakfast was very good. Great to accommodate early departures. My second visit and would stay again. Choice for dinner.
5143,Diana,2022-01-07,Good value and very pleasant and clean Great location for airport. Breakfast was good Would have liked natural dairy yoghurt and a sharp knife for fruit
5144,Diane,2022-01-07,Early flight so overnight stay in airport So close to airport and parking. Quiet. Nothing
5145,Lynne,2022-01-06,Very good comfy bed room too stuffy
5146,Ann,2022-01-05,"Very good Did the job for 1night. Long up hill walk to airport terminal, should provide shuttle bus."
5147,Raymund,2022-01-05,"We enjoyed the stay, the staff were excellent, the location ideal and cleanliness was superb. Breakfast was ok but if I was being honest the ingredients were quite average. The location right next to the airport was super convenient for covid testing and the flight we were taking. There was nothing much to complain about. Perhaps some extra signage to advise which exit to use for the airport when you had arrived via the car park entrance. Some extra pillows would have been nice since the booking was for a couple."
5148,Nazir,2022-01-05,Very good Clean rooms Heating in the room did not work too well. Food at the restaurant was really bad!
5149,Margaretta,2022-01-05,"Quiet rooms ,very convenient hotel ,short walk to the terminal of Bristol Airport . Excellent hotel to catch an early fl so convenient for the airport, facilities good"
5150,Markbrins,2022-01-04,Walking distance to terminal The bar prices were reasonable for both food and drinks
5151,David,2022-01-04,very clean hotel. very clean and very conveniently located downhill from the airport. not easy to carry/wheel cases uphill to the airport.
5152,Joanna,2022-01-04,"I would definitely stay at this hotel again for its convenient position close to Bristol Airport. The breakfast was a great self-service set up and good early start for those having to check-in for an early flight from Bristol Airport. A shame the waffle maker wasn't up and running early, but understandable. Having the live flight departures and arrivals information up in the restaurant area was helpful and reassuring. Initially, I was put off by the parking price information when I first arrived, but after visiting the hotel reception I learned that customers of the hotel paid a reduced overnight price which was far more bearable. It would be better if customers didn't have to pay for parking for the duration of their stay."
5153,Keith,2022-01-03,Ok Location was good did not have breakfast left to early No USB port stairs hadn‚Äôt been cleaned for a while ok
5154,Samantha,2022-01-03,"Fabulous and super friendly! We have stayed in many hotels all over the world but the customer service here was fabulous and up there with the best. So warm and genuine. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff really seem to enjoy working at the hotel and it shows. We were only at the hotel for 1 night but were made to feel so welcome from the moment we checked in. The restaurant was great too. Decent menu, service, quality and prices. It all felt very safe despite Covid and restrictions. The room was spotless. The very short distance from the airport terminal made it super convenient and there was ample parking outside. I honestly hate to leave any negative comment as the positives were so good but it would have been nice to have a bath in the room. I kind of expect that of a Hilton. The sofa bed's springs also dug in during the night but the soft quilt kind of helped detract from that!"
5155,Valerie,2022-01-03,Great for early flight Breakfast excellent No hairdryer in room
5156,Peter,2022-01-02,Short and convenient.. Flight was too early for breakfast. Hotel is convenient for early flights. Expensive
5157,Martin,2022-01-02,very convenient for airport so near the terminal very little room between the bed and the wall. the bed was very hard
5158,Nicola,2022-01-02,Perfect for what we needed and the staff were so helpful - would stay again Very clean and the staff were super helpful and friendly Food was quite basic - was ok but more choice as I would imagine a lot of people want to start a holiday staying here with a lovely meal
5159,Griffiths,2022-01-01,Superb Excellent location bang opposite Bristol airport. Great staff. Good food. Lovely shower!!! Comfy bed and quiet. One of the lifts shuddering! But apart from that all was great.
5160,Fuller,2021-12-31,Superb Clean functional room. Delicious breakfast and excellent selection. Helpful staff Furnishings were a little tired. Some carpets appear stained/dirty. Tables slow to be cleaned.
5161,John,2021-12-31,"accommodation fine but food appalling everything except the evening meal and bar At the Hampton our room and facilities were fine but the food at our evening meal was more than disappointing. It was probably the most unappetising food we have experienced. We had the falafel veggie burger described on the Menu as being with bread and butter pickle, tzatziki and chips, which were just cooked and only warm. The item came with ‚Äòsalad‚Äô, which was not described in the menu and which we were told was standard for a burger being lettuce, tomato, and onion. Not everyone likes onion and removing it from food after it has been sliced is equally unacceptable. It should be recognised on the menu, for customers to have a choice. The ‚Äòbread and butter‚Äô description was false as it was a Brioche, which is a sweet bun and totally unsatisfactory in a savoury dish. Staff and Manager were accommodating and helpful in accepting our criticism of the food. The bar serves only malt Scotch Whisky and Irish Whiskey which is an unacceptable and expensive choice when requiring a long whisky drink with a mixer ie ginger ale, where a Blended Scotch Whisky is the norm. These are supplied under numerous titles such as White&Mackay, Bells, Grouse, etc. etc. It feels like your captive audience is being held hostage."
5162,Sarah,2021-12-31,Fine for an overnight Very helpful and friendly check in from Gloria. Dining area and bar somewhat basic.
5163,Elizabeth,2021-12-30,We enjoyed another stay. It was very comfortable and welcome after a long day travelling. it‚Äôs extremely convenient if you are flying out of or into Bristol Airport I would like to know there is a courtesy bus to transfer you to and from the airport. Taxis are exorbitant and totally off the scale for such a short trip. It‚Äôs the only drawback.
5164,Dorothy,2021-12-30,excellent The location - took the stress out of an early flight nothing
5165,Andrew,2021-12-30,"Very good  Sanitation stations not filled to capacity, during the evening one was empty reported three times, and once to the Duty Manager next morning still empty 29/12/2021 reported yet again instantly changed by the morning staff. Very disgruntled that a senior team member did not follow up any action during his evening shift."
5166,Diarmuid,2021-12-28,"Very good breakfast good, location good walk to the terminal, hotel to terminal car park would help"
5167,Ana,2021-12-28,Very good How near from airport is this location. The room and the hotel were absolutely spotless. The breakfast was really nice. Just maybe the price for just one night was a bit expensive. But in general I really enjoyed my stay.
5168,Richard,2021-12-28,"Good room was good, the bed was to softened the bedding and pillows were not of a good quality the bed and the bedding, could of had a better food options, like bar baskets meals"
5169,Melanie,2021-12-27,Excellent Everyone was friendly and very helpful and the room was more than satisfying shower was excellent it was very clean to
5170,Duncan,2021-12-27,good but not without some disadvantages for passengers on very early flights convenient stay if you have an early morning flight had to leave hotel to check in for a very early flight. No coffee or snacks available although we had paid for breakfast.
5171,Elizabeth,2021-12-26,"Comfortable, friendly Location perfect for airport. Bed comfortable and quiet. Staff were very friendly. Check in and out very easy. Stains on bedroom carpet. Not enough staff, queues for the bar and to order food."
5172,Christine,2021-12-24,"Excellent place to stay when you have an early morning flight friendly staff, very comfortable, quiet room. Good evening meal and breakfast nothing"
5173,Wu,2021-12-24,Very good So close to the airport
5174,Lucy,2021-12-24,perfect for airport clean and comfortable
5175,Bill,2021-12-23,Superb How clean and spacious also right on the Airport
5176,Susan,2021-12-22,Convenient comfortable hotel to stay in for early departure from the airport. The location is excellent for the airport. Breakfast was a bit disappointing as the cooked option was late coming out & we did not have time before our check in to take advantage of it. However what was available was fine. We liked the idea that rooms were sealed after cleaning to comply with COVID regulations. Unfortunately a good number of people moving around the hotel were not wearing masks although we do realise that is something it's difficult for the hotel to enforce.
5177,Heaney,2021-12-22,Very happy. Would definitely stay again. Breakfast was great. Plenty of choice.
5178,Jo,2021-12-21,Superb So close to the airport - perfect for my early flight. They offered take away breakfast too for early flights. I didn't realise that I could park at the hotel so in future I will do that.
5179,Antony,2021-12-21,Kids in lobby  Children being allowed to run around in the lobby while others were trying to socially acceptably distance and eat or relax other guests should have been spoken to about their tolerance level of their children
5180,Jo,2021-12-20,Excellent sanctuary from stressful airport situation very convenient when my flight was cancelled. Super clean and comfortable. Spacious room Excellent breakfast a bit of interior noise
5181,Gaynor,2021-12-20,"overnight stay very good location for early morning flight food in restaurant for evening meal was very disappointing, wouldn‚Äôt eat there again. Breakfast however was of a good standard"
5182,Linda,2021-12-19,"Short and sweet. Good continental breakfast but couldn‚Äôt find any serviettes! No paper menus in the room, due to Covid restrictions."

5186,Angie,2021-12-17,"Hilton Location good , staff friendly. Food nice. Very quiet. Double bed comfy. Not cleaned properly, toilet seat had urine mark on. Shower not cleaned properly in corners. Sofa bed uncomfortable."
5187,Michael,2021-12-16,Very comfortable stay Evening meal good value and tasty. Staff pleasant and helpful. Convenient to airport terminal. upon booking it would have been helpful for guidance of location of long term car park and where best to park to reach the hotel on foot. Terminal direction signs in car park do not mention hotel and at night quite difficult to find the best pedestrian route. Now we know the layout will not be a problem in future.
5188,Keith,2021-12-16,Very good Excellent staff.Giving good service in difficult times.Early buffet breakfast very good. Prices bit high if you had family to cater for.
5189,Raymond,2021-12-15,Perfect for the airport Good room and very convenient for the airport. The cutlery at breakfast was filthy! Knives were encrusted with baked on food. Staff should be more careful when removing them from the dishwasher.
5190,Patricia,2021-12-15,Very good A great location. Overnight only for convenience to airport.
5191,Paul,2021-12-15,"excellent,no complaints. great value ,perfect location & friendly staff."

5194,Jacqueline,2021-12-12,Very convenient place to stay after a late night flight Greeted by pleasant reception staff. Room Very clean and the bed was comfortable. I had expected noise from the airport as its so near but didn't hear any noise. Good choice for breakfast
5195,Whittler,2021-12-12,"Very convenient, clean and well presented hotel Extremely convenient location situated a short walk between the multi storey car park and the terminal. Good size room, excellent bathroom. The website advised that food wasn't available in the evening so we took a prepared meal with u to eat in our room. On arrival there was clearly a good choice of food available via the bar."
5196,Noel,2021-12-11,"Perfect location, bit disappointed thereafter The location couldn't be better! The bed was very comfortable. It was expensive for what it was, I was surprised there were no USB charging points in the room. I had some time to kill in the morning before my afternoon flight and whilst waiting for my afternoon flight I ordered a tea and bottle of water which was hellish expensive and the water was only 330ml. I would have asked for a pint of tap water if I knew I'd be fleeced. Even the guy that served me seemed embarrassed."
5197,Martin,2021-12-10,Perfect night-before choice for that early flight Lovely staff. Just 5 minutes walk to airport terminal. Excellent size rooms. Limited choice of evening meal
5198,Mandy,2021-12-09,"Very convenient for airport. Proximity to airport and airport bus terminal. Very clean, quiet, great beds and bathroom. Breakfast could be of a higher quality - orange juice was like squash, croissants a bit dry, etc."
5199,Duncan,2021-12-09,Convenient and comfortable for flights into and out from Bristol. Efficient check in and out. Good breakfast. Convenient location.
5200,Shalaby,2021-12-09,Superb The locality Expensive

5203,Marilyn,2021-12-08,"Good value airport hotel, better then we thought it would be Great position on airport, very friendly staff, good sized clean room and good value, good choice for breakfast Nothing all ok"
5204,Michael,2021-12-08,"Nice hotel ruined by terrible food Room was nice and the bar was ok Food choice was appalling, what they made came out of a fryer or microwave, not befitting anything that calls itself a hotel"
5205,Terrance,2021-12-08,will definately stay again good beds very clean Packed breakfast for 6.00am departures would have been good
5206,Rhian,2021-12-06,"Would definitely recommend. The room was lovely, modern and very clean. Beds comfortable. Large walk in shower too which was great! Location was amazing. Airport a 5 min walk away. The front of desk was lovely as well. He made us feel very welcome. The food. Ordered a jacket potato it was brown ü§¢ my sister ordered a tuna sandwich and the bread was stale. Needs improving."
5207,Catherine,2021-12-06,"very convenient as close to the airport but overpriced rooms closeness to the airport, staff very helpful breakfast available from 4am great for early flights food in restaurant not good value for money, was obviously microwaved pre packaged food. Room nothing special for the money charged beds very hard"
5208,Kevin,2021-12-05,Nice but expensive The location is superb and the rooms are excellent Over 200 pounds for one night
5209,Ian,2021-12-05,The hotel is convenient for the terminal and that is reflected in the room rates. Given that a lot of guests were taking early flights the start of service should be earlier. The continental offer was average. My comments are influenced by one member of staff who was taking food and beverage orders. I was queuing behind a customer waiting to be served when she came to the counter ignored me and served the person behind me while I was still waiting. That was rude and doesn‚Äôt go down well with us Brits.
5210,Caroline,2021-12-05,Superb Location was the key factor
5211,Simon,2021-12-05,it‚Äôs an airport hotel - efficient and soulless  I know it‚Äôs in the airport but it‚Äôs still a lot of money for a room in the Bristol area
5212,Ian,2021-12-04,would stay again if using the airport close to the airport a free beer on arrival would have been nice
5213,Sarah,2021-12-04,good experience Would stay again before an early /late flight location

5216,Robertod,2021-12-02,"Great start for my daughter's graduation journey. Thank you. Roberto D It was a great choice for the location right in the airport, very convenient for leaving very early in the morning. My daughter had a great time. Nothing negative."
5217,Julie,2021-12-02,Very good Proximity of the Airport. Breakfast. Hotel food was of poor quality.
5218,Julie,2021-12-02,Overnight Airport Stay This was an overnight stay at an airport hotel. It was comfortable and close to the airport. We also got a later check out which was much appreciated. Self service breakfast was excellent. The food menu was limited the chilli I had lacked meat and taste.
5219,Peter,2021-12-01,A comfortable stay in an ideal location for an early flight. It is a shame you cannot get better food options. It is very convenient for an early flight. Food options are limited.
5220,Philip,2021-12-01,Very good as always Close to the airport - comfortable rooms. Dinner menu sparse
5221,Paul,2021-12-01,Superb Very nice
5222,Clive,2021-12-01,"Great food, lovely people, lumpy, noisy mattress. Evening meal and breakfast was hot and good quality. Chelsea was great looked after us wonderfully. It Was without doubt the worst bed I have ever slept in..the mattress was at least 50 years old.. which was strange for a new hotel. And one pillow each on the bed... really whats that about."
5223,Rosamund,2021-11-29,convenient location but seriously consider eating elsewhere excellent location for the airport particularly when you have an early flight. comfortable and quiet room & very clean. the evening menu choices are very limited. it completely lets the hotel down. The menu is not in keeping with the quality of the accommodation. For some it is the beginning of a holiday & a good meal would be a great way to start.
5224,Hazel,2021-11-29,Overall a positive experience. Breakfast was expected and good. The hotel very modern. The walk from airport arrivals lounge to the hotel late at night was dimly lit. I will be writing to the airport authorities re this. The walk ways need weatherproofing ie; covered against the rain. I will be writing to the airport authorities re this! Arrived very late due to flight delays.
5225,John,2021-11-29,"Very good Clean, modern, well located Food is poor"
5226,Rhona,2021-11-28,"It exceeded expectations & the location is ideal for the airport. The reception staff were friendly, approachable & helpful. Nothing."

5228,Reuben,2021-11-28,great burgers convenient all good
5229,Kevin,2021-11-28,IDEAL FOR AN EARLY FLIGHT AND EVEN THE 4.0 AM CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST WAS MORE THAN ADEQUATE LOCATION EVENING MENU
5230,Alan,2021-11-28,"We‚Äôve stayed here a few times and enjoyed it I‚Äôd recommend it and I‚Äôll definitely stay here again. Lovely hotel nice room good service from the checking in,staff very helpful we had early flight so missed the cooked breakfast but still plenty of choices with the continental choice,it‚Äôs so convenient with airport just across the road. nothing to say about it ,"
5231,Norma,2021-11-27,"Very pleased with the overall experience. Nice room good facilities, pleasant lounge area and restaurant. location"
5232,Andrew,2021-11-27,"Very convenient and very comfortable Staff really friendly on arrival and both my 'special requests' had been catered for. An excellent breakfast (though the scrambled egg is powdered, I think). All in all a very satisfactory stay"
5233,Jennifer,2021-11-27,"It is the best airport hotel I have stayed in. Within a few minutes walk from the airport, it is clean, comfortable, with very pleasant and helpful staff. A cold breakfast begins at 4am, which is very good. the hot breakfast begins at 6am. The room is designed to maximise the space, is clean and comfortable. It is the best airport hotel I have stayed in. Nothing."
5234,Peter,2021-11-25,"Convenient and comfortable Would have liked to have seen an opportunity to have a take away arrangement as we had an early flight and left the hotel at 05.00 am. Your dining experience needs to improve, the menu is always the same and not very exciting and of a mediocre quality."

5238,Jan,2021-11-23,"A great rest before the trip. Cosmetics with a beautiful scent, a very useful safe in the room, and the beds are very comfortable, other equipment very useful. Perfect location. The breakfast was very sparse, a small selection of cold cuts and breads and the shower water could have been a little warmer,"
5239,Martin,2021-11-23,"Staff, room and breakfast excellent but let down by the charges pending still remain Excellent Breakfast. Everything you'd want from a cooked breakfast The amount from the previous week was showing even though it was claimed by the 15th. After the stay on the 20th November 3 amounts were still showing pending. The charge was ¬£112 which has been claimed but 2 pending items remain. Not good enough 3 days after the stay."

It arrived quickly and was piping hot and immaculately served. Thank you. I am elderly and have stayed here several times as it means I can easily walk to the airport after a longish train journey, from Cornwall, then a bus trip from Temple Meads Station and it makes my life easier. I prefer to have a room with a bath, otherwise it was warm clean and comfortable. All the staff were lovely. To have a room with a bath and shower head."

5257,Kathleen,2021-11-14,Overall it was ok the location was excellent as was the Continental breakfast. Incredibly quiet. The staff were very welcoming and helpful at all times The only thing I was disappointed in there were no teabags in the room and I felt it was too late 10pm to ask staff plus I was tired but I was so looking forward to a cup of tea - small things but important at the time! Also the bins had not been emptied. When showering in the morning the water was not draining away in the tray and had to turn it off!! Room 157

5266,Tag,2021-11-11,Exactly what you want from an airport hotel. The exorbitant parking charge is the negative  The parking charge is extortionate.

5272,Janet,2021-11-08,"Would use the facility whenever flying from Bristol Airport, even if only for a coffee or snack. The proximity to the Bus Park and to the Airport. The friendlness of the staff and the superb response to our request for an additional duvet and pillow each on our arrival in the cold night on return from Tenerife, all this at about 1 am. Much appreciated. The sudden closure of the breakfast area doors without notice. We understood breakfast was from 7 till 11 but didn't expect that!"

5276,Emma,2021-11-07,"Short but sweet stay will be back. Great hotel in a very convenient location for weary travellers using the airport. Well designed, beautifully clean with all the elements needed for a restful stay. Staff were very friendly and helpful with a genuine will to want to give great customer service. My check in was the best I‚Äôve ever had in a hotel. We had to check out at 4am so was disappointed that takeaway breakfast was not available. A take away coffee would have been very welcome! If I‚Äôm unable to have time to enjoy breakfast I should be offered a reduction in rate or a takeaway."

5283,Keith,2021-11-03,Good needed more pillows the two pillows on the bed had less depth than a folded towel. whilst I realise I could have asked for more at midnight when your in bed it‚Äôs not ideal to get dressed and go and ask reception. the bathroom fan was humming all night and the shower did not drain properly. we had to wait 10 mins for the shower tray to empty before my husband could shower for fear of flooding the room .
5284,Tracey,2021-11-02,Superb ideal for a stop over before a flight. Lovely spacious rooms and a good breakfast

5288,Richard,2021-11-02,Over night stay Very close to get to the airport You had to walk outside in the rain to get to the airport and contend with stairs while carrying your cases
5289,Hem,2021-11-02,"Clean the pipes! No noise, nice and quiet. The floor of the shower cubicle got filled very quickly with water, and despite turning up the temperature for hot water it didn‚Äôt budge at all. Shame, as it could have been a better experience."

5293,Graham,2021-11-01,"first stay location the choice of breakfast was fantastic, everything you could want, unfortunately the hot cooked selection was cold and inedible"
5294,Denise,2021-10-31,Good clean hotel near ti Airport Bedrooms were spacious and comfortable clean Food menu was Ltd and has you are out if the way nowhere else to eat so could be a little more variety

5296,Ian,2021-10-29,"Great location close to terminal food choice is just not good enough, nice to have a good meal before departure, stayed here many times for early morning flight but food always an issue. Breakfast is good. full cover walkway and better signage, too many steps or 150meter ramp."

5303,Anne,2021-10-27,"Good Doors are sealed after cleaning, , tv remote cleaned, then it is put in a wrapper, Bed, duvet and pillows comfortable, I stayed in the hotel two years ago , the same weekend and the price was 45 pounds more expensive, I thought the price a bit expensive. I understand about the increase in cost of cleaning and difficulty in getting staff, but since I had a 6am flight I did not really have any choice, as there are also less flights to choose from."
5304,Iestyn,2021-10-26,Plupla yn hedfan short walk to terminal quiet at night food is ok - not too exciting! price is ok - captive audience pushes it up a bit

5323,Gary,2021-10-17,"Comfortable stay after a late flight arrival. Location at Bristol Airport is great. Rooms are comfortable, easy check in and an all night bar. Good breakfast. Excellent, friendly and helpful staff. Maybe just a tad pricey."
5324,Spencer,2021-10-17,Good  Menu is very basic and our meals was advertised with potatoes wedges but arrived with chips no explanation given.
5325,Duncan,2021-10-16,We like the functionality of design and service: it's just right for a before and after flight stay. Check in easy and that's what was needed at 2300 after along tiring day. Male member of staff friendly and sensitive to our exhaustion! Room clean and bed comfortable. Shower and towels excellent. Breakfast varied and welcome. Two pillows rather than one. Too late at night for us to feel like requesting this though on our next stay we shall do this in advance.
5326,Rona,2021-10-16,Perfect place to crash after a late landing flight Great location. Very good breakfast choice Room was bit small & hot

5329,Christine,2021-10-15,"Reassuringly safe, clean and comfortable Excellent facilities just a short walk from the Airport and the bus station. Everything was very well equipped, superbly comfortably and super Covid clean. I felt very safe there as a senior solo female. A bit pricey, but almost totally worth it for the convenience."
5330,Peter,2021-10-14,"Excellent position for an early flight The location alone is worth the price. This trip the breakfast exceed my expectations, you don't expect cooked at 4 in the morning and the choice of meat cheese and fruit was an improvement on my last trip. All the staff in interacted with were 100% except the guy at check out, he was 110% when I'd forgotten my jacket in the room, he looked after my bags without fuss, well done I didn't like having to order food from the bar, last time my order was taken at the table (because of COVID-19) it was not busy and could have been accommodated. This meant I had to carry my belongings rather than leave them on the table. The bathroom is excellent but unfortunately this time there was a bad sludge arould the seal of the shower tray, had I stayed more than one night I would have expected a change of room, given the price paid"
5331,Rhodes,2021-10-13,Very good Speed of check-in & out; practical Covid responses; good room layout Nothing - all was excellent
5332,Angela,2021-10-13,"Functional, convenient and clean Great staff. Preferable to driving from home for a 6am flight. Nothing"

5338,Rhianydd,2021-10-11,"Superb The bed was so comfortable we extended our check out time! We arrived late at night after a very long flight so tried to order a pizza which was advertised as a 24 hour product. We were told We had to go down to reception to order, and there were only cold sandwiches available. Not a massive deal but not as advertised either."
5339,Olly,2021-10-09,Very good Varied options. Good coffee. Practical self service.
5340,Phil,2021-10-09,"It was convenient, handy - an overall OK stay but couple of minor issues meant it wasn't excellent Walking distance from the terminal. Late night check-in was easy. Receptionist was very friendly and welcoming. We could get a drink in the bar even though it was late. Bathroom had a strange smell on first entering. May have been from lack of use or cleaning products. It was gone by morning. Breakfast was a little disappointing - though there was a good variety, what I had lacked in flavour. For the price of the room I expected an excellent breakfast."
5341,Oopsididitagain,2021-10-08,"Airport overnight stay Spacious room, very clean, very close to the airport, food & drinks available, comfy bed I wish there‚Äôs a bath tub available in the room. The room cost is quite high, I think it should have been less than 90 quid, maybe at least 75 quids."

5345,Ann,2021-10-06,Superb Location. Complimentary breakfast from 4:00am. Great staff.
5346,Michelle,2021-10-06,"Exactly what was needed Super easy check in by helpful staff, again when we checked out. Lovely clean room. Nice breakfast External signage and lighting. Could be better signposted, but if they had all the lights on it would have been easier to spot"
5347,Emma,2021-10-06,Good overnighted for airport Reception staff very helpful. Best thing is parking your car and then knowing you just have to walk 2 mins in morning to airport. Food menu pretty basic but food good.
5348,Terry,2021-10-06,"Good, but could have been better.  Reception could not find our original booking!!,and told us that we were lucky to get a room as the hotel was full. This was pretty stressful at the time. Also, despite notifying the hotel of our earlier than check in arrival time, we could not use the gym"
5349,Roger,2021-10-05,Very good Breakfast was cold (cooked breakfast). Warmer cooked breakfast.
5350,Jan,2021-10-05,Perfect location. Will use again for an early flight We book because of the location. Flight too early for breakfast Expensive
5351,Glyn,2021-10-05,Superb  Bed uncomfortable
5352,Ioana,2021-10-05,"Good The position is key here, given the lack of competition so close to the airport. The hotel is not yet old, and there is a certain brand standard that is nice to be able to rely on. Fabulous beds, nice shower and always good to have a powerful hairdryer available. The dinner was super-decent and not expensive, the WiFi signal strong and reliable for my needs, even for live streaming. Staff were generally very nice and helpful. There was something to eat even at 4am, which was helpful. A bit of maintenance is already needed; in my room none of the power outlets by the bed worked; I was lucky that the cables I had with me were long enough to use the ones by the desk. Rather disappointingly none of my calls to the front desk were answered."
5353,Smith,2021-10-05,Good pre-departure airport stay Works well as an airport hotel for pre-flight. It's also great that the breakfast is available very early in the morning The food offer is basic & could be improved
5354,Caryn,2021-10-04,"Very convenient for catching flights from the airport We didn't have time for breakfast due to early morning flight although we were able to take some muffins and pastries with us to the airport as some food available at 4.00am There wasn't anything we didn't like, although next time we come it would be good if there was more evening meal selections"
5355,Richard,2021-10-04,Smart well appointed Hotel ideal if you are using Bristol Airport Position near to Airport buildings Early breakfast Excellent Guest Room Nothing
5356,Peter,2021-10-03,"Convenient for airport - a good choice if travelling early morning. The location - near the airport and car parks. Clean and tidy, though quite basic, room. Everything worked fine. The staff were very helpful. It will be our hotel of choice when using Bristol airport. Shame a covered walkway couldn't have been designed in to reach the terminal. Expected a bit more in the way of food - limited choice. Expected more for the price paid. Had the feel of a budget hotel."
5357,Emma,2021-10-03,Very good Location brilliant breakfast selection good Price was cheaper after I.had booked
5358,Michelle,2021-09-30,Good Very clean and comfortable Close to airport

5360,Mark,2021-09-30,"NICE AND QUIET WOULD STAY AGAIN SHOULD THE OCCASSION ARRIVE, BUT MAYBE A LITTLE PRICEY AT ¬£157. EVENING MEAL OF A CURRY WAS VERY NICE, BREAKFAST WAS FANTASTIC ABSOLUTLY NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT AND 100 YARDS FROM THE AIRPORT. METAL BED FRAME WAS A BIT NOISY. TV DID ON OCCASION FREEZE"
5361,Kevin,2021-09-30,Superb For Airport best location

5363,Peter,2021-09-28,Good start and end to our flights Good price on the simple meals available Price of a glass of wine well over the top
5364,Kathryn,2021-09-27,"A typical airport hotel where you are there of one night only. Most things were to my satisfaction. Everything was as it should be, the room clean and tidy. The Receptionists were very helpful with instructing me to collect a trolley, and then they stored it, for me, in the Luggage Room, to assist with my baggage and early morning 4am start. There is a ramp up to the airport that made pushing a laden trolley much easier. I thought the menu was very poor, giving an extremely limited choice. If you liked any type of burger you were catered for! I plumped for Cream of Tomato Soup - out of a tin - and a baked potato with a chilli con carne filling. (they wouldn't need a chef to rustle that up) I was expecting Dinner! - Nope! Also, there was a horrible B.O. odour in the room, on arrival."
5365,Claire,2021-09-27,Good Good chouse It was quite cold by the time I got back to my table
5366,Nick,2021-09-26,"Perfect for airport travel Beautifully clean, comfortable beds and friendly staff Had to jump to get onto the toilet"
5367,June,2021-09-26,"Very good Room was excellent, staff very friendly Didn‚Äôt have breakfast as flight was really early. Dinner was disappointing but this could have been due to the current situation."
5368,Rebecca,2021-09-25,"Very good Restaurant open until 22.00, good food."
5369,Lesley,2021-09-25,"Lovely quiet modern hotel Room spacious, comfortable, clean, modern and quiet. Breakfast-time was relaxed with plentiful choice. Staff friendly and helpful. Parking readily available in hotel car park. My partner found the pillow too thin and unsupportive, and there weren't any more in the room. I would have liked to have seen a few more interesting items on the menu."
5370,Pamela,2021-09-24,A perfectly good place to stay. Perfectly placed for the airport. Crisp clean bedroom. Light breakfast available for an early get away I understand why the checking in & out process is virtually contact less but I miss the human touch.
5371,Vicki,2021-09-24,relaxing all service was good nothing
5372,Mark,2021-09-24,"Very good The location of the hotel is perfect if you arrive late at the airport (or if you have an early flight). The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The breakfast is very much ‚Äòoff the production line‚Äô, with the fruit out of tins. It is okay but nowhere near the best we have had at a hotel."
5373,Helena,2021-09-24,Superb Amazing location if you have an early flight. Super clean and comfortable.
5374,Angela,2021-09-24,"Very enjoyable stay after a holiday. As a vegetarian good choice cooked breakfast, good selection to eat and drink. Only thing was no extra pillows in room got in bed and pillows bit flat."
5375,Matthew,2021-09-23,"Highly recommended for early departures and late arrivals Always reliable hotel, great for late arrivals or early departures. The rooms are beautifully appointed and quiet, soundproofing must be good. The staff are friendly and helpful. My wife had to make a trip into Bristol in the morning (losing our spot in the long stay which doesn‚Äôt allow reentry) but the hotel were happy for her to park in the hotel car park when she got back, which was very much appreciated. There was a technical problem between the booking.com and Hilton systems which meant that we were initially overcharged for our room, but the front desk were very helpful in sorting it out and fully refunding the difference. It would be great to have some kind of rapid checkin for late flight arrivals as everyone arrives at once and is so tired."
5376,Anthony,2021-09-23,Good  Breakfast cold at 7am very poor
5377,Frances,2021-09-23,"Very good Comfy room, lovely breakfast, cleanliness and a great proximity to the Terminal in the airport. For some reason we only had one pillow each. Reception did not answer the phone on many occasions for me to request two more. Had to trudge down to Reception as they did not answer and ask for pillows. Reception was manned by two people who were ignoring the telephone. That was not good."
5378,Kawasakiqueen,2021-09-23,"Superb The selection and choice at breakfast was exceptional, something for everyone, The room was very clean, spacious, and comfortable, The staff on hand were very friendly and welcoming access to the hotel from the airport terminal isnt great with heavy suitcases due to the amount of stairs, and the acccess ramps taking you so far away"
5379,Carol,2021-09-23,Superb All the rest was OK Found it very difficult to get from hotel to airport as had to carry case up steps very hard for my age 78yrs on my own. Plus my daughter took me and it was ¬£5 just to drop me off.
5380,Jan,2021-09-22,Good Clean quiet great location Early morning breakfast very basic - could have better choice pastries fruit etc
5381,Nicolette,2021-09-22,"Excellent location and helpful staff, really clean rooms Perfect üëç"
5382,Cheershouse,2021-09-22,"Fabulous for a quick stay at the airport Good standard clean and comfortable rooms Very limited menu, if you're staying more than one night it is difficult to find something different to eat on the second night"
5383,Nicola,2021-09-21,Good location and large room Way too expensive No breakfast has left at 03:45 and nothing offered instead (paid B&B rate) Had to pay for parking on the night of our stay System to order dinner was ridiculous Small evening meal menu
5384,Euan,2021-09-21,Ideal place to stay right at the airport. Fantastic location to airport. Decent food. Very clean room. Perfect for an overnight. I'd have liked to be able to get room service.
5385,Kala,2021-09-21,Superb Friendly and professional Staff Poor basic Breakfast

5393,Roger,2021-09-17,Very good The down side was the Luke warm cooked breakfast. The Luke warm breakfast
5394,Kevin,2021-09-17,Really hate surveys! Great welcome and attention Room was a little cramped ! Less furniture would give more room around the bed.
5395,Cilla,2021-09-16,Good Closeness to airport Pillows Poor choice of menu in restaurant
5396,Derek,2021-09-16,"The stay was fine and suited our purposes very well. Breakfast was and lunch. Staff were very helpful especially the day time reception staff, couldn't have asked for anything more."
5397,Jane,2021-09-16,Flying out early meant we needed to find something the night before and this was perfect. Everything was good. I had tried to use my Hilton Points but couldn‚Äôt get anything sorted. Nothing
5398,Christine,2021-09-16,Superb Very clean and comfortable. Great parking with shuffle buses running throughout night. Very slick service Nothing
5399,Aled,2021-09-16,Superb Convenient in the airport. Great room and really good breakfast.

5401,Robert,2021-09-14,"Good Comfortable room, easy access to the airport tetminal The restaurant - limited memu and food badly cooked. Having to pay car parking for dropping off less than 5 minutes."
5402,Sherrie,2021-09-14,Great for an early flight. The location was perfect and the hotel was very clean and the staff were lovely. Food on offer done on a canteen basis which I didn‚Äôt like. Limited menu.
5403,Francine,2021-09-13,"Pleasant The hotel was extremely well located for Bristol Airport. Very clean and modern but perhaps lacking a little soul but I think that might be due to the covid restrictions. The staff were helpful and charming but there was not many of them‚Ä¶.overall a pleasant experience and I would recommend it to anyone travelling‚Ä¶.it was not cheap but it was very clean and everything worked more or less Soulless atmosphere, air conditioning broke down during the night setting off a hideous alarm"
5404,Natalija,2021-09-13,"Very clean and peaceful 2 minutes walk from terminal. Lovely clean room with good use of space. Absolutely silent, no noise factor at all. I slept very well. I also thought the staff were good and the breakfast was generous- you can eat the buffet breakfast and take coffee and food away in a paper bag for later. The hotel was fairly quiet which is good as I hate having breakfast in busy dining rooms. I think the price is a little expensive compared to similar standard hotels but it is the only real airport hotel in Bristol."
5405,Linda,2021-09-13,Great Airport hotek As Airport hotels go this is 1 of the best Excellent breakfast with great choices and meal of the day super value Nothing
5406,Gary,2021-09-12,hit the spot magic bang on bar not enough staff
5407,David,2021-09-11,Very convenient location having flown in late at night. Room was fine and quiet. Some of the tables in the dining room were very sticky and unpleasant and some of cutlery and plates were not very clean.
5408,Gareth,2021-09-11,Close to airport and made everything easy Everything Nothing
5409,Llarch,2021-09-10,Good Lilla the reception manager was very helpful and attentive.
5410,Margaret,2021-09-09,Superb Near the airport
5411,Jon,2021-09-07,Really convenient but over priced. Exceptionally convenient for early morning flights and allowed us to arrive at our destination to feel fresh. I expected to hear lots of noise but we slept perfectly. Over priced!
5412,Teri,2021-09-07,"Overnight Airport Stay Excellent position with short walk to terminal. Room was clean, comfortable and great shower! Staff were very helpful and seamless process to book in and out. Evening meal/Burger was excellent. No outside area to enjoy a drink with tables and chairs just a smoking bench to front and rear. Breakfast was barely warm, no choice of eggs, only scrambled."
5413,Darren,2021-09-07,Superb Sofa bed rock hard. You can hurt yourself on all the exposed metal.
5414,Ben,2021-09-06,Lovely stop off The facilities were amazing for travellers who need a overnight stop off between flights. There is nothing we didn‚Äôt like about the property.
5415,Ellen,2021-09-06,Very good Close to airport very convenient and good quality hotel Nothing
5416,Margaret,2021-09-05,Perfect for a one night stop over! Breakfast was just average! Location perfect after a late flight! More fresh fruit and berries for breakfast and scrambled egg that was yellow in colour not cream! and wasn‚Äôt sitting on a hot plate for hours!!! Fresh baked bread would have been nice!
5417,Aidan,2021-09-05,"Very good Location, close to airport A little bit far out of town"
5418,Christine,2021-09-04,Great location We ate at 4am so Limited continental...not great to.be honest No fresh fruit apart from dome sad looking satsumas and bananas No peanut butter..cream cheese.. bagels Only.one pillow on bed No.one answered phone Had to.go.to reception
5419,Marta,2021-09-04,Good  The breakfast could be improved
5420,Dorothy,2021-09-03,Fine for the night and great for airport Just had continental take away which was fine. Room was said to be queen but bed a king? More towel rails needed! Bathroom needed more towels rails and two pillows would have been good.

5422,Shirley,2021-09-01,Clean and comfortable Room and bed and cleanliness Pre early flight stay No room service
5423,Sara,2021-09-01,Very good excleent rooms check n covid precautions Poor choice of cereals and fruit at breakfast rest of breakfast very good not as good as a premier inn breakfast though
5424,Chriscal18,2021-09-01,"Becoming our regular pre flight accommodation. Close to the airport Food a bit pricey , but expected for an airport hotel."
5425,Peter,2021-08-30,"Convenient but not wholly pleasant. Very convenient for the airport. I ticked the box for a quiet room on the top floor, but was told that only two floors were in use. I would swear that there was someone in the room above me and it was not particularly quiet."
5426,Helen,2021-08-30,"Very pleasant stay but disappointed about lack of breakfast. The location was perfect and so was the room, very comfortable bed. We didn't manage to have breakfast as it was not available early enough. Most disappointing. We were on a 6am flight, but so must a lot of other guests be as there are a lot of flights at that time, so it would be great to be able to get breakfast earlier."
5427,Nicola,2021-08-30,Good Near departures and parking Had to wait for room‚Ä¶. At ¬£200 + I expected something amazing !
5428,Gerald,2021-08-29,"Excellent room, staff and breakfast Breakfast was excellent standard and choice. Room was of a high standard and bed was exceptionally comfortable. Staff very friendly, professional and very helpful. The time it took for reception to answer the phone. We had to chase our evening meal order ordered. We waited 40 minutes for a call to say it was ready for collection. Our order had been forgotten so we had to wait for it to be prepared. Staff were very apologetic. Food was good, worth waiting for!"
5429,Natasha,2021-08-29,"Exactly what you need Exactly what you need when your flight is at 6am. Right next to airport, early breakfast, comfy beds. Restaurant could be a bit more varied and better quality."
5430,Po,2021-08-29,We arrived at 10pm so only lukewarm water for our shower Breakfast included; close to airport bus A1
5431,Kevin,2021-08-29,Friendly efficient staff Clean .. spacious .. clean rooms .. comfortable beds ..
5432,Patricia,2021-08-29,Superb It was a perfect start to our trip and made for an easy departure for our early flight the next day.
5433,Fleur,2021-08-28,Superb Room Portion at supper a rather small.
5434,Robert,2021-08-26,Very good The accommodation was good The evening meal and breakfast were terrible
5435,Rosamond,2021-08-25,"I was happy with the facilities, very close to the airport. We did not have time to enjoy breakfast but picked up some porridge on the way to the flight."
5436,Boyd,2021-08-24,Good quality hotel Staff very friendly and extremely helpful Evening food was very limited in choice and in my opinion not the best quality. Not what you'd expect for this type of hotel
5437,Martyndurran,2021-08-23,"Needs must  Typical Hilton, no soul"
5438,Helen,2021-08-22,"Very good Very friendly staff, a really easy and quick check-in and check-out. Great breakfast! It would be nice to have 2 pillows per bed as a standard."
5439,Ben,2021-08-22,"Good The hotel was clean and modern, got a gym on sight and a bar also. And the rooms was clean and welcoming. The hotel is really nice, could recommend people to stay. The TV wasn't picking up any channels in my room when staying. It was a fair amount of money for my stay for 2 nights plus the ¬£8 per night parking. Ideal for flying out, but when staying in the area, it was a lot of money. Also the selection menu for dinner was limited, not a lot to choose either."
5440,Sneddon-hinojosa,2021-08-22,"Excellent location, clean room, and overall good value for money. Hotel was very convenient for the airport, room was very clean, breakfast was extensive with plenty of choice. Room decor was a little sterile; would have been nice to have a couple of additional pillows."
5441,Amanda,2021-08-21,"Brilliant extra helpful staff went over and above Staff, location Just wish we‚Äôd known the kingdom stay carpark was so near and we could have just parked there and give straight to departures in the morning"
5442,Richard,2021-08-21,"Can't wait to return to this hotel. Location is good. Staff are welcoming and very friendly. Rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. I have stayed here before and look forward to returning. Absolutely nothing."
5443,William,2021-08-21,Good Used a few times before so location great along with facilities Spacious clean room Great after red eye flight Breakfast is average with varied food temperature from buffet and powdered scrambled egg Extortionate price due to pandemic supply and demand
5444,Hayley,2021-08-18,"Very good Great location as only a few minutes walk to the airport. The staff are very friendly, especially the check in staff. The breakfast started very early, which worked well for us with an early flight. Great selection too! I thought the hotel was quite expensive and the dinner menu was very limited, especially for vegetarians."
5445,Joey,2021-08-17,"Excellent location but no connecting room The location next to Bristol airport (but not physically linked to it) is brilliant in particular for the weary traveler on an early morning flight. Very clean, new, functional rooms. On check-in requested two connecting rooms and was offered two rooms in the same corridor - only to find that one was a connecting room with nobody yet checked-in on the other side (the covid seal on the other door was intact). Despite this well worth it."
5446,Catherine,2021-08-17,"Ireland eve I loved this hotel, the staff were lovely and the hotel itself was lovely and clean and comfy . The only thing I can fault with this hotel was the shower. I looked forward to the shower as again was lovely and clean. However, as soon as I stepped In the floor was so slippery I went straight on my back and bruised my arm and my back badly. For me the floor is way too slippery and I nearly fell over in it again."
5447,Darren,2021-08-17,"Super convenient. We always stay here when we have an early flight the next day. We have a couple of drinks in the bar before going to bed, which is nice, We always sleep well and it saves us getting up in the middle of the night if we were to travel to the airport on the same day. Bar staff could have been a bit more efficient, but its a minor gripe."
5448,Simon,2021-08-16,Very good Clean comfortable and quiet room. Very convenient for my purpose Although breakfast included it was of v low quality
5449,Robert,2021-08-16,Very good Staff were helpful and accommodation met expectations and was clean. No issues so perfect. Clean and tidy with helpful staff
5450,Mayumi,2021-08-16,"Cool interior design excellent hotel Room was clean. Bedding quality was high. Interior design in Hampton was excellent. Gym was very useful. Although I didn't use laptop safe, I think it is useful. Communal area was very clean and nicely colour coordinated. Shower tiles were very small. They are very nice in design wise when they are new. But as it gets older, grouting gets dirty easy. I wish we have fridge in room."
5451,Geeta,2021-08-15,"Good Cleanliness, smiley staff Evening cafe food was atrocious! Overpriced!"
5452,Nicola,2021-08-15,"Easy hasselt free stay. Quick check in, parking tickets dealt with quickly. Never enough milk for me in the room, bar menu minimal and not great food."
5453,Kate,2021-08-15,"Welcome rest stop minutes walk from the airport This was a quick convenience after a late night flight. Check in was fast and while the room was nothing special it was clean, comfortable and a welcome rest. We were in an accessible room which for those requiring supportive bathroom furniture, I would recommend these rooms as these are really well equipped."
5454,Sarah,2021-08-15,"Superb Breakfast- fantastic! Early check in- thank you! Helpful staff Bed was a bit hard for sleeping! Sorry, comfortable but a very firm mattress which my back didn‚Äôt like!"
5455,Julie,2021-08-14,Very good Clean and comfortable Close to terminal Reception very friendly and efficient Pizza not as good as previously Bar staff not so friendly
5456,Patricia,2021-08-13,Excellent but marred by the above. We were able to pick up a grab breakfast for a 7 a.m. flight. The room was good and we were comfortable. The food we had for dinner wasn‚Äôt brilliant. We got a fine for going into the car park at the airport the wrong way. We are pensioners and I had asked if we could park at the hotel if we paid in advance as we have disabilities. We got a fine for stopping at a line and it‚Äôs not fair.
5457,Teresa,2021-08-13,Superb Buffet breakfast was available from 4am - fantastic for those of us with crack of dawn flights. Doggy bags available for those with no time to sit down. Restaurant open for dinner until 10pm - simple food but good. Everything was great
5458,Eann,2021-08-13,Nice hotel Nice clean hotel in good location for airport. Room incredibly dark during the night. A very dim light would of been good in the bathroom.
5459,Keiran92,2021-08-13,Very good Location was spot on and staff very nice and food at hotel was excellent Lack of pillows and room very small for ¬£155 per night

5464,Sophie,2021-08-11,"Perfect for an airport hotel Very clean, excellent and very accommodating staff, comfortable and convenient for the airport. Highly recommend. No rooms have baths which makes it slightly inconvenient with little ones - not a dealbreaker though!"
5465,Sean,2021-08-11,Good LOCATION HAD TO BE IN THE AIRPORT AT 4.00AM BUT NO BREAKFAST PROVIDED
5466,Jose,2021-08-11,"Next to Airport, perfect for visiting Bristol and surroundings. Next to the airport, perfect for traveling around the area, excellent service. Rooms are very comfortable and breakfast is nice and abundant. Nothing to complain about but Be aware is 8 pounds extra per day for parking. Everything else was superb. If arriving late maybe worth not hiring a car the same day as the hotel is located meters away from the airport main entrance."
5467,John,2021-08-10,"Summer Holiday Clean, close to Airport, good food ‚Ä¶ Nothing to dislike"
5468,Florence,2021-08-10,Superb Me airport comfy and clean
5469,Chriscal18,2021-08-10,So easy for the airport. Extra lie in before flight time.
5470,Sharon,2021-08-10,Very good Beds very comfortable. Quiet and clean hotel. Lively staff. Limited menu and mainly pub like food.
5471,Alison,2021-08-08,The best airport hotel Always stay here before an early flight if it‚Äôs available. Can‚Äôt beat the location and helpful staff. The rooms are ideal and comfortable. The holiday starts upon checking in. Food variety and quality has deteriorated since my last visit.
5472,Stephen,2021-08-07,"Business trip Nice comfortable rooms, close to the airport It's difficult to rate due to operating during covid. So overall it was the best experience that could be offered under the circumstances. Well done to all !"
5473,Ian,2021-08-07,"Great place to stay for an early flight. Location is great, very helpful staff and very clean and confortable. The reataurant menu is very small and the choice not brilliant. Needs to improve. The price is high considering hotels are supposed to be desperate for customers........This is Bristol not Heathrow!"
5474,Eunan,2021-08-06,"Very good Hotel staff where very friendly and helpful, had an early flight so missed the breakfast. Location to the airport, perfect."
5475,James,2021-08-05,Superb Very clean and safe from Covid Nothing
5476,Sally,2021-08-05,"Ok Room was clean and comfortable, easy for airport and long stay parking The eating area was not cleaned to the standard I would expect of a Holton hotel"
5477,Jacqueline,2021-08-04,"Excellent location for Airport. Location excellent for airport. Extremely Clean, plenty of hand gel and antibacterial wipes available. The rooms, beds, towels and bathrooms were really good standard. Lovely reception and restaurant staff. The breakfast selection was very good. The bar food wasn‚Äôt particularly good. Both burger and chips were bone dry and the chips cold. I think the burgers were microwaved to oblivion. Breakfast scrambled eggs were of the egg powder type, which always taste like water, not like eggs."
5478,Jeffrey,2021-08-01,surperb everything nothing
5479,Julia,2021-08-01,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend food Bed very comfortable Last time I stayed at the hotel the evening meal was basic but good. Last night had the chicken burger ‚Ä¶ not recommended. Just because there is a pandemic please don‚Äôt dumb down the food.
5480,Richard,2021-07-30,Convenient base for people needing to use the airport. Large comfortable rooms
5481,Annie,2021-07-29,Very good Quick and Easy booking in
5482,Ian,2021-07-29,"A good modern hotel in a very useful location. Excellent location. Good facilities. Well provided and comfortable bedroom. The breakfast is OK but a bit 'standard' in comparison with others in the same price range. However, satisfactory within the price. Most of the beer pumps were off."
5483,Elsbeth,2021-07-28,"Great location for the airport We stayed here the night before our flight and it was perfect walking distance to the terminal. We had dinner in the restaurant, very small menu but could be that they were short staffed or Covid related. Room was clean however the bin hadn‚Äôt been emptied from the last people staying there. Small menu choices and dirty bins."
5484,Michael,2021-07-28,Adequate Breakfast options good - takeaway Felt it was expensive for what I‚Äôd a simple one night stay with a very early start
5485,Kirsty,2021-07-27,"Very good Clean and room was nice. Easy parking Food was nice Staff shortage, therefore waited nearly 30 minutes once seated for a drink. Staff did apologise."
5486,Stanley,2021-07-27,Superb The location.next to Bristol Airport. The bed.there was dip in the mattress.not good quality.
5487,Terry,2021-07-26,Enjoyed my stay and would use again  2 pillows but not a complaint
5488,Anna,2021-07-26,Very good Breakfast and cleanliness More choice on menu for evening mesl
5489,Keith,2021-07-24,As I stayed here before it meets my expectations My early flights to Gibraltar means I can never enjoy breakfast. The bathroom was a disability bathroom with a wet room which had a level that allowed water to leak onto the carpet at the entrance.
5490,Alice,2021-07-23,Very good Comfy and clean rooms - great for an early flight. Very helpful staff. Limited options in the restaurant.
5491,Helen,2021-07-23,"Excellent accommodation in a terrifically convenient place. Excellent hotel, well appointed, extremely clean. We had very good service from staff serving the food and from Reception staff. Well done to all. The menu was extremely limited and didn't allow any real choice. The food that was served was shockingly bad - the coating on the squid was mushy and uncooked; the macaroni cheese was full of flour that hadn't been cooked out, was pale, completely lacking in cheese and, to boot, cold. The 'special' was cannelloni and that was more of the same. The hotel was very let down by the food but that can't detract from the main function of the hotel which was the provision of excellent accommodation and comfort."
5492,Seamus,2021-07-22,Superb The staff are very helpful Nothing
5493,Raymond,2021-07-21,Very good Close to the airport. 4 am breakfast provided for early flight. Helpful staff. Quiet. Comfortable bed. Fairly ordinary food and drinks
5494,Valerie,2021-07-20,made a 0700 flight less tiring close to airport. easy for early morning flight. Good idea to have breakfast bags available to eat at the airport
5495,Tim,2021-07-20,Very good Newish airport hotel. All facilities you would expect. Very clean. Breakfast totally ok. We had a family room. The sleeping couch is very uncomfortable.
5496,Nigel,2021-07-19,Good Very clean Food availability limited.
5497,Steven,2021-07-18,Very good I found the whole hotel to be welcoming and comfortable.
5498,Elayne,2021-07-18,Comfortable bedrooms and spotlessly clean Room and so close to airport Wanted a cooked breakfast but unfortunately our flight was before 7.00pm which is when a cooked breakfast would be served.

5500,Liz,2021-07-14,Good Clean and comfy.
5501,R,2021-07-12,"Good site and ideal for airport stay. Easy to find and very close to main terminal. Plenty of parking so able to unload cases easily and parking was free to resident. Staff very helpful and facilities clean and good service. Quiet with few guests due to pandemic. Limited evening meal menu, probably due to pandemic.Choice from about half a dozen items for main course and all fairly basic."
5502,Sarah,2021-07-10,Very good Handy for airport Breakfast was poor
5503,Gary,2021-07-10,PRE DEPARTURE STAY Staff very helpful Reasonable breakfast choice for early departure Limited food menu but understand this at present times
5504,Gardner,2021-07-10,Very good Great breakfast
5505,Marta,2021-07-09,"Handy stay over Proximity to the airport always a bonus especially with an early flight. Staff always friendly and helpful The pillows provided - just 2 of them, were uncomfortable and we would have appreciated additional ones being available"
5506,Simon,2021-07-08,"Table service but not enough staff. Room was very comfortable and food (when it arrived) was good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Lasagne was tasty, and plenty of it. Pizza was well cooked. Service in the bar/dining area was very slow. Took over an hour to have two beers, two meals and two shorts. Staff were not very attentive. Tables weren‚Äôt cleared and drinks orders were taken and then took 15 minutes to arrive. They were absolutely lovely and friendly, but just not very quick. Three staff in the dining/reception area to check people in and look after ten people in the bar. I can do that on my own. Place is very over priced (¬£120+ for two people for bed and ‚Äúbreakfast‚Äù, which consisted of a bagged croissant, fruit, coffee, juice and fruit juice - but they have a captive market, have to recoup money from being shit down, and can ultimately charge what they want due to the location. I don‚Äôt mind paying the money for the convenience, but they need to make it worth me spending the money. For that money I would expect a decent breakfast to be available before 0600 for a start."
5507,Julie,2021-07-06,"Very good Great location, very clean. They need more vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. No cereals for breakfast."

5518,Jess,2021-06-29,Good Handy for airport. Staff helpful Good sized room. Not very good selection of evening meal and early breakfast croissant and pastry‚Äôs did not taste at all fresh bearing in mind room was with breakfast
5519,Jaydeep,2021-06-28,Amazing staff Breakfast was amazing and the staff was super Lack of staff and parking charges.
5520,Julian,2021-06-27,"Short, utilitarian but nice stay. Limited dinner menu unappetising so ate locally Excellent and cleanly cooked breakfast ; Lauren was lovely and made our son waffles with chocolate sauce when she overheard him mention it. The car park fee was an unpleasant surprise and should have been clear; it will always cause problems even discounted."
5521,Kate,2021-06-27,Superb Clean and great rooms Not enough staff Breakfast was a nightmare
5522,Sudhi,2021-06-27,Good Manager was really good and very helpful Some of the staff was not very helpful. Restaurant menu was very limited
5523,Dorothy,2021-06-25,Perfectly located hotel with super staff 5 minutes from the airport. Incredibly clean. Very welcoming staff and comfortable rooms. Really good service in the Lounge/restaurant and a particularly great guy on reception who couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. Continental Breakfast from 4am was really helpful. Could have done with maybe one healthier dish on the menu but wouldn‚Äôt stop me returning.
5524,Keith,2021-06-24,"easy hassle free stay ,close to airport proximity to airport, lovely homely hotel lobby, bedroom great size but decor maybe not as nice as lobby and communal areas...a little stark in comparison proximity to airport but good public transport link to city if so wished"

5526,Jackie,2021-06-18,Relaxed stay over before early morning flight Clean sanitised room. Consiidering the hotel is a few minutes walk from the airport it is very quiet. early flight and due to COVID take away continental breakfast bagged reasy to go.. Expected to be reduced evening menu and it was sorry to say not up to usual standard.
5527,Andrew,2021-06-15,Very good Warm welcome although the hotel appeared quite empty. All satisfactory
5528,David,2021-06-14,"Can think of visit being bettered. Self, not into much breakfast. Wife very much enjoyed, eat well. My wife has Dementia so this was the 'good bye' visit to friends of long standing. The condition can be difficult but the staff could not do enough to help. Lovely people. Nothing"
5529,Karen,2021-06-13,"Superb Lovely staff, exceptionally clean rooms and bathroom. And so easy to walk into the terminal at 4am!! Incredibly small menu but I guess that‚Äôs due to the times we‚Äôre living in. But we managed and the food was good - especially the Korean chicken burger. The only slight negative was the size of the duvet - too small for the bed. But we were only in the bed for 4 hours before our flight so wasn‚Äôt too bad üòÇ"
5530,Karen,2021-06-09,Superb The rooms were lovely. Shower especially excellent. My bfast wasnt as warm as I would have liked but still edible. I appreciate it was very busy.
5531,Alyn,2021-06-06,Excellent service and very clean. Felt very safe during these times. Location and value for money
5532,Christine,2021-06-05,You definitely pay for being close to the airport departures The airport is so close to departures which is fabulous. The staff were very helpful and helped us with our problem. We thought the room very basic for the price we paid for the room. You definitely pay for being right next to departures. Breakfast was included but as we had a 7 am flight got a bag with a few bits in. Not quite what we expected. Could do a better job of that.
5533,Royston,2021-06-03,Perfect Room was comfy and quiet.
5534,Sonali,2021-06-02,"Next to the airport- great location for odd hour flights and very clean rooms. We had an early morning flight and chose Hampton because it is literally 5 minutes walk away from the airport. Very comfortable location. Only downside was taxi to city center was rarely available and we had to wait for 30 minutes until we got ours. For early morning flight, the hotel had arranged takeaway breakfast including juice/coffee, croissant and a fruit. It could have been a bit better but i am not complaining as i am not much of an early morning breakfast person. We took a three person occupancy room. The main bed was clean and comfortable but the sofa cum bed for the third person was very uncomfortable. That can certainly be worked upon."
5535,Iestyn,2021-06-02,Ceidrych Gwesty 1af Walking distance to airport Staff extremely friendly and helpful Quiet rooms Good bed Fairly priced car park - not airport rates!
5536,Craig,2021-06-01,"Decent hotel for the money Breakfast was really good quality and the variety was excellent. The rooms was nice and clean. The bathroom was really good with shower gel and shampoo included. Parking should be free considering the price of the rooms. Evening menu was not very good and the food quality didn't match the prices you charged. You shouldn't have to wait in a long que to get your parking ticket validated at the reception desk, they should have a better system in place for customers who have already booked in."
5537,Keith,2021-05-31,"A good airport hotel Very welcoming (Jez), very clean and comfortable room, very convenient location. Dinner meal choice was burger/pizza. Would have preferred ""proper"" (i.e. not fast food) dinner. Breakfast was good, though."
5538,Donna,2021-05-31,"Good Close to the airport Food not great (cold) but they gave us free desert which made up for it, and not long been open so we have to understand that."
5539,Yolanda,2021-05-27,Good hotel and great location Great room and location. My colleague arrived earlier but was not allowed to use the wifi as she was too early to check in.
5540,Yolanda,2021-05-27,Good hotel and great location The room was excellent and the location was perfect. My colleague arrived early and was not allowed to use the wifi as she was too early to check in.
5541,Cheryl,2021-05-26,"Airport Hotel with a friendly vibe Room was well laid out and clean. Location excellent for airport. Staff very friendly and helpful. Due to current restrictions on holidays abroad, there were limited choices for food available at the hotel. It was however nicely done and the staff were excellent. I would suggest any allergies or food restrictions are advised in advance to ensure a choice would be made available. The hotel is perfect for flights out from Bristol Airport and parking at the multistorey. Overall, very good experience."
5542,Jacqueline,2021-05-22,Good Location and cleanliness. Friendly helpful staff. Room a bit chilly and I mentioned at checkout that 2 pillows would have been preferable.
5543,Linda,2021-05-21,Superb Very friendly and helpful staff. Having to pay car parking charges. They were discounted though.
5544,Lynda,2024-05-01,The staff were the best thing about this hotel. We liked the staff. Extremely helpful and friendly and valued the customer. The location was perfect for a short walk to departures. Breakfast should be optional in case it's not needed. Bathroom very cold. A towel rail would be good. Check bathroom linen as ours had a hole in it. Parking should be free. This is due to Bristol airport taking over the hotel car park so not the fault of the hotel but negotions could take place to rectify this. Beds were very hard.
5545,William,2024-04-30,Great for trips from airport Really handy for departures from airport. Access from car park is ramped and easy to get to hotel. Serving meals and drinks can be slow depending on number waiting.

5547,John,2024-04-30,"Essential for early flight Croissant only, v early flight Needs lift & covered way to airport"
5548,Jo,2024-04-30,"Lovely stay, so close to airport after a long day. Comfortable, clean & tidy. Excellent breakfast! Close to the airport, well sign posted. Comfortable bedroom, good shower, TV worked well. Bar was well stocked, staff friendly and professional. Breakfast was amazing, one of the best I‚Äôve had in an airport hotel! Reception didn‚Äôt take my card details on check in and I needed to add this later when getting a drink from the bar. One side of bed was quite close to wall despite wide room."
5549,Anonimouse,2024-04-30,"Disappointing Convenient, of course, and completely met my low expectations. Overpriced, as cost of breakfast included, even though we flew too early."
5550,David,2024-04-29,Excellent spot waiting for flights. Location was convenient to airport Available food was excellent. Room was very nice. Staff very helpful. Nothing to complain about.

5555,Zoe,2024-04-29,Brilliant Everything Bed was a little firm but no problem
5556,Samantha,2024-04-28,Perfect for an overnight stay before early morning flight Perfect for an overnight stay before an early morning flight as the hotel is less than a 5 min walk from the airport. We were 2 adults and 2 teens and had 2 spacious connecting rooms which were quiet and we all had a very good night's sleep. Great that breakfast was available from 4am and the staff were nice and friendly. A bit pricey for a family of 4 for 1 night but we felt it was money well spent for the convenience.
5557,Richard,2024-04-27,"Exceptional The bathroom and bed are very satisfactory. The room is biggest and lied on bed then sleep fast. I don‚Äôt like staff has lots of write each other, it‚Äôs really late, we need sleep early. ü§®"

5560,Lisa,2024-04-22,Great location but rip off parking costs Great location and lovely staff but cost ¬£60 for 1 night to park my car so ruined the stay as that's just a rip off Room OK but a bit small with 2 beds in it

5562,Claire,2024-04-21,"A Little Pricey But Worth it for the Convenience The location was superb - literally a few steps from the terminal. I was up at 4am, eating breakfast at 4.15pm and on the plane and flying by 6am as I had no luggage to check in. The room was sparkling and spacious too. Loved the 4am breakfast option and flight details on departure boards in the hotel. It was a bit pricey, but I appreciate I was paying for the absolute convenience of it all."

5564,Nicholas,2024-04-20,"The dinner experience was disappointing, similar to a canteen. And overpriced for v. early departure The bed and shower After a 5 hour drive from Cornwall, due to accident on the motorway, we were not aware that the car park was not owned by the hotel and was not informed by reception that we needed to have our car park ticket validated. To return our hire car, and exit the car park, I had to pay ¬£12 for 26 minutes. I find this unacceptable."

Being given a disabled access room without asking if that was OK with us. Very crowded, little food available, long delay, and wrong meal arrived! Food poor quality and poor value for money. The room was hot, hard to control temperature and no natural ventilation ie openable window."

5584,Frank,2024-04-02,Best place to stay at Bristol Airport The bedroom was nice. We woke up at 06:00 because of the fire alarm wenon and everybody was running out. It was because a guest left the bathroom open and took a warm shower. The fog went out and set the alarm on.....Otherwise we should wake up later.

5597,Phil,2024-03-28,"Get a grip Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport, your charging big buck for this. Location wise the hotel could not be closer to Bristol Airport, extremely convenient. The lobby was dirty. The staff were not welcoming or friendly. There was a stain on my bedding and the room was cold. The breakfast was a buffet and no proper full on 'English'. Just felt that the H by H are totally exploiting the location of the hotel in relation to the airport. You expect to pay more, but not at the expense of service, quality or cleanliness. Next time I will be trying the small privately run hotel less than 5 minutes away."

5616,Christine,2024-03-17,Use the hotel for all our early Bristol flight and no reason not to keep doing so. A quick breakfast but perfect for an early flight. closeness to airport is a bonus unfortunately on this occasion the walkway was closed. Evening meal - noodles - good.

Little choice of bread, no Marmite, most yogurt full of sugar, poor quality bacon and sausage. Disappointing given the cost of the room and the Hilton name. Only good things were the coffee and helpful staff (I needed gluten-free bread). General lighting in the room very poor - no central light. No shaving mirror Very expensive but it's the only onsite hotel so they can charge whatever they want"

5626,John,2024-03-04,"A very mixed experience. Good, but not cheap hotel who failed to deliver on this occasion. After a serious problem the night staff led by Gill did their best to resolve it. While our sign in was unwelcoming, when Gill took over a few minutes later and dealt with my complaint, she was excellent and ensured that next morning we would have transport to collect our car. Great service, especially when compared to my comments below. Poor communication. Through no fault of the hotel the footpath was closed which meant a 10 minute walk with two large cases, one of which had no wheels so a struggle for two aged 78. When we raised this at the hotel we received a totally unhelpful response at the hotel check in by a rather curt man on the desk. It appears that we should have received a message by text to say if we needed help then we could get it and how. No message ever came and the text that did only explained the path closure and the long walking route. There was supposed also to be a notice at the arrivals doorway, but nothing evident at 10.30 at night."
5627,Derek,2024-03-04,Exceptional Excellent breakfast Nothing

As it was only one night we put up with it. Very poor."
5630,Andrew,2024-03-03,"Very impressive. A well designed hotel with travel in mind and the staff filled the space well! This hotel has looked carefully at the needs of travellers needing to make a quick getaway. The design of the rooms - and especially the bathroom - was exceptional . No bigger than most airport hotel rooms, it made excellent use of space. From the sliding bathroom door that 'closed'the wardrobe to the simply but thoughtfuly designed desk, bedside tables, multiple power points and superbly positioned shower controls and soap/shampoo this room had been carefully designed with the traveller in mind. No space wasted. Everything provided - even a safe. A+ facilities. The front desk and bar staff also worked as a team in a well-designed lobby and cafe. Superb. At first I did not like the fact that we couldn't book the room without breakfast - but - the way that they had set up the buffet breakfast by the airport exit door was again so you could grab a quick bite en route. Again - very thoughtful layout and design."
5631,Madeline,2024-03-03,"Exceptional My bedroom was really good. The room was clean, the bathroom /shower was excellent. The breakfast the following morning was very good plenty of different choices to have.. All in all a pleasant stay. I had an issue with my booking when I arrived.. The gentleman could not find my booking. I told him my name but continued to say he could not find it! I had to show him an email from my booking. He said my name was too long and the system did not show my surname. I felt quite stressed after having my journey to the airport. After much discussion it was sorted out."
5632,Tara,2024-03-01,Poor would not recommend Grim and dirty Everything was poor
5633,Lisa,2024-03-01,"Comfortable nights stay before an early flight. Very welcoming , clean, Tidy, Room was very comfortable Nothing"
5634,Paul,2024-03-01,Good if you can afford it Great location. Parking. Food. Pricey
5635,Leon,2024-02-27,Clean and comfortable but lacks any buzz. The location is perfect for flights out of Bristol. You can be in the airport in 2-3 minutes walk. The restaurant and bar offering are poor and overpriced for standard on offer.
5636,Janice,2024-02-26,Very impressed with hotel and staff super comfortable room. very quiet and had a very reasonably priced meal in the evening. Staff very friendly and welcoming. Had good nights sleep and very good breakfast before travelling on. Short walk across to the airport terminal probably bit more choice for vegetarians on the evening menu
5637,Andrew,2024-02-25,"Disappointed Location Noisy and overpriced, food wasn‚Äôt great either"
5638,Angela,2024-02-24,"Ok for sleep and ease for flight Next to the airport and comfy bed Flat Prosecco- poured by grumpy bar lady even after being asked not to use the dregs of a bottle continued to mix new bottle to try and fizz it up- had to ask another lady to change it, not cheap. Plus limited food choice in the restaurant."
5639,Juliet,2024-02-24,Excellent Convenience for early flight
5640,Anthony,2024-02-24,Very enjoyable Very close to airport The walkway to airport
5641,John,2024-02-23,"Good in parts Position, Breakfast, subsequent bus ride to silver car park. My pre stay email requesting sheets and blankets if possible was quickly acknowledged . On arrival told not available and accepted extra sheets, and told to ring 0 and ask for them. On doing this told blankets were available and would arrive. Later call to our room denied their availability, In a somewhat fraught manner. Perhaps a better outcome could have been achieved by indicating that my request was not possible. The other problem was dragging suitcases from the airport to the hotel when a long detour. Best wishes John Friend (A fit 87 yr old!)"

5643,Esyld,2024-02-21,"It was a necessity but until above resolved wouldn‚Äôt stay again Ease of booking, comfy room Poor signage to get in made it nearly impossible to navigate in the dark and signs pointing back on each other. Staff not helpful in helping to navigate pavement closures Door was knocked by cleaning staff at 9am - when I mentioned to reception was told it was to see if we wanted room service or had checked out - not ideal for late flights in with small children, also made my child anxious"
5644,Rob,2024-02-21,A perfect location for a pre flight stay but noisy air conditioing meant a poor nights sleep Close to airport Noisy air conditioning
5645,Karl,2024-02-20,"Exceptional Was a very nice stay, clean comfortable and inviting The only small grumble was there seemed to be a lack of correct glassware in the bar, was disappointing to be served lager in a different branded glass, and the customer next to me was also disappointed at a lack of gin balloon glasses and having to have a G&T in a wine glass."
5646,Grace,2024-02-19,Exceptional Lovely staff and we were able to have a meal when we arrived. Nothing
5647,Short,2024-02-19,Lovely relaxing time thank you. The breakfast was great very comfortable and very relaxing staff were excellent. One thing I missed was a fried egg with breakfast.
5648,Margaret,2024-02-19,"Awful, disorganised and chaotic.  The fact we had to walk in the dark to the terminal al snd the signposting was dreadful. I got lost twice, had to walk in the road, which is a health and safety issue. A simple shuttle bus service should have been organised."
5649,Philip,2024-02-19,Exceptional So convenient for relaxing prior to the flight. Great room and facilities.

5654,Colin,2024-02-16,"5 star price for 3 star experience. Comfortable bed, clean room. Very expensive for what it is. Parking stupidly expensive. Would not stay again based solely on parking price."

5660,Garry,2024-02-12,"Very good location, extremely comfortable rooms, poor breakfasts No choice of eggs at breakfast, only scrambled, Very poor bacon (swimming in grease) and inedible sausages. A choice of eggs, separate choices of fruit ie not all mixed in a glass"
5661,Carl,2024-02-12,Really relaxing experience Breakfast good and plentiful Nothing to dislike
5662,Ashleigh,2024-02-12,"Extortionate and disappointing Absolutely shocked and disgusted at the cost of parking. ¬£45 for 10 hours. Apparently 'discounted' from ¬£60. After already paying ¬£150 for one night, and then paying ¬£52 to park for 4 days at Bristol airport, this was just appalling. Will never return at that rate.

5663,Peter,2024-02-12,"Pleasant Hot breakfast served too late for our fligt We arrived the night before our flight. Parked in the Silver Zone car park, so had a shuttle bus to the airport, and then had to walk to the hotel the long way around in torrential rain as the tunnel was shut, so we and many others were soaked to the skin by the time we got to the hotel,"
5664,Nancy,2024-02-12,"Met all my needs and beyond . Very convenient to airport, breakfast started nice and early, exceptionally clean. Comfortable bed Would‚Äôve liked decaf coffee in room please."
5665,Ruth,2024-02-11,Easy to check in and out Good breakfast and easy access to the airport
5666,Beckie,2024-02-11,Exceptional It was super close to the airport. I had an early flight and it was super easy to get up and walk to the terminal (under 5mis). The breakfast was included and it was open from 4am so you could get something to eat even if you had a really early flight. Nothing.
5667,Susanne,2024-02-11,Exceptional Everything
5668,Sally,2024-02-10,Great. Just the job! Quiet. Clean. Cosy. Good breakfast. Can‚Äôt think of anything.
5669,Kathryn,2024-02-10,Great hotel with lovely staff. Clean and comfy. Lovely staff. Location couldn't be better Price of bar food was excessive. Two glasses of wine and two very small plates of pasta for ¬£40. Was still starving after I'd eaten and had to go to M and S.
5670,Craig,2024-02-10,Not fantastic Location was very good Even with the walkway closed due to maintenance Signage for the closure could be better thou Bed was very uncomfortable Room very cold And like I said above the Signage could of been better or alternative walkways/transport could of been provided Wasn't offered alternative options due to early flight we missed breakfast Carpet wasnt clean lots of little bits/fluff
5671,Deborah,2024-02-10,Nice hotel as close as you will get to the airport This is across the road from the airport breakfast and rooms were lovely and staff helpful however we didn‚Äôt know we could arrange assistance even though they knew we had a disabled person with us they never told us. I booked a disabled room and told them I had a 94 years old with me! So when we booked it said free parking by the time when we went they had started charging ¬£45!! We weren‚Äôt told and after I complained they wavered it.
5672,Peter,2024-02-09,"We want to sue you for screwing up our holiday and dismiss your incapable mangers We were advised that that there is a short connection between the Hamilton and airport 2 minutes by walk way. We arrived were told the connection was closed. This we were told we would have we would have to walk around the long side of the hotel. We were flying to Cape Verde and so had no wet weather gear. The walk is steep. I have declared Medical Conditions: Hypertension, Cholesterol levels, Angina Coronary Angioplasty, Rheumatoid Arthritis. We asked manager for assistance he said no. I was exhausted when I reached the airport soaked as the rain was extreme. On the return journey I telephoned your hotel from Arrivals at Bristol Airport. The manager informed me the situation had not changed we would have to walk the long way round but I said it is bucketing down with rain. We arrived soaked manager said it was not their responsibility. Under Freedom of Information how many other complaints have been made between 29-01-24 and 6-02-24 We want to sue you for this. You should have provided a mini bus service to the airport. You totally screwed up our holiday. Under freedom of information act I want to to know how many complaints you received 29-01-24 to 6-02-24"
5673,David,2024-02-08,Bad  The closure of the normal pedestrian route is wholly unacceptable when the alternative is a long detour. Blithely expecting your customers to haul luggage in the wind and rain beside a busy road at night is very bad for any hotel but for one that sells itself on convenience it is utterly unacceptable. You should have insisted to the contractor that a reasonable diversion was in place before proceeding with cutting off the normal route. If that was not possible you should have clearly forewarned your customers so that they could make alternative arrangements.
5674,Penelope,2024-02-08,"Only stayed as no better option Room quiet and comfortable convenient to airport Awful food choice, people queuing to order drinks and food, no waitress service. We went to M&S in airport to buy better quality fresh food."
5675,Jessica,2024-02-08,"Okay. Lovely and Clean. As we didn't arrive till early hours in the morning, we were able to extend the room departure till 2:00pm until our car arrived to collect us, free of charge, I just had to sign up to the Hilton honours. Arrived off the plane, and had to drag our suitcases in the pouring rain to the hotel, it says a minute walk from the airport but this was misleading as my daughter, friend and I walked for about 5-8 mins to get to the hotel, (maybe a car to collect would of been okay) For the price of the room, ¬£180, the bed sofa was really hard. Breakfast you had to serve yourself, tea & coffee was through a machine, the breakfast was okay but no fried eggs, only scrambled and boiled??? I am not a snob by all means but 180 for a room, service could of been better. After a long flight, hardly any sleep maybe being served breakfast would suffice."
5676,Pilotmitch,2024-02-08,"Disappointing The location was good, although the walkway was closed, which was not advised on booking which meet awful walk around in the rain and 40mph winds. The food is awful, the restaurant was freezing, the atmosphere sad. The entire stay was expensive and disappointing for a Hilton honours hotel"
5677,Kirsty,2024-02-07,"Staff were amazing. Room and facilities not so It was close to the airport. I don‚Äôt believe it was worth the price we paid for it, the room smelt damp."
5678,Joan,2024-02-07,Great Location and lovely hotel Room & breakfast were lovely. Nothing.
5679,Sarah,2024-02-07,Good. Really clean hotel room and had 24hr reception. Food was good ( not alot of choice) but what I had was very good. Bit expensive and works to existing footpath meant a long walk around the road to the entrance with heavy luggage.
5680,Sandra,2024-02-07,"Convenient, friendly but expensive for the level of comfort you get Great location for airport and staff super friendly and breakfast plentiful Bed quite hard and rubbish pillows - the kind that look plump but squash down flat when you sleep on them (so one is too thin but two is too high)! There is a lot of construction going on at the airport so the pedestrian access between parking, hotel and airport is a bit all over the place at the moment"
5681,Lawrence,2024-02-06,Excellent Everything
5682,James,2024-02-06,Disappointing pre holiday stay Airport on site location within easy walking distance to terminal. The evening menu lacked inspiration and the quality of the food was woefully inadequate.
5683,Mike,2024-02-05,"Pleasant That it is close to the airport Access was poor due to building works and badly signed.The bedroom was good but heating poor. The facilities provided for the lounge,bar and restaurant were very minimal which also describes the menu."
5684,Nicholas,2024-02-05,Will probably use the hotel again when we have a very early flight Access to airport Walkway was closed due to major work Special Assistance had to pick up 3 hours before flight 4.25 am
5685,Anne,2024-02-03,Enabled me to have a great rest before early flight Lively hotel and great location. Special shout out to breakfast girl who had a special smile and good morning for everyone ‚ù§Ô∏è Dodgy walk between multi story car park and hotel

5692,Mike,2024-01-30,Had it been raining I would have had to take another very expensive taxi to the hotel. The airport is in partnership wit Location next to Bristol Airport Normal access route denighed due to electric substation falling down a sink hole. Airport provided signage very poor. I have formally complained to the airport about my experience. I am not alone!
5693,Alexandra,2024-01-30,Was going to Paris Close to hotel A bit expensive
5694,Gillian,2024-01-28,Put up with it as the only hotel in the airport Close to airport Rooms freezing and so was public areas. Food depressingly poor and expensive
5695,Ann,2024-01-28,Disappointing stay. Location The 5 minute walk through the tunnel to the hotel became a 12 minute struggle with large suitcase and hand luggage because of poor signage diverting foot passengers due to tunnel closure. No prior warning and no explanation. Lighting in the hotel was not working between lifts and first floor nearest the airport. I reported it 3 times before it was repaired. What should have been easy became a real struggle. NOT IMPRESSED

5697,Rebecca,2024-01-26,"Wouldn‚Äôt book again .

5707,Simon,2024-01-22,Considering cost as solo traveller was disappointing but location for early flight excellent Very good curry as evening meal. Bedroom not warm enough. Duvet too thin. Shower tray drain blocked so tray filled up

5710,Laura,2024-01-19,"Expected better service for the price. Spacious and comfortable room, very close to terminal On checking in, the key card I was given initially for my room didn‚Äôt work and had to be replaced. Despite me turning the heating up in the room, it remained very cold. I eventually discovered when I phoned room service that the heating for my room had been turned off centrally, not impressed! Given it was a cold January evening, the heating should have been turned on automatically as soon as the room was allocated to a guest."
5711,Sonja,2024-01-19,Pleasant  Perfect for a lay over flight
5712,Simon,2024-01-18,Overall an enjoyable stay. The location Nothing
5713,Caroline,2024-01-18,Great place to stay for an early morning flight - quite expensive but was worth it for a leisurely start to the holiday. Location for early morning flight. Dinner and breakfast very good. Beds were comfortable. Quiet - good nights sleep. Staff were very friendly- especially the guy behind the bar. The sofa beds in the room could be improved- the metal bars on the sides are not very comfortable when getting in and out of bed.
5714,Martin,2024-01-17,"Nice hotel, bad experience with cold room. Clean hotel, nice bar and sitting area. Close walk from airport. Cold night, had to ring reception for heating to be put on, after getting in a very cold bed we awoke to no heating. Had to put on hoodies and socks. Room had a disability shower / wet room, with seat and grab rails. After using the shower water ran into the carpet area, had to put towels down to stop flow of water. Room 307."

5717,Andrew,2024-01-15,It was okay but only stayed one night. Proximity to airport. That the parking fee for just dropping off was so expensive for less than 5 minutes.

5721,Robert,2024-01-13,Convenient to terminal Location was ok Location ok. We had continental. As it was 4.30am Breakfast selection extremely poor especially as I‚Äôm a diabetic. Cereal was Only cornflakes. Just 1 type of cheese 1 type of ham. Europeans will be thinking this is not a continental breakfast. No oats or porridge u could microwave No hard boiled eggs. Making it awkward on the carbohydrate front.
5722,Eve,2024-01-13,Exceptional Location and comfy beds and rooms The breakfast wasn't the best
5723,June,2024-01-13,"Great hotel, comfortable and clean, friendly and convenient Clean, comfortable, friendly, convenient for airport. We were happy so nothing."
5724,Victoria,2024-01-12,Very convenient if you are catching a morning flight - you can just relax before flying. Great location to the airport just about 100m from the main building. Breakfast was great. Room was clean and comfortable and the gym was well equipped. i picked up a good deal otherwise it would have been too expensive as a solo traveller. It was all good.
5725,Christopher,2024-01-12,I would definitely stay in the hotel again Very clean and comfortable. Good atmosphere amongst staff. Excellent food and customer service.
5726,Wendy,2024-01-11,"Hotel ok, parking absolute rip off and no drop off point fornpeipme who don't need to park Continental was ok We are going to get a fine because someone dropped us off outside the hotel and just like that there was a camera van there. When asked why that was and why we were not told there was no drop off point we were told that you were allowed 1 hour free parking. When you werent looking for parking why would you look to see parking charges. Absolute rip off. Won't stay there again."

5730,Timothy,2024-01-11,Nice hotel. people suck!  The staff wouldn't validate my car parking ticket when i returned to my car as promised to me by the ginger guy on the desk. Therefore the car park reduced rate was not applied.
5731,Dr,2024-01-10,"Below average Overall experience was poor Rooms were noisy, cramped and poorly ventilated"
5732,Lulu,2024-01-10,"Very nice short stay. Convenient and easy to work everything out. Staff were helpful and had a smile to greet and help. Ahh the only thing was the toilet roll didn‚Äôt have much in it. Thought that was counting the pennies a bit too far! That said, did that really matter in the grand scheme of things, there was a new roll there anyway!"
5733,Jon,2024-01-10,Great location for transiting stays Directly outside the arrivals terminal. Age assist access to room and bathroom perfect for my aging father. Very comfortable stay. Car parking access very bad even for collecting people from this hotel.
5734,Louise,2024-01-09,"Very easy and convenient. Will be back. Loved the quite rooms, the location and the convenience of it all. The beds were immaculately clean and very comfy too. We were very grateful for the adjoining rooms. The breakfast was a bit sparce for the early flight."

5747,Lars,2024-01-01,"good value for money, confortable The breakfast was great and started so early , the location was amazing andthe room was all that it needed to be, perfect for overnight stays before travelling on to your destionation There wasn't anything that I didn't like. it met all of my expectations for an overnight stay at the airport"
5748,Jagerplymouth,2024-01-01,"This hotel takes away some of the ""hassle"" of flying. Location to airport terminal and coach stop ideal. Excellent reception staff on both occasions stayed either side of holiday. Cheerful comfy room, good sized bathroom with plenty of shampoo, conditioner etc. Good breakfasts, both continental and full English. Evening meal proportions good with fair choice of dishes, pizza option especially so! For a hotel of this standard I would have expected a toilet brush in the bath/wc room."
5749,Matthew,2024-01-01,Pleasant The hotel and staff were lovely. Being charged ¬£45 for a night parking.

5756,Lee,2023-12-29,"Expensive hotel, small rooms, great location The location is great. It is the only on airport hotel so nothing else to compare it with. The fact I had 2 rooms booked apparently. They were going to look into it as I had prepaid in full for 1 family room. The room wasn‚Äôt ready when we arrived, after check in time. Then when it was the additional sofa bed wasn‚Äôt made up. It felt like guests were an inconvenience to hotel staff. It is not the typical Hilton experience. There is a sense of arrogance in that it is the only on airport hotel so they don‚Äôt really care what you think of it."
5757,Aled,2023-12-28,Poor value for money and over priced It is adjoining the airport so is within walking distance. At ¬£143 the room is small and I expect more that a camp bed for an 11 year old. Considering Premier Inn room 2.3 miles away is as ¬£43 and included a family room with breakfast.
5758,Stephanie,2023-12-28,Great airport hotel. Great clean modern hotel. Quiet despite being on the doorstep of a busy airport. An ideal place to stay when flying from Bristol. Breakfast starts at 4am which is great. I only had time for a hot drink and a great looking fruit salad. However the pineapple and melon were so tough that they were inedible. The only edible part was the watermelon. Disappointing.
5759,Antti,2023-12-27,Not a Hilton Decent room. Some friendly staff. Rather poor and expensive food provision on-site.
5760,Ron,2023-12-27,. Everything!!! Thank you!!! .
5761,David,2023-12-26,"Hampton by Hilton not great ‚ôø bathroom was good Pillows were too soft ,bed wasn't that comfortable, We had an early flight,so had the take out breakfast bag ,it was very poor and lacked content ,1 pastry ,1 alpen bar , piece of fruit,and a kids cartoon of juice ,,,really !!! I would say for ‚ôø people ,the walk is a little too far from airport to front of hotel"
5762,Roger,2023-12-25,Exceptional Stayed in this hotel many times. When flying from Bristol Airport The good service and high standards have never changed. Not applicable..
5763,Pele,2023-12-25,Exceptional Very good hotel great staff Great location
5764,Alison,2023-12-24,Great airport hotel. The breakfast was good. The bed was perfect.. The atmosphere in general was peaceful and quiet. Not enough milk in the room for coffee & tea. No bottled water in the room..
5765,Sian,2023-12-23,"The best hotel if you‚Äôre flying from Bristol It was a perfect location so close to terminal , amazing parking too x How ASD disabled friendly staff were , the staff Laura etc went above and beyond x"
5766,Terence,2023-12-23,"No choice at Bristol Airport. Room was comfortable and clean and heating adequate and responsive. Bed was also comfortable and relatively firm. Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful as we're the young people delivering food to table, but no table service as such. Once again, the 'so called' restaurant was extremely disappointing with cold air blowing down on several uncomfortable seating positions (we moved twice!). This is probably the least comfortable pr intimate 'restaurant' I have ever patronised at any time, anywhere in my eighty years and would not have looked out of place in any motorway transport cafe. Very little choice of menu and I suspect nothing was cooked to order but rather reheated in microwave as required. Food portions were very small and quality just about acceptable. Meals and drinks had to be ordered at the bar with completely extortionate prices charged for drinks (Guiness @ ¬£4.00 / half pt., Draught bitter @ ¬£5.70 /pt.)"
5767,Sharma-burford,2023-12-22,"I was greeted by a lovely lady and immediately felt comfortable as I was travelling alone, my room was spacious and clea Very welcoming and clean Nothing it was all amazing"
5768,Bown,2023-12-21,Relaxing night before a early morning travel Lovely evening meal value for money bed and comfy and the room was very clean Had to pay to be dropped off by my son outside the hotel he was there not even 5 minutes and had to pay ¬£5 to get out

5773,Mary,2023-12-18,"A very pleasant hotel, well located and with easy access to Terminals. Closeness to the airport, so extremely convenient, very well presented and very clean throughout. Good choice of food both breakfast and evening and reasonably priced plus a well stocked bar, offering a great selection of drinks to suit everyone and the staff extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. Think it's a bit pricey overall to stay here but there is nothing I would change in the hotel or rooms."
5774,Nadezda,2023-12-18,I was looked after very well by excellent satff. Very helpful staff!
5775,Patricia,2023-12-15,"Arrived at 0100 so very tired after 6 hour flight. Had requested twin room but one was very basic sofa bed. Not happ Proximity to airport Asked for twin room, did NOT expect one bed to be sofa!!"

5777,Tom,2023-12-15,Exceptional I thought the staff where very accommodating and extremely helpful.I was asked if I had a floor preference which this was the first time having travelled all over the world that I have been asked the question.I believe that it is an important thing to have a room not only clean and comfortable but on a floor you are happy with üëçüëè. Nothing
5778,Janet,2023-12-14,"Exceptional We loved everything. Very clean comfy room, excellent food. Very friendly staff. All was good"

5780,Annabel,2023-12-12,"Excellent. From check in to check out, every staff member I encountered was exceptional in their professionalism, kindness and friendliness. Every member of staff made me feel welcome. Special thanks to Sema, who checked me in. Credit is due to housekeeping - every surface was immaculate. The shower basin was too low, the shower water flooded onto the floor."
5781,Sioned,2023-12-12,Bad Great location Poor customer service. I was charged twice for the stay and told that my card had been ‚Äúrejected‚Äù. So I was charged when I got there and through booking.com. It wasn‚Äôt dealt with well.
5782,Kevin,2023-12-11,Great location for early travel Pleasant clean comfortable
5783,Janet,2023-12-10,"Quiet night pre-flight disrupted by fire alarm going off at 1 am!!! A short walk from the Departure Hall at Bristol Airport, Ideal for a pre or post flight stopover. Comfortable and clean room and friendly staff. Being woken at 1 am by the fire alarm going off and having to evacuate the hotel, and wait outside in the cold with all the other guests for more than half an hour until the fire brigade had been and verified that the building was safe to re-enter. Someone had apparently been smoking in their room - it is a non-smoking hotel - which had set off the alarm system. Not a pleasant experience - but at least it wasn't raining outside!!!"
5784,Paul,2023-12-10,Very poor CLOSE TO AIRPORT VERY EXPENSIVE DRINKS
5785,Michael,2023-12-10,"It was booked because of closeness to the airport, would have rather had a premier inn Proximity was perfect Shower area too small"
5786,Marilyn,2023-12-10,The reason one stays at a hotel in any airport is to get good rest before flying.This did not happen The cleanliness
5787,Heather,2023-12-09,Disappointing breakfast Location Terrible breakfast
5788,Martin,2023-12-09,Pleasant Location Elongated messages are check in. No room service
5789,Andrew,2023-12-08,"Average The pizza was really good and the full English the next day was tasty. There were a lot of choices for breakfast. And the fact it‚Äôs right next to the airport is great! Really liked the shower also. It was fairly pricey for the food and drinks but that was expected. Unfortunately the one thing that affected the stay was the sleep, the bed was really uncomfortable and my partner and myself struggled to get a good sleep. It was a shame because everything else was great!"
5790,Kirsty,2023-12-08,"Exceptional All of the staff were so friendly, the hotel is nice and clean and new, and so close to the airport it‚Äôs so handy!"

5794,Elizabeth,2023-12-04,"Night before holiday The nearness to the airport & the friendly helpful staff, especially in reception. We had a problem which they helped us with & couldn't have been kinder. Not a lot of choice food wise but what we had was fine"

5796,Michelle,2023-12-02,Exceptional Very warm welcome on my late arrival
5797,Rachel,2023-12-02,Fantastic and thanks again Fantastic location for the airport. Only took us 5 minutes to walk from hotel to terminal. Staff were excellent and could not do enough for you. The hotel was beautiful. Christmas decorations were beautiful. Just loved the hotel. Breakfast started at 4 am which was brilliant as we could have food before our flight at 6.30am. Will definitely be staying there again with my family. Nothing.
5798,Acb2312,2023-11-29,Exceptional Great hotel for airport access. Very comfortable and spacious rooms. Excellent amenities. More low fat healthy options on menu. Full breakfast to start earlier than 6am.

5800,Johanne,2023-11-26,over all excellent the location
5801,Jane,2023-11-24,"Disappointing Proximity to airport There are major works on the airport site and there was quite a hike in the cold and rain that I hadn‚Äôt planned for. My husband has mobility issues and the reason for staying at the airport hotel was to make the journey easier. Room was also not well laid out; a double bed was so close to the wall that it was impossible to get in and out of bed,"
5802,Lewis,2023-11-21,"spot on, close to airport, great hotel Close to airport, clean, spacious rooms, good food and drink downstairs, especially the pizza which was excellent, would most certainly stay here again the next time we fly from Bristol airport.

5805,Victoria,2023-11-20,"Adequate Close to the airport Miserable staff, rooms very basic, clinical and expensive. I would not stay there again."
5806,Krittika,2023-11-20,Exceptional I loved my stay. Hopefully would book back again on my next trip to Bristol Breakfast was served early at 4 a m but consisted of mostly sweet and cold foods. I was hoping to grab a warm meal before my flight which was at 8 but hot meals were served only after 6am
5807,Christine,2023-11-19,Perfect airport hotel Simple enough hotel but very comfortable room and most helpful staff. They arranged special transport to the terminal for me because my leg was in a splint. Restaurant is cafeteria style but very efficient.
5808,Sarah,2023-11-17,"Makes everything easy peasy! This makes everything soo easy. Multi storey right next door, and check in the other side. It‚Äôs all walkable and easy. Phew!"
5809,Jane,2023-11-17,"Airport hotel Convenient clean accommodation, handy for the airport . Excellent inclusive breakfast and ok bar food. Expensive drinks ¬£8 for a glass of red wine medium size! Noisy aircon in bedroom"
5810,David,2023-11-17,"Convenient location, good hotel just pricy Nice smart hotel, super convenient location for airport. The price we paid for what we got felt steep, really felt like they where milking the location and lack of competition for everything they could."
5811,Janet,2023-11-17,Convenient and comfortably for a short stay Great hotel for departing Bristol Airport or to stay and regroup when arriving back late at night. Comfy rooms. Food is a bit basic but it works OK as only there for 1 night.
5812,Russell,2023-11-17,Chose this hotel purely for the location as we had a early morning flight Nothing to much trouble for the staff. The bar staff were fantastic The price of the hotel bar is very excessive.
5813,Gillian,2023-11-16,"An a enjoyable overnight stay. I liked the fact that the hotel was close to the airport, and the staff were friendly and helpful, room was of a good size, bed very comfy, abd clean shower a good size. There was a very good selection of food for my breakfast. In fact I have nothing bad to say about my stay, if only for a over night stay, so much so, I've booked in again for a overnight stay in January 2024."
5814,John,2023-11-16,Completely satisfied and would visit again if need arose. Exactly what I want in a hotel. Convenient location. friendly welcome. Clean room. Convenient restaurant. I would not expect better.

5819,Stuart,2023-11-14,Stay due to flight cancellation Staff were fantastic
5820,Richard,2023-11-13,Disappointing Closeness to airport Walkway to hotel. Restaurant facilities. Price of a glass of wine.
5821,Karen,2023-11-13,"Lovely stay and close to the airport but it was rather expensive for just one night thou It was ok , wasn‚Äôt all that hot thou The breakfast"
5822,Trevor,2023-11-13,One word very enjoyable We liked everything about the Hotel the location was perfect for us staff were lovely and our rooms were outstanding. I will be recommending the hotel to family and friends. Just leave it the way it is its perfect. As the old says if it's not broken.
5823,Kerry,2023-11-12,Exceptional  Price was steep for 9hours
5824,Rostgaard,2023-11-12,Fab customer service ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ I asked them to put pictures of Bruce Lee in my husband's room and THEY DID!! Fantastic customer service. We've stayed many times as a family of 7 too and add it on to our holidays from Bristol Airport.
5825,Anthony,2023-11-12,"Pretty average, didn't think value for money Check in easy, very peaceful no airport noise at all. Quite a trek from the airport as lots of ground work taking place for the foreseeable future, pleased it wasn't raining as would have got drowned. Bed not as comfortable as expected but acceptable, breakfast average."
5826,Elaine,2023-11-11,Great hotel Lovely staff great location great comfortable bed Wish it was a little cheaper as expensive when adding onto holiday Worth it though for location

5828,Janis,2023-11-10,"Very comfortable stay, wish it had been longer access to airport, room very comfortable, loved the armchair and footstool, had dinner the evening of arrival -food very nice, staff polite, service prompt and friendly. Continental breakfast- amazing choice and variety of options I was only in hotel for 14 hours. There wasn't anything I disliked"
5829,Paul,2023-11-10,Exceptional On line The building work on the walk to terminal
5830,Clare,2023-11-09,Excellent for the night before an early flight. Close to terminal. Very pleasant staff. Great breakfast. Comfortable beds and very quiet. In the morning light and having found it the night before it was a three minute walk to the terminal. Works on airport grounds made finding it from the terminal in the dark(after twilight baggage drop) a little challenging but it was signposted and we got there without too much of a detour. It was a little expensive (quite a bit more so than the Premier at Gatwick North) as was parking which might make me reconsider Bristol as a choice as we are equidistant from both.
5831,Jennifer,2023-11-08,Needs must next time I‚Äôll drive Close to airport The food was awful.. no effort made because customers have no choice
5832,Derek,2023-11-07,Exceptional Everything was perfect

5837,Nicola,2023-11-04,Have now stayed twice and will repeat stay for early flights Perfect for airport and early continental breakfast
5838,Julia,2023-11-03,"Average hotel and expensive for what it offered. Lousy access route Efficient check in. Clean, comfortable room Booked specifically for location, this was negated by the VERY poor arrangements associated with the airport works. A ten minute walk through pouring rain was definitely not what we hoped for or expected. We paid for a convenience that was just not there. Maybe a senior manager should walk the route from the airport terminal, with a suitcase, at night in the rain and see if they think the arrangement is acceptable!!! Overall result means expensive one night stay without the expected convenience"
5839,John,2023-11-01,"The hotel was perfect for what we wanted after a long flight late at night. Adjacent to the airport. Breakfast was excellent. Staff, checking in and checking out were very helpful and friendly. All the building work which made a terrible trek to reach building."

5844,Andrew,2023-10-27,"Excellent: will stay again Everything was good: location, soundproofing, cleanliness, comfort and bathroom. The staff were first rate. I didn't bother with breakfast as my flight was early o'clock but what I saw looked good. I didn't not like anything! Will definitely stay again when travelling through the airport."
5845,James,2023-10-26,"Disappointing The room was a nice size, the breakfast was good An extremely COLD roim. I had to ask for the heating to be turned on, unacceptable, it was soooo cold"
5846,Elaine,2023-10-26,"Nice and close to the hotel , great staff , bit expensive It was fine , staff really helpful, bit of a mix up at dinner but easily fixed Nothing it serves its purpose as an airport hotel , would use it again, although it was very expensive I suppose you have a trapped audience , but we liked it"
5847,Reeve,2023-10-26,"Good clean hotel, ruined by an expensive car park. Easy to reach from the airport, large comfortable rooms cleaned to a good standard. Car parking is far too expensive, even with the discount from the hotel. Total rip off."
5848,Jones,2023-10-26,Exceptional All of the stay
5849,Tanya,2023-10-24,Exceptional We always stay here if we are flying anywhere Nothing to not like.
5850,Lee,2023-10-23,"Not our Best Experience Location is ideal for flying from Bristol Airport and one member of staff who could apologise enough for or issues we experienced whilst we were there The way we were treated when questioned over payment, which had been made through Booking.com earlier that day , in front of an ever increasing queue of people waiting to check in. I showed proof of payment via my banking app and the confirmation email I received from Booking.com . After what seemed to take ages and more people joining the queue, she eventually went and got her manager to assist with trying to find our payment. After her seemingly checking numerous monitors and with lots of clicking and me offering to show proof again , we were told that it sometimes it happens when payment made via Booking.com that both parties fail to communicate with each other. Luckily, another position was opened, and the queue subsided whilst she was still checking things and we were eventually getting our key. There was no real apology, and the manager did say she would contact Booking.com and confirm that payment had been made. On checking out the following morning, we were then questioned again for payment, to which I said this should have been sorted the pervious night and I also showed proof of email and payment again to the staff on the desk , which was then accepted. We always book the hotel on site when flying from Bristol even if we are travelling on a later flight the following day, so we can start our holiday as relaxed as possible, but we really didn't feel relaxed this time."
5851,Natasha,2023-10-23,"We will be back!! Perfect location for meeting up with other family members and catching a flight the next day. Rooms were lovely and clean, beds comfortable and facilities were top notch!! Booked again for another night very soon. Forgot to buy toothpaste so begrudgingly had to pay ¬£2.99 for the worlds smallest tube of toothpaste and toothbrush, as it was the Hilton,something like that should be complimentary."
5852,Jude,2023-10-23,Exceptional Handy for airport Expensive
5853,Russ,2023-10-22,"Disappointing  Because of building work, the route to the airport was tortuous for someone who needed a wheelchair. There was no warning of this. Our room had an unpleasant smell. The reception/ bar area was stark, unwelcoming and over priced, with a mediocre food menu."
5854,Graham,2023-10-22,Made the start of holiday very easy and straight forward Super convenient for airport and early flight Car park for hotel super expensive

5861,Betsylita,2023-10-19,"Great place to stay when you have an early flight. No complaints at all. I had an early flight the next day so decided to stay at the Hampton. This is a great hotel - yes, somewhat expensive at about $200, but worth it for the convenience and the amenities. Easy dining experience (order at bar and food delivered to table). Lots of sitting areas. The room was excellent, spacious, comfortable, quiet, good quality all around. Probably a 10 minute walk to the airport, especially as at the time I stayed (early October) there was a lot of construction requiring a circuitous path to the terminal. Nothing"

5869,Anne,2023-10-18,"Rather soul-less place. Does what it says on the tin, everything there for breakfast. Room was clean and the tea/coffee facilities good. Shower and hair products in bathroom good, too. Our biggest bugbear. The floor of the shower was so slippery. It was highly dangerous and needs sorting before someone really hurts themselves, if they haven't already. Whatever products are being used to clean the shower floor need looking into."

Thank you Perhaps a quicker route from the airport to the hotel while the road works are being done? Maybe it just wasn‚Äôt possible because of the work that‚Äôs being done.

5898,Andrew,2023-10-04,Very bad!! Would avoid! Not much to say we did like The room was small and basic! Not worth ¬£173 per night! And what they serve for food on the night menu is an absolute rip off! Sandwiches with stale bread and a little salad and a few crisps on the side! Paying top prices!

5903,Anne,2023-10-02,"Midnight fire alarm wrecked the experience. Friendly efficient staff, good choice of food in pleasant restaurant. Good packed breakfast. Staff excellent during fire alarm giving out emergency blankets and ensuring no panic. Proximity to airport. Fire alarm at midnight meant an hour in the car park waiting for three fire engines. This wasn‚Äôt the hotel‚Äôs fault but it wrecked my stay and I had no sleep afterwards because I had to get up at 3am for my flight. I also didn‚Äôt like my taxi having to pay ¬£5 just to drop me off at the entrance."

5913,Sernaglia,2023-09-29,"Beautiful, clean with convenient location but the food does not match its standard. Nice, clean and comfortable bedroom/bathroom and proximity to the airport. We appreciated a very early breakfast. A very small selection of food for diner a very poor quality specially for the burgers . For te standard of this hotel( not inexpensive) definitely a much better food."

Amazing staff - who as you can imagine were overwhelmed with angry & despondent passengers - clean, quiet and an easy walk to the terminal The staff even called him to wake him up for his 6.30 flight as this momma was worried he‚Äôd sleep through his alarm!!!"
5922,Kathryn,2023-09-26,Great way to start our holiday The room was lovely. It was clean and tidy and very comfortable. The 4am breakfast was perfect. The restaurant dinner was expensive and disappointing.

5924,Cynthia,2023-09-25,"Lovely Hotel Well kept, quiet and comfy room. The bed was great. Nice staff. I wish there had been more variety in the restaurant. I am gluten free (NOT Celiac) and aside from salad with things missing and tomato soup which is too acidic, there was nothing for me to eat, I could have done without the fire alarm just after midnight. An hour or so in the breezy parking lot with everyone, dressed only my pajamas was interesting but very cold entertainment despite everyone being considerate and helpful. I stupidly left everything in my room, including my coat. They eventually brought us blankets. It was worse for the parents with kids. It's always important that the whole hotel got checked out by firemen but then I had to get up before 4 am to catch my flight."

5928,Alice,2023-09-24,"uncomfortable, sleepless, overpriced Did not get my requested wake up call, and when I told a member of staff this, instead of apologising, he simply insisted that you had called.

5935,Jane,2023-09-21,Disturbed night sleep detracted from the advantage of being close to airport We didn t have breakfast at the hotel we had a breakfast bag because our flight was early. Fire alarm went off at 11.45 pm Tuesday 20th. Wd waited outside for over an hour. Luckily it wasn't raining. This disturbed our sleep as we had to be up at 3.30. The whole point of staying at the hotel is to get some sleep before our early start. Does the hotel provide a room only facility.?
5936,Kay,2023-09-21,"Disappointing The location is good, in walking distance to the airport. I stayed the night, so I didn't have to get up early for my flight, but I was awoken by an alarm going off in my room at 5am. It took 10 minutes for someone to come and sort it out. When the lady knocked on the door, she said, ""Wake up, call. Really!"
5937,Bobbie,2023-09-21,"Passable The staff were all very friendly and helpful. There was an incident with the fire alarm going off at around midnight and the staff were all great, remained calm and kept everyone in the carpark warm with blankets while the fire department cleared the building. The fire alarm went off at around midnight, which no one could help. But given we had to be up at 6am for a 9 hour flight the following morning. This meant we were extremely tired as we weren't able to re enter the building until around 1 am. Also our kettle didn't work, we only discovered this the following morning so had to go to the breakfast area to get a coffee which we hadn't intended on doing."
5938,Dorothy,2023-09-21,Mediocre Restaurant staff. Proximity to airport. Queuing in a snake at bar to place food order. When food was brought to my table it was ok rather than good. Large dining area almost like a cafeteria. Asked desk to book me a taxi and was told there was a taxi booth in the airport!

5942,Barrie,2023-09-19,"Great location, comfortable room, mediocre breakfast, has become expensive Comfortable beds. Breakfast choice was significantly better than before but still basic with cooked items looking as though they had been out for a while. Huge price increase from previous visits.

I booked months before on booking.com a twin room for me and my 30 something daughter. I clarified the room the day before flying back. On arrival at approx midnight I was told by the receptionist did I want the bad or the good news. They no longer had the room I had previously booked and paid for but had a queen bed and sofa bed. The sofa bed mattress was approx 1.5 inches thick and you could feel all the springs. At that time of night following flight back there was no choice. Neither of us got hardly any sleep. (I was told by reception the following day it is only suitable for a child."

5976,Gowercoast,2023-09-03,"Stay if you have a 6am flight and have children to get organised. Put car in Silver Zone I have stayed many times. Soundproofing is excellent and always found the rooms Clean and well appointed The location is excellent and the staff are always pleasant, polite and willing to help if they can. Expensive to stay now despite booking months in advance. No longer good value..The Food is very hit and miss. The Breakfast is cheap end quality and if you have an early flight you dont get the complete works only continental, which is Okay .The car park is expensive. The beds are hard, which is fine if you dont have any skeletal issues eg arthritis ..The pillows aren't much better. so I always take my own. As I left the car park to take the car to the Silver zone the night before. I stopped short of the road but just after the exit barrier, to reset SAT NAV. That cost me ¬£60 as security accused me of illegally stopping ..These stories are becoming more common. SO I will be giving other places a try from now on. Im done with the Hilton for now"

5986,Jessica,2023-08-27,"No water supply - entirely unacceptable!  There was no water supply when we woke up in the morning, due to a broken water pump, hence the poor ratings for comfort, value for money and facilities, and staff were completely unprepared and unhelpful in responding to this issue. We were unable to use the bathroom at all. Having travelled all day the day before and arrived very late at night, we were desperate for showers when we got up, but couldn't even wash our faces. Staff were clueless and didn't offer apologies or alternatives, it seemed no one had taken charge of the situation. Very poor from a large chain who should have effective contingency plans in place for critical services like water supply. A 30% discount was offered which was then not applied to our bill. I have complained and asked for a refund and await hiltons response."
5987,Alison,2023-08-26,"Expecting a luxurious stay but had to leave at 8.15 am with not even basic hygiene requirements met.

5988,Anne,2023-08-24,"Excellent for an overnight airport stay. Good sized room with two beds as requested, quick check in and good breakfast. Finding the hotel from the airport terminal was difficult as few signs - and roadworks made it difficult to see the access path."

5998,Stanton,2023-08-20,Would not stay there ever again. Glorified premier inn. Over priced for what you get. I was put up in a disabled room that stunk of urine. You have to pay extra for parking at the hotel. There was no mini fridge in the room. No room service and because of the location there was no shops to get food or drinks.
